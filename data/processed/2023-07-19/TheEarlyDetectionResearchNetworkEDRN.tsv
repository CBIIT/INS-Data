There remain clear clinical and public health needs to improve the early detection of breast cancer. While
mammography is an effective tool, there are issues with respect to optimizing its use and performance, and
despite widespread screening breast cancer remains the 2nd most common cause of cancer related death
among U.S. women. Through the current EDRN Clinical Validation Center (CVC) led by Dr. Li we have
validated 15 candidate biomarkers through a series of Phase 2 and Phase 3 validation studies that involved
successive series of three independent sets of preclinical samples. Outside of EDRN funding, Dr. Partridge
has led the development of novel strategies to improve breast cancer detection based on quantitative markers
derived from screening MRIs in high-risk women and application of artificial intelligence (AI) approaches in
collaboration with Microsoft. Our overarching goal is to conduct Phase 2 and 3 validation studies of blood-
based biomarkers and imaging strategies that will be integrated and jointly assessed in a Phase 4 validation
study. Supporting this goal we propose the following 4 projects: Project 1: Phase 3 validation of early detection
biomarkers for ER+ breast cancer; Project 2: Phase 2 and 3 validation of protein biomarkers for the early
detection of breast cancer discovered using a mass spectrometry-based platform; Project 3: Phase 3 validation
of quantitative markers and AI algorithms applied to MRI screening exams for the early detection of breast
cancer in women at high risk; and Project 4: Phase 4 validation of blood-based biomarkers and imaging
algorithms for the early detection of breast cancer. Additionally, we will provide biospecimens and expertise to
support high quality PRoBE compliant EDRN discovery and validation studies across several cancer types.
With the combined expertise of our multidisciplinary team of investigators and our engagement with key
commercial partners, this CVC will both lead well-justified, rigorously designed validation studies and provide
abundant resources to EDRN. Given the strength of our biomarker candidates, the sets of biospecimens that
will be used, the study designs employed, and the clearly delineated clinical applications proposed, we
anticipate that this work will yield near-term clinical impact."

Early detection of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an area of highest priority and an unmet need
for advancing public health in the United States. Certain sub-groups of patients, such as those with germline
mutations, mucinous pancreatic cysts and new-onset diabetes (NOD) are at higher than average risk for PDAC.
In the immediate prior cycle, our EDRN Clinical Validation Center (CVC) at MD Anderson Cancer Center
(MDACC): (a) facilitated the conduct of the first ever, multi-institutional, blinded “biomarker bakeoff” in PDAC by
providing annotated biospecimens, (b) completed one of the first EDRN-defined Phase 3 biomarker studies in
PDAC using pre-diagnostic samples (Fahrmann et al, Gastroenterology 2021), and (c) served as a conduit for
the implementation of additional EDRN collaborative research initiatives, including a pre-diagnostic PDAC
imaging consortium. Our renewal application represents a Gulf Coast-Great Lakes EDRN Clinical Validation
Center (GCGLEC) in Pancreatic Cancer is comprised of UTMDACC/Lyndon B Johnson Hospital (Harris Health,
TX), Henry Ford Health System (HFHS, Detroit, MI) and Ochsner Health System (OHS, New Orleans, LA) and
has three major objectives: First, to implement a multi-institutional framework for collecting the highest quality
biospecimens from patients with a variety of well-defined pancreatic pathologies (including early stage PDAC,
pancreatic cystic lesions, and other benign pancreatic diseases, such as chronic pancreatitis, benign cysts, and
endocrine tumors of low malignant potential), in order to conduct biomarker validation studies for early detection
of PDAC that conform to EDRN-defined Phase 2 and Phase 3 study design. Current PDAC biomarker studies
typically have sparse representation from racial and ethnic minorities, and therefore a major impetus of the
GCGLEC will be to address the “disparity gap” in biomarker research by obtaining biospecimens from
underrepresented minorities. Second, the GCGLEC will build upon our published Phase 3 study utilizing the
“anchor panel” of CA19-9, LRG1 and TIMP-1, by conducting four additional PRoBE-compliant studies that
incorporate autoantibodies, metabolites and additional protein biomarkers for improving the sensitivity of
diagnosing asymptomatic PDAC without compromising the 99% or greater specificity threshold. These EDRN-
defined Phase 3 studies will be conducted in pre-diagnostic cases and controls obtained from existing cohorts,
including the PLCO, WHI, and the so-called “Harvard cohorts” (NHS, PHS, WHS and HPFS), as well as ongoing
prospective cohorts undergoing accrual, such as the NCI-funded New Onset Hyperglcyemia and Diabetes (NOD)
cohort, and the Early detection Initiation (EDI) in PDAC, a collaboration between PanCAN and the NCI. Third,
the GCGLEC will serve as a “hub” for collaborative activities within and outside the EDRN, including
collaborations with investigators funded by the Pancreatic Cancer Detection Consortium (PCDC), and laying the
foundations for conducting an EDRN-approved multi-institutional “clinical utility” (Phase 4 study) for PDAC early
detection, within a CAP/CLIA environment."

This EDRN-CVC proposal is aimed at the validation of molecular biomarkers for distinguishing high versus low
risk esophageal neoplasias (Barrett’s esophagus) for the purpose of guiding selection and management of
patients for endoscopic eradication therapy (EET). Two validation studies are proposed: the first, a phase 4
prospective study to identify a patient group at low progression risk who can be spared EET; the second, a phase
3 retrospective study to distinguish individuals who following EET are at low versus high risk of disease
recurrence. Barrett’s esophagus (BE) is the precursor lesion of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), a cancer
with 80% lethality whose incidence has increased more than 7-fold in the past three decades. BE progresses to
EAC in a step-wise fashion from non-dysplastic BE, to low grade dysplasia (LGD), to high grade dysplasia (HGD),
and finally cancer. EAC prevention is based on using EET to ablate HGD BE before it can progress to EAC.
However, increasingly, EET is also becoming the default therapy for LGD, a highly imprecise diagnosis about
which expert pathologists frequently disagree, and which is applied to as many as 40% of BE patients at some
point during their course. As EET has a 9% complication rate, the result is an emerging epidemic of overtreatment
of BE with LGD. In a prior EDRN-BDL award, our team developed the “BAD” technology for early detection of
BE progression. In BAD, we used a brushing device to sample a patient’s full BE esophageal segment. We then
analyzed the DNA from this sample using next-generation sequencing technology (developed for liquid biopsy
assays) to instead detect presence of BE clones that had acquired gains or losses on specific driver
chromosomes associated with EAC. Detection of driver chromosome changes (dubbed Very-BAD), typified EAC
and HGD. In contrast, 28% of LGD showed complete absence of any chromosomally aberrant clones (dubbed
Not-BAD). We will now validate Not-BAD as a biomarker that identifies LGD at such low progression risk as to
not require EET. We will do this by partnering with the SURVENT trial, that will be the first U.S. prospective study
to follow LGD patients managed by surveillance, not ablation. A second major challenge with EET is that over
25% of patients recur following ablation (with either high risk BE, HGD, or EAC). These patients face a substantial
burden of post-EET surveillance endoscopies, initially at every 3-month intervals. In our prior EDRN-BDL, our
team identified a panel of methylated DNA biomarkers for sensitive molecular early detection of BE (currently
awarded FDA breakthrough device designation). We have further identified that these markers remain retained
in a subset of patients post-EET. We accordingly now propose a retrospective Phase 3 study to further validate
these DNA markers for molecular assessment of minimal residual disease, whose post-EET elimination identifies
individuals achieving complete molecular eradication of BE, and hence at low risk of disease recurrence and not
in need of intense post-EET surveillance. We do this by partnering with the unique UNC-BEECAB biorepository
of post-EET esophageal biopsies from patients whose disease did or did not recur following ablation."

Lung cancer remains the number one cancer killer in the United States and clinically useful biomarkers are
needed to improve early detection and diagnosis. The objectives of this proposal for our continuing Clinical
Validation Center are to push early lung cancer detection biomarkers into clinical practice while continuing to
serve as a core resource to the EDRN, as well as to our academic and industry partners. Our overall objective
is to demonstrate that biospecimen and imaging biomarkers will provide clinical utility to diagnose lung cancer
by reducing the number of invasive procedures performed for benign disease and the time to diagnosis for
cancer. Aim 1 will seek to demonstrate clinical utility of a combined biomarker and radiomic approach for
providing Indeterminate Pulmonary Nodule (IPN) diagnoses. We will expand the existing lung specimen and
imaging biorepository available to the scientific community, demonstrate the clinical utility of combination
biospecimen and radiomic biomarkers, and validate additional candidate lung cancer risk biomarkers. We will
diversify the population and enhance statistical power by recruiting from existing partnerships funded by prior
EDRN funding: Meharry Medical College and Washington University in St. Louis. We seek to accomplish three
objectives in this aim: 1) to validate the combined approach of hsCYFRA 21-1 cancer biomarker, radiomic
(HealthMyne) biomarker and a Histoplasmosis benign biomarker (MiraVista) in the EDRN Lung Team Project 2
and National Lung Screening Trial reference cohorts, 2) to determine the clinical utility of the Histoplasmosis test
followed by a Combined Biomarker Model (hsCYFRA21-1, radiomics, and Mayo Model) in a Phase 4 randomized
clinical trial and 3) to validate new candidate blood and epithelial biomarkers in Phase 2 and 3 prospective-
specimen-collection and retrospective-blinded-evaluation (PRoBE) design studies for the early diagnosis of lung
cancer. In Aim 2 we will validate radiomic risk assessment platforms in IPNs and conduct a pilot clinical
implementation trial in screening discovered IPNs. We will leverage the robust bioinformatics infrastructure at
Vanderbilt University Medical Center to capture and deidentify 800 thoracic CT scans in patients with IPNs. A
Lung Cancer Prediction Convolutional Neural Network (LCP-CNN) and the HealthMyne radiomic model will be
compared to each other and against the Lung-RADS categories. We will perform a prospective pilot evaluation
of the best performing model in Lung-RADS category 3 and 4 IPNs. To accomplish Aim 2 we will: 1) compare
the accuracy of LCP-CNN and HealthMyne radiomics 2) determine the LCP-CCN's ability to reclassify nodules
in screening patients in a prospective clinical implementation pilot study. At the completion of this proposal, we
will have 1) evaluated clinical utility of combining lung cancer biospecimen and imaging biomarkers, 2) developed
a platform within current practice to present an imaging biomarker approach to improve IPN risk assessment,
and 3) enhanced the biorepository resource for the EDRN and collaborative use."

The goal of our Clinical Validation Center (CVC) is to advance and validate blood-based detection of colorectal
advanced adenoma. Whereas blood-based testing for invasive colorectal cancer is progressing, with multiple
companies pursuing products, the ability of blood-based testing to detect advanced adenomas, the pre-
malignant lesions closest to invasive cancer, is uncertain. To optimally impact colorectal cancer incidence,
blood-based biomarkers cannot just detect cancer, they should also have sufficient sensitivity to identify
subjects with advanced adenomas. For our CVC, we organized and assembled a network of highly skilled
clinical centers including a focus on minority populations, to prospectively collect well-characterized, high-
quality blood specimens from a large number of subjects with advanced adenoma prior to undergoing
polypectomy and serially post-polypectomy. From the same clinical centers, we will collect blood specimens
from control subjects. Specimens will be collected and processed using standard protocols, and relevant
demographic and clinical variables will be captured to facilitate biomarker validation studies. Specifically, we
will use these well-characterized specimens to validate our data on the utility of original, innovative techniques
for molecular detection of advanced adenomas including RealSeqS in combination with custom machine
learning algorithms such as SignaL. We propose two Specific Aims. In Specific Aim 1, we will conduct a phase
2 case-control study to validate our novel methods for advanced adenoma detection. We will prospectively
recruit patients with advanced adenoma (N=400) and site-specific control subjects (N=400) for comparison to
the case subjects. In Specific Aim 2, we will utilize serial blood specimens systematically collected post-
polypectomy from our case subjects to determine whether our novel molecular detection techniques can be
used to predict likelihood of recurrence and potentially guide surveillance colonoscopy exams. Advanced
adenomas are the important, next frontier in non-invasive colorectal cancer screening, and our CVC is
equipped to profoundly advance blood-based detection of advanced adenoma."

1U01CA271887-01	U01CA271887	10486296	2022	Clinical Validation Center for Hepatocellular Carcinoma	"PROJECT SUMMARY
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the fastest-growing cause of cancer death in the U.S. and it is
projected to be the 3rd leading cause of cancer death in the U.S. by 2040 given the poor effectiveness of current
HCC risk stratification and early detection strategies. Specifically, HCC screening is recommended in all patients
with cirrhosis, despite annual HCC risk varying between 1-4%/year, highlighting a need for risk stratification
biomarkers. HCC screening is performed using abdominal ultrasound and the serum biomarker alpha fetoprotein
(AFP); however, this strategy misses over one-third of HCCs at an early stage and results in screening harms in
many patients. The goal of our Clinical Validation Center for HCC (CVC-HCC) is to validate novel blood and
imaging biomarkers in phase I-III studies to improve HCC risk stratification and early detection.
Translation of HCC biomarkers to practice has been hampered by a dearth of high-quality sample sets including
both stored blood and imaging. Existing sample sets also primarily include patients with cirrhosis from active
viral hepatitis, with limited applicability to contemporary populations who primarily have cured viral hepatitis or
non-viral causes of liver disease. Our CVC will create a contemporary resource with blood and imaging data to
allow for rapid validation of promising biomarkers for HCC risk-stratification and early detection in phase I-III
studies. A specific population in need of better biomarkers is patients with indeterminate liver nodules (ILNs) on
diagnostic CT or MRI, which are observed in over one-fourth of patients undergoing HCC screening and have a
high, yet variable, risk for developing into HCC (annual risk ~6-10%/year). Our group has validated a novel blood-
based biomarker, PLSec, for risk stratification and a biomarker panel, GALAD, for early HCC detection in patients
with cirrhosis and herein propose to perform a phase II-III biomarker study to evaluate them in patients with ILNs.
Our team includes national leaders in HCC screening, imaging, and biomarker validation. We are leading efforts
to evaluate HCC biomarkers including the EDRN-funded Hepatocellular Early Detection Strategy (HEDS) Study,
NCI-funded Translational Liver Cancer (TLC) Consortium, and CPRIT-funded Texas HCC Consortium. We will
leverage existing infrastructure across five health systems to create two novel resources not offered by the
current sample sets including (1) a biorepository with both blood and imaging data from patients, with and without
HCC, representing contemporary etiologies of liver disease for Phase II studies and (2) a prospective cohort of
patients with ILNs to evaluate HCC risk stratification and early detection biomarkers in Phase III studies using a
prospective-specimen-collection, retrospective-blinded-evaluation (PRoBE) design. We will work with the BCCs
and DMCC to evaluate novel biomarkers, facilitating contributions to trans-network projects. Overall, our CVC-
HCC will lead to significant advances in phase I-III validation of novel biomarkers for HCC risk stratification and
early detection, areas of need that will facilitate development of well-designed phase IV clinical utility trials."

2U01CA086400-21	U01CA086400	10484455	2022	Great Lakes New England Clinical Validation Center	"The Great Lakes New England Clinical Validation Center (GLNE CVC), a Clinical Validation Consortium
component of the Early Detection Research Network (EDRN) is a highly collaborative group of investigators
whose aims to validate biomarkers for the early detection and risk assessment of cancers of the gastrointestinal
tract. In this fifth competitive application, the GLNE continues to test the overall hypothesis that a panel of
circulating and stool based biomarkers will increase the adherence to colorectal screening and in doing so reduce
mortality caused by colorectal cancers. Based on the rising incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) among adults
age <50 in the US, and the low compliance and high mortality in underserved populations, increased emphasis
is placed on these populations. The GLNE also proposes to continue its ongoing support of EDRN discovery
priorities. We propose to address the following aims: (1) Primary Aim To expand and renew the archive of
appropriately preserved stool, serum, plasma, urine, tissue and DNA biospecimens to be used by EDRN
investigators for current and future validation and biomarker discovery research with expanded inclusion of
subjects with early-onset CRC and underserved populations. This will allow assessment of the utility of individual
stool-based, and serum-based biomarkers and biomarker panels for discriminating between individuals without
neoplasia (subjects both at average and higher risk for developing colon cancer), and those with colon cancer
or screen-relevant neoplasia (cancer plus advanced adenoma), and construction of panels of markers to
discriminate between these groups. (2) To perform validation trials of promising biomarkers discovered by EDRN
investigators, external collaborating institutions and collaborating EDRN industrial partners for the early detection
of colorectal neoplasia. In this context we propose to (a) to clinically validate (via a methods comparison study)
the performance of a point-of-care blood- based biomarker panel with the testing of serum/plasma samples
obtained in clinics serving low-income and underserved communities and (b) to clinically validate an established

The lung cancer early detection CVC has two main goals: Specific Aim 1 is to develop a blood-
based biomarker panel for personalized risk assessment, modeled for its cost effectiveness. To
this effect, substantial validation work in phase 3 studies has been done using retrospective
longitudinal cohorts to test the performance of a four-marker protein panel (4MP) as a means to
determine lung cancer risk and need for CT screening. The goal moving forward is to test the
4MP alone and in combinations with other types of markers in the screening setting, using lung
cancer screening cohorts available to the CVC. The resulting marker panel, in combination with
subject characteristics, would identify subjects who are currently not eligible based on USPSTF
criteria that would benefit from CT screening based on their risk, ultimately leading to a utility trial
for which a concept has been presented at a recent EDRN scientific meeting. The utility trial
concept also includes as an objective to test the value of biomarkers in informing subjects who
are currently eligible but not decided to undergo CT screening, about their risk through a decision
sharing process. Specific Aim 2 will test the use of biomarkers and AI for interpretation of CT
images and to personalize the screening frequency and duration. Sub Aim 1 is intended to validate
the macrovasculature surrounding a nodule (vessel number) previously developed as a
biomarker, in an independent screening cohort. Sub Aim 2 is intended to develop a validated
integrative computational model for improved early lung cancer detection that includes blood-
based biomarkers, CT features such as emphysema, presence or absence of a nodule, small
airways and subject characteristics for interpretation of CT images and to determine screening
frequency. The model will be subjected to a cost effectiveness analysis compared to current lung
cancer screening guidelines.
The CVC represents a multi-institution, multi-investigator effort with expertise in cancer
biomarkers and statistics; pulmonology and lung cancer; epidemiology; radiomics, bioinformatics
and artificial intelligence; and clinical trial design, simulation modeling and cost-effectiveness
analysis. The CVC brings in substantial accomplishments in biomarker discovery and validation
related to lung cancer screening and in CT image analysis. In pursuit of its aims, the CVC has
access to samples from a multitude of cohorts for validation studies."

Screen and incidentally detected intermediate risk indeterminant pulmonary nodules (IPN) represent a clinical
dilemma for which there is little consensus about appropriate follow up due to a lack of sensitive and specific
approaches for the detection of lung cancer absent invasive tissue sampling, and concerns about costs and
harms from invasive tissue sampling in this large clinical population. Minimally invasive approaches that could
accurately reclassify individuals from the intermediate risk group (5-65% risk of malignancy) to either low (< 5%)
or high (>65%) risk would reduce uncertainty and transform the diagnostic workup of intermediate risk IPN.
Developing, evaluating, standardizing, and validating such minimally invasive biomarkers so that they are ready
for clinical use is the goal of the proposed BU-UCLA Lung Cancer Biomarker Characterization Center (BCC). In
previous EDRN-funded work we established lung-cancer associated gene expression patterns in nasal
epithelium collected with a swab from the inferior turbinate as a lung cancer biomarker. A test based on this
innovative approach to lung cancer detection is being launched for clinical use as a CLIA LDT by our long-time

cancer in the setting of intermediate risk IPN. To further improve the ability to clinically discriminate benign from
malignant intermediate risk IPN, the BU-UCLA Lung Cancer Biomarker Discovery Lab embedded within the BCC
will develop and test lung cancer detection approaches that incorporate detection of circulating tumor cells (CTC)
using a CLIA LDT assay from our collaborator LungLife AI, Inc. as well as blood based immune biomarkers,

5U2CCA271902-02	U2CCA271902	10677825	2023	Biomarkers for optimizing risk prediction and early detection of cancers of the colon and esophagus	"Project Summary
 Gastrointestinal (GI) cancers are a major cause of mortality and morbidity in the U.S. and their treatment
uses a substantial proportion of healthcare resources. Of the GI cancers, colorectal cancer (CRC) and
esophageal cancer (EAC) account for a majority of the cancer related deaths, and both are preventable by
screening and surveillance. The current screening tests are suboptimal and have variable success.
 A major goal of CRC screening tests is to identify advanced tubular and serrated adenomas, which are
high-risk for becoming CRC, as well as early stage CRC. The risk for CRC is variable with some people being
at high risk because of family histories of CRC, hereditary cancer syndromes, or a personal history of adenomas.
High risk people are placed on aggressive colonoscopy based surveillance programs and low-risk people are
placed on minimal surveillance programs. Unfortunately, our current system for identifying high and low CRC
risk is suboptimal resulting in under and over surveillance and preventable interval CRCs. Better risk markers
for CRC to are needed to prevent interval CRCs and improve the overall effectiveness of CRC screening.
 Analogous to CRC, EAC arises from a precancerous condition of the esophagus called Barretts
esophagus (BE), which is a specialized intestinal metaplasia of the esophagus and the highest risk factor for
EAC. It is present in 5% of the US population. BE progresses to EAC through successive histologic steps of
low grade dysplasia (LGD), high grade dysplasia (HGD) and then EAC. Screening and surveillance for BE is
recommended using serial upper endoscopy, which is controversial in its effectiveness for preventing deaths
from EAC. This is in part because, as with CRC, BE patients have variable risk of EAC and are placed on high-
risk and low-risk screening programs. However, the current system for assigning risk is not accurate and the
current screening test is expensive. More cost effective and accurate EAC and HGD screening/surveillance
assays and accurate BE risk biomarkers are needed.
 We propose to develop an EDRN BCC that is integrated into the EDRN consortium and, through
collaborations within and outside the EDRN, will develop effective GI cancer screening biomarkers. We propose
to identify, validate, and develop accurate CLIA compliant risk biomarkers for CRC and for EAC in order to
prevent EAC and CRC missed under current screening protocols. Moreover, the accurate risk stratification of
patients for CRC and EAC will reduce the financial impact of current CRC and EAC prevention programs. We
also propose to identify and validate accurate CLIA compliant early detection markers for HGD and early stage
EAC that can be used in an inexpensive, non-endoscopic surveillance test."

This application proposes the formation of the Michigan-Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) EDRN
Biomarker Characterization Center (BCC). This BCC represents a collaborative, multi-disciplinary team of
academic (University of Michigan (U-M) and VUMC) and industry (LynxDx) partners focused on discovering,
developing, and scaling clinical-grade assays for the early detection of aggressive prostate cancer. Through
previous EDRN efforts, our team characterized multiple important prostate cancer biomarkers, most notably the
TMPRSS2-ETS gene fusions. Through collaboration with an EDRN Clinical Validation Center (CVC; Dr. Sanda
PI), we developed, validated, and clinically implemented MyProstateScore (MPS), an early detection test
incorporating urine quantification of two prostate cancer-specific transcripts—the TMPRSS2:ERG gene fusion
and the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) PCA3. Introduced in our CLIA laboratory, MPS informs shared decision
making after PSA testing based on individualized risk predictions of aggressive prostate cancer on biopsy. Here,
pairing the cancer-specific components of the MPS test with recent discovery of high-grade cancer-specific
biomarkers, we outline the development, optimization, and clinical validation of the next generation of diagnostic
tests – capable of reliably, selectively detecting potentially lethal cancers that stand to benefit from early curative
treatment. Our Biomarker Developmental Laboratory (BDL) will employ the experimental platform, MPS-SEQ,
for capture RNA-seq analysis of urine samples to detect aggressive prostate cancer transcripts, lncRNAs,
circular RNAs, fusion transcripts, mutations, indels, and splice variants. Our Biomarker Reference Laboratory
(BRL) will in parallel develop a clinical grade urine assay, MPS-50, for the multiplex QPCR analysis of up to 50
amplicons. While the first 50 amplicons of MPS-50 have already been nominated, future improvements of the
assay content and platform will be informed by work carried out in our BDL. To fuel these studies, our BCC has
identified urine biospecimen cohorts collected under rigorous standard operating procedures in compliance with
PRoBE criteria including the Michigan Prostate SPORE, Emory University, the Center for Prostate Disease
Research, University of Texas San Antonio Health, Eastern Virginia Medical School, and VUMC/Meharry
Medical College. The overall Aims of this BCC serve to develop, assess, and optimize MPS-SEQ and MPS-50
for identifying high-grade prostate cancer in diverse at-risk populations. Our BRL will also focus on standardizing
clinically-validated biomarker assays for consistent and reliable use in accordance with CLIA/CAP guidelines at
the U-M Center for Translational Pathology in order to facilitate network consortium studies and at LynxDx in
order to scale, commercialize, and obtain FDA approvals. As recognized by the EDRN, novel biomarkers specific
for aggressive prostate cancer are urgently needed. Importantly, our mission and efforts extend beyond our BCC
and prostate cancer, as we actively participate in the EDRN biomarker community and support continued
collaborative efforts with other BCCs and CVCs to advance the overall EDRN mission."

High-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) is the most common histological subtype of epithelial ovarian
cancer. The overarching goal of the proposed Biomarker Characterization Center (BCC) is to apply a by-
design approach based on biology of HGSOC pathogenesis and unmet clinical needs to identify, verify and
prioritize, and validate biomarkers, and to develop them into an in vitro diagnostic multivariate index assay
(IVDMIA) with the intended use to capture HGSOC in high-risk women at the early stages including i)
precursors, ii) confinement to the ovary/fallopian tube or iii) low-volume diseases in high-risk women (BRCA1/2
carriers). The biomarkers that we propose to discover and validate in this proposal are intended for early
detection but not necessarily for screening in general population. The BCC’s capability in advanced data
generation technologies, multiplexed target assay development, and bioinformatics/data science will serve as
resources for the EDRN. Based on the success of our current EDRN projects, this BCC will continue our on-
going biomarker development studies including the validation of candidate biomarkers that we have identified
through the current BDL. We propose the following specific aims:
1. To optimize and use novel specimen collection and processing technologies, and an iterative and
 cumulative process that takes advantage of our newly gained knowledge of the biology in ovarian cancer
 pathogenesis. BDL
2. To optimize and apply innovative bioinformatics, data sciences, and AI/ML tools that incorporate existing
 knowledge and data to improve discovery of low frequency biomarkers that with their functionally shared
 pathways/networks could collectively deliver an improved sensitivity while retaining a high specificity. BDL
3. To further develop and optimize the process for efficient multiplex targeted assay development with respect
 to analytical performance, throughput, and specimen volume requirement for a broad spectrum of
 candidate biomarkers using a “fit for purpose” approach. BRL
4. To optimize and apply a by-design approach to translating discoveries into clinical tests. Its application had
 been critical in the development of two FDA cleared tests by JHU team members for the preoperative
 assessment of ovarian malignancy risk. BDL/BRL
5. To provide expertise and analytical and data science capabilities to the entire EDRN community.
The multi-disciplinary team that we have assembled (molecular cancer biology, pathology, clinical chemistry,
mass spectrometry, biostatistics, data science, bioengineering), the unique, novel yet biologically and
statistically sound approaches, and our long-standing experience in biomarker research and translating
discoveries to FDA cleared clinical tests all together ensure the success of this proposed BCC."

The goal of the ASU Biomarker Characterization Center is to improve ovarian and lung cancer screening through
the development of biologically-relevant circulating immune biomarkers. The scientific approach of our Center is
based on several fundamental principles. First, that altered cancer protein expression, structure, and post-
translational modifications induce host autoantibodies to create circulating biomarkers. Second, that alterations
in microbial antigen expression (such as respiratory pathogens) also induce immunity, often detected in benign
rather than malignant disease. Third, that the protein modifications, as well as the immune response to these
neoantigenic structures, are heterogeneous between people, and that serologic biomarkers may complement
circulating protein biomarkers. We will take a systems immunology approach to discover three types of
antibodies, anti-microbial antibodies, autoantibodies and anti-aberrant glycoprotein antibodies. Our proposal
builds on our extensive experiences with cancer biomarker discovery and immunoproteomics technology
development. Our previous results on autoantibody biomarkers have been confirmed in blinded phase 2
multicenter validation studies and led to a CLIA-certified commercial blood test. Our results have shown that
multiplexed panels of autoantibodies are required for adequate predictive value. With prior EDRN support, we
have developed a set of innovative immunoproteomics technologies, namely high-density nucleic acid
programmable protein array (HD-NAPPA), contra-capture protein array (CCPA) and multiplexed in solution
protein array (MISPA), that, together with the largest full-length human and microbial gene collection at our
DNASU plasmid repository, enable us to study antibodies against the full human proteome, microbial proteomes
and the human O-glycoproteome for antibody biomarker signatures in cancer. Our Meso Scale Diagnostics
(MSD) team has fielded over 3,000 instruments worldwide, and over 700 commercially available biomarker assay
kits. Our expertise at serologic assay development was selected by Operation Warp Speed to use the V-PLEX®
serology panels as the basis of its standard binding assays for immunogenicity assessments in all funded Phase
III clinical trials of COVID vaccines. We will use our MSD MultiArray platform to migrate the top serologic and
protein markers for their utility in our target clinical applications. We will collaborate with experts on lung and
ovarian cancer screening at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Boston University, MD Anderson Cancer
Center, and German Cancer Research Center, who will also provide access to high-quality well-characterized
samples to develop circulating biomarkers to enhance ovarian cancer screening or to distinguish benign from
malignant pulmonary nodules. Adhering to the principles of PRoBE design, we will perform Phase I discovery by
screening protein arrays with cancer patient and control sera for cancer or control-specific antibodies. Candidate
biomarkers for both lung and ovarian cancers will undergo Phase 2 validation."

 Gastrointestinal (GI) cancers are a major cause of mortality and morbidity in the U.S. and their treatment
uses a substantial proportion of healthcare resources. Of the GI cancers, colorectal cancer (CRC) and
esophageal cancer (EAC) account for a majority of the cancer related deaths, and both are preventable by
screening and surveillance. The current screening tests are suboptimal and have variable success.
 A major goal of CRC screening tests is to identify advanced tubular and serrated adenomas, which are
high-risk for becoming CRC, as well as early stage CRC. The risk for CRC is variable with some people being
at high risk because of family histories of CRC, hereditary cancer syndromes, or a personal history of adenomas.
High risk people are placed on aggressive colonoscopy based surveillance programs and low-risk people are
placed on minimal surveillance programs. Unfortunately, our current system for identifying high and low CRC
risk is suboptimal resulting in under and over surveillance and preventable interval CRCs. Better risk markers
for CRC to are needed to prevent interval CRCs and improve the overall effectiveness of CRC screening.
 Analogous to CRC, EAC arises from a precancerous condition of the esophagus called Barretts
esophagus (BE), which is a specialized intestinal metaplasia of the esophagus and the highest risk factor for
EAC. It is present in 5% of the US population. BE progresses to EAC through successive histologic steps of
low grade dysplasia (LGD), high grade dysplasia (HGD) and then EAC. Screening and surveillance for BE is
recommended using serial upper endoscopy, which is controversial in its effectiveness for preventing deaths
from EAC. This is in part because, as with CRC, BE patients have variable risk of EAC and are placed on high-
risk and low-risk screening programs. However, the current system for assigning risk is not accurate and the
current screening test is expensive. More cost effective and accurate EAC and HGD screening/surveillance
assays and accurate BE risk biomarkers are needed.
 We propose to develop an EDRN BCC that is integrated into the EDRN consortium and, through
collaborations within and outside the EDRN, will develop effective GI cancer screening biomarkers. We propose
to identify, validate, and develop accurate CLIA compliant risk biomarkers for CRC and for EAC in order to
prevent EAC and CRC missed under current screening protocols. Moreover, the accurate risk stratification of
patients for CRC and EAC will reduce the financial impact of current CRC and EAC prevention programs. We
also propose to identify and validate accurate CLIA compliant early detection markers for HGD and early stage
EAC that can be used in an inexpensive, non-endoscopic surveillance test."

This application proposes the formation of the Michigan-Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) EDRN
Biomarker Characterization Center (BCC). This BCC represents a collaborative, multi-disciplinary team of
academic (University of Michigan (U-M) and VUMC) and industry (LynxDx) partners focused on discovering,
developing, and scaling clinical-grade assays for the early detection of aggressive prostate cancer. Through
previous EDRN efforts, our team characterized multiple important prostate cancer biomarkers, most notably the
TMPRSS2-ETS gene fusions. Through collaboration with an EDRN Clinical Validation Center (CVC; Dr. Sanda
PI), we developed, validated, and clinically implemented MyProstateScore (MPS), an early detection test
incorporating urine quantification of two prostate cancer-specific transcripts—the TMPRSS2:ERG gene fusion
and the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) PCA3. Introduced in our CLIA laboratory, MPS informs shared decision
making after PSA testing based on individualized risk predictions of aggressive prostate cancer on biopsy. Here,
pairing the cancer-specific components of the MPS test with recent discovery of high-grade cancer-specific
biomarkers, we outline the development, optimization, and clinical validation of the next generation of diagnostic
tests – capable of reliably, selectively detecting potentially lethal cancers that stand to benefit from early curative
treatment. Our Biomarker Developmental Laboratory (BDL) will employ the experimental platform, MPS-SEQ,
for capture RNA-seq analysis of urine samples to detect aggressive prostate cancer transcripts, lncRNAs,
circular RNAs, fusion transcripts, mutations, indels, and splice variants. Our Biomarker Reference Laboratory
(BRL) will in parallel develop a clinical grade urine assay, MPS-50, for the multiplex QPCR analysis of up to 50
amplicons. While the first 50 amplicons of MPS-50 have already been nominated, future improvements of the
assay content and platform will be informed by work carried out in our BDL. To fuel these studies, our BCC has
identified urine biospecimen cohorts collected under rigorous standard operating procedures in compliance with
PRoBE criteria including the Michigan Prostate SPORE, Emory University, the Center for Prostate Disease
Research, University of Texas San Antonio Health, Eastern Virginia Medical School, and VUMC/Meharry
Medical College. The overall Aims of this BCC serve to develop, assess, and optimize MPS-SEQ and MPS-50
for identifying high-grade prostate cancer in diverse at-risk populations. Our BRL will also focus on standardizing
clinically-validated biomarker assays for consistent and reliable use in accordance with CLIA/CAP guidelines at
the U-M Center for Translational Pathology in order to facilitate network consortium studies and at LynxDx in
order to scale, commercialize, and obtain FDA approvals. As recognized by the EDRN, novel biomarkers specific
for aggressive prostate cancer are urgently needed. Importantly, our mission and efforts extend beyond our BCC
and prostate cancer, as we actively participate in the EDRN biomarker community and support continued
collaborative efforts with other BCCs and CVCs to advance the overall EDRN mission."

1U2CCA271885-01	U2CCA271885	10486258	2022	Optimizing Ultrasensitive DNA methylation detection for lung cancer and other malignancies	"This proposal for a Biomarker Characterization Center (BCC) for the Early Detection Research
Network (EDRN) seeks to improve the management of lung cancer through detection of cancer-
specific DNA methylation. This effort includes a Biomarker Development Laboratory (BDL) which
will optimize the methylation detection methods, implementation of these methods for clinical use
through a Biomarker Reference Laboratory (BRL) with a longstanding record of molecular testing
in a clinical setting, and an Administrative Core facilitating the interactions between the BDL and
BRL, and with other EDRN investigators and the NCI. Previous work by the applicants has
demonstrated the potential of DNA methylation detection for cancer diagnostics, and they have
developed extremely sensitive assays for the detection of hypermethylated DNA sequences and
optimized the isolation and processing of circulating cell-free DNA from tumors for these novel
assays. The approach has been used to detect circulating cancer-specific DNA methylation
changes for the early diagnosis of lung cancer in patients with screen-detected pulmonary
nodules. Although sensitivity and specificity of the assay are promising, additional improvements
in the performance are required for implementation of this approach in the setting of cancer
screening. In this BCC, detection of cancer-specific DNA methylation changes in the plasma will
be further improved, and new approaches developed and implemented to address the challenges
of ultrasensitive detection of DNA methylation in the blood. In addition, we will assess the potential
of these methods to detect other common and lethal malignancies. Our bioinformatic analysis of
DNA methylation from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) has identified novel highly frequent
cancer-specific methylation events common to all cancers, including lung cancer, that will be
developed into universal cancer detection assays. The use of TCGA data has also resulted in the
identification of other methylation alterations that allow determination of the origin (organ site) of
this cancer-specific signal. The combination of optimal sample processing, ultrasensitive
methylation detection, developed with universal cancer and histology specific loci detection, will
allow improved lung cancer early detection in the setting of CT screening and management of
detection of other cancer-specific DNA methylation from blood."

The critical challenge in the clinical management of newly-diagnosed localized prostate cancer remains
distinguishing indolent from aggressive and life-threatening cancers. Biomarkers are urgently needed to
identify those patients who harbor aggressive disease and will derive benefit from definitive treatment. We
therefore, propose to apply complimentary proteogenomic-based discovery approaches to identify and then
validate molecular features in prostate proximal fluids and tumor tissues that will be utilized in accurate early
detection of aggressive forms of prostate cancer and improve disease risk stratification. The intended use of
these biomarkers will be the early identification of men at risk for grade progression and improved risk-
stratification for them.
We have three biomarker development laboratory aims: 1) Validate our existing urine-based biomarkers for
grade progression in a ProBE-compliant study selected from our own cohorts and the EDRN GU upgrading
study. 2) Develop and validate urine and tissue-based biomarkers for the risk-stratification of MRI “invisible”
high-grade lesions. 3) Develop and validate biomarkers to sub-stratify risk associated with deleterious
germline BRCA2 variants.
Our biomarker reference laboratory will develop and validate targeted clinically robust assays for multi-protein
biomarkers panels. We will also develop decision algorithms that are cross-referenced for statistical rigor and
benchmarked for optimal clinical performance. In addition to these BCC activities, we will develop robust
PRM-MS assays and statistically rigorous decision tools for other EDRN BCCs and CVCs.
Taken together, our EDRN biomarker characterization center will be a core part of the the EDRN ecosystem.
We will continue to actively participate in trans-Network activities, and to share patient cohorts, protocols,
datasets and analysis approaches and expertise. We will supplement these activities by focusing on
promoting the growth of new and diverse talent in biomarker development through fostering junior investigator
involvement across the full spectrum of biomarker development."

1U2CCA271871-01	U2CCA271871	10485564	2022	Genome-wide methylation and proteomic analysis of uterine lavage and cervical swab for  early detection of ovarian cancer	"Project Summary/Abstract – Overall
A three-decade research program developing, optimizing, and testing an annual blood-based test for the early
detection of ovarian cancer in normal risk postmenopausal women failed to show a cancer-specific mortality
reduction. The likely fundamental reason for the failure is the short window of opportunity provided by a
blood-based signal. The proposed BCC will seek to identify an alternative biospecimen for the source of signal
which has a much greater window of time for detection in early-stage disease so that an annual testing
frequency will have a high likelihood of detecting ovarian cancer during its curable stages. Due to the direct
connection of the uterus to the fallopian tube, where the cell of origin resides, a uterine lavage will likely
contain the earliest biological signals of the presence of ovarian cancer. Identifying a minimal ovarian cancer
signal amongst a much greater background of uterine epithelium cells and cellular material requires a very
sensitive test. Our BCC will build on a recently developed innovative genome-wide methylation test and
combine it with a sensitive antibody based proteomic test. Having optimized the combined test to detect a
signal in uterine lavage, the BCC will determine its sensitivity in Pap smears. The BCC will optimize the
combined test on training uterine lavage samples, validate the test on independent validation cohort of
uterine lavage samples, and assess its performance in Pap smear samples. If the optimized test is sensitive in
Pap smears, then the overall goal of a clinically acceptable and readily performed test (Pap smear) conducted
at a feasible frequency of every 12 months will be a crucial step towards an annual test for the early detection
of ovarian cancer in normal risk postmenopausal women, the population in which 80% of ovarian cancers
occur. The long-term goal is an early detection program resulting in a significant reduction in ovarian cancer
mortality. The intended use of the test developed by the BCC will be as a clinical decision-support tool for
screening normal risk postmenopausal women for early detection of ovarian cancer. Such a test will fill an
unmet health gap since there is currently no early detection test for ovarian cancer."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This multidisciplinary effort of experts in biomarker research proposes to renew their commitment to the EDRN and to lead our Clinical Validation Center ever closer to impacting patient care. Therefore we propose to test best candidate biomarkers of lung cancer developed at our and other institutions for added value in the assessment of the risk for, and diagnosis of, lung cancer compared to the standard of care. The hypothesis is that addition of imaging and molecular biomarkers measured by chest computed tomography and in the sputum, the bronchial epithelium and blood, likely in a multivariable manner, could improve the identification of high risk individuals for lung cancer and improve CT screening overall results by reducing false-positive tests. We propose a three way approach. First we will test candidate biomarkers for lung cancer development in an observational study of selected very high risk individuals from the Nashville community performing repeated measurements of clinical, imaging (low-dose chest CT) variables, as well as molecular biomarker signatures, some of which will be obtained from bronchoscopy. Second, we propose to validate the most promising diagnostic candidate signatures to each test in carefully designed prospective study of individuals presenting with indeterminate pulmonary nodules. Third, we will test a novel molecular imaging tracer in a population of intermediate and high risk lung nodules. This tracer will be compared to standard of care FDG PET, and if significantly better, should have huge impact on the management of lung nodules. Our CVC will also centralize an effort to collect and store pertinent clinical data and tissues (blood, urine, and the airways specimens) and make these resources available to the community and to collaborators within and outside of the EDRN program, including the industry partners."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We hypothesize that early detection, targeting aggressive prostate cancer, will enable survival benefits of treatment for lethal disease, and reduce harms of over-treatment for indolent disease. Toward this goal, we assemble biospecimen sample sets via rigorous SOP's in cohorts designed to avoid bias. We provide these specimens and guidance regarding study design to Discovery Labs, industry and consortia. Team efforts between the DMCC, the Hopkins BRL, industry partners, UTHSC-SA and our CVC facilitated FDA approval of the Prostate Health Index (phi - with data from our CVC's first cycle), and urinary PCA3 (with data from the current cycle). In two funding cycles, our CVC enrolled 4,821 subjects. We helped advance the TMPRSS2:Erg fusion (T2:Erg) discovery by the Chinnaiyan BDL toward actionable clinical use, completing 3 Aims with progress on the 4th: First, we combined urinary detection of T2:Erg with urinary PCA3 to improve specificity of detecting cancers with Gleason score > 7, validated this algorithm in a multi-center cohort, and showed the potential to reduce health care cost via this algorithm in men less than 65 years old. Second, we characterized community-based distribution of urinary T2:Erg, PCA3, and phi independent of PSA screening, and found race- based differences in these parameters, paving the way for a phase IV screening trial (separate proposal under review by DOD). Third, we compared prostatectomy tissue Erg expression to urinary T2:Erg, guiding the range of appropriate urinary T2:Erg cut-points to reflect tissue status. Fourth, we procured biopsies from two nation- wide, retrospective watchful waiting cohorts (PHS and HPFS), enrolled subjects onto the PASS Trial, and assembled a biospecimen set suitable for evaluating multiplex RNA's to discern aggressive from indolent disease. Recognizing limitations of T2:Erg as a classifier of cancer aggressiveness, we initiated clinical translation of a 24-gene,
multiplex RNA panel for discerning aggressive from indolent prostate cancer; showed the feasibility of this assay in biopsy tissue and urine, and identified an industry partner to evaluat this signature on a clinical grade platform. We will expand our validation studies to include imaging to assess cancer severity based on FACBC, a PET radiotracer undergoing clinical development. We are expanding the breadth of our CVC from previously being limited to academic medical centers (AMC's), to now including an urban indigent care hospital, a Veterans Administration Medical Center, and a suburban community hospital (in addition to our host AMC) so that we project enrolling 1050 African-American men, substantially diversifying the EDRN biospecimen resource. We now propose the following Aims: 1) To validate the combination of urine PCA3, T2:Erg and serum phi as predictive of aggressive prostate cancer de novo and for active surveillance; 2) To validate a multiplex RNA signature of aggressive prostate cancer in biopsy samples and post-DRE urine; 3) To validate FACBC as imaging to detect occult metastatic disease in high-risk, localized prostate cancer; 4) To collaborate with EDRN BDL's, CVC's and BRL's to advance prostate cancer biomarker development."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Advances in cytoreductive surgery and combination chemotherapy have improved 5-year survival in patients with epithelial ovarian cancer, but the rate of cure remains essentially unchanged over the last two decades. Computer models suggest that detection of ovarian cancer in early stage (I-II) could improve rates of cure by 10-30%. Sequential use of serum biomarkers measured over time followed by TVS in a small fraction of postmenopausal women with rising CA125 has proven more specific and more sensitive than either modality used alone. Using this strategy, the United Kingdom Collaborative Trial for Ovarian Cancer Screening (UKCTOCS) and the Normal Risk Ovarian Cancer Screening Study (NROSS) in the United States have shown that only 3 operations are required to detect each case of ovarian cancer. Over the last 13 years, our group has conducted the NROSS study in 4,904 postmenopausal women at average risk for ovarian cancer. Annual determinations of CA125 have been analyzed by the Risk of Ovarian Cancer Algorithm (ROCA) developed by Dr. Skates. If the risk does not change, women return in a year; if it increases markedly, TVS is performed and participants are referred to a gynecologic oncologist; if the risk is intermediate CA125 is repeated in 3 months. Fifteen operations have been performed to detect 10 ovarian cancers. Two were borderline tumors and 8 were invasive with 8 of the 10 (80%) in Stage I or II. The NROSS trial has utilized a well-coordinated network of 7 sites in the United States where 22,981 blood samples have been obtained, processed and stored with standard operating protocols. Pre-operative specimens from MDACC have been banked from 502 women with ovarian cancer and 737 with benign disease. This has provided a valuable resource for evaluating new biomarkers. As CA125 is expressed by only 80% of epithelial ovarian cancers, additional biomarkers will be required to optimize sensitivity. Our group has found that HE4 and CA72.4 can detect 16% of the cases missed by CA125 in samples from the UKCTOCS trial. Autoantibodies to tumor associated antigens have shown even greater promise. Elevated levels of autoantibodies against TP53 have been found in 20-25% of patients with normal CA125 at the time of conventional diagnosis. Titers of anti-TP53 rise 13.5 months (mean) prior to CA125 and 33 months (mean) prior to diagnosis in patients who present without an increase in CA125. At present we are developing a new ROCA that incorporates CA125, HE4, CA72.4 and anti-TP53 autoantibody data. A multidisciplinary team of 27 investigators will pursue the following Specific Aims: 1) to conduct a screening trial to determine the specificity and positive predictive value for a 4 biomarker ROCA including CA125, HE4, CA72.4 and anti-TP53 autoantibodies in a two stage strategy for early detection of ovarian cancer in postmenopausal women at average risk for the disease; 2) to maintain and share a serum and plasma bank to facilitate evaluation of novel biomarkers for early detection; 3) to collaborate with other Centers in the EDRN to evaluate additional biomarkers for early detection of ovarian cancer."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to establish the Moffitt Imaging Biomarker Validation Center (MIBVAC) focused on imaging biomarker validations for early cancer detection and accurate risk assessments by leveraging our team of strong experts, resources, planned imaging biomarker validation studies, and analysis and network collaboration structures. In previous studies we have demonstrated that various measurements from breast images quantify breast cancer risk. The large cooperative National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) also showed a significant survival improvement for individuals screened by low dose CT compared to those screened with conventional radiography. Additionally, we have recently shown that CT image analysis (radiomics) can improve classification in this data set. However, due to difficulties in obtaining accurate and reproducible measurements and high false-positive rates of current imaging, cancer imaging biomarkers have not been routinely incorporated into clinical risk assessment. If these imaging biomarkers can be accurately tailored at the individual level, their impact will be significantly improved for early cancer detection and intervention. MIBVAC plans to achieve this challenging yet quite achievable goal by rigorously evaluating and validating these imaging biomarkers for rapid translation into clinical and practical applications. We have four specific aims: (Aim 1) Establish breast imaging resources for EDRN both with our existing and new case-control datasets of breast images and to evaluate and validate breast imaging biomarkers based on newly-established case-control dataset of digital breast tomosynthesis (TS) images, (Aim 2) Evaluate and validate lung imaging biomarkers for early detection of cancer first based on NLST low-dose CT (LDCT) cohorts and then expanding with a newly-established case-control cohort of higher resolution LDCT, (Aim 3) Conduct validation studies with imaging biomarkers for EDRN partners and others for other malignancies, and (Aim 4) Refine and validate imaging biomarkers analytically for early detection of breast, lung, and other cancers and to construct MIBVAC imaging data and specimen resources for EDRN collaborations and sharing."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Continued support of the Great Lakes New England (GLNE) Clinical Validation Center (CVC) of the Early Detection Research Network (EDRN) via the U01 mechanism is requested. The GLNE CVC is a highly collaborative, multi-institutional consortium designed to develop, implement and analyze trials for the validation of biomarkers for the early detection of colorectal adenocarcinoma and other GI malignancies. Over the last 15 years, the GLNE has: 1. developed a high quality repository of samples collected from human subjects with colorectal, lower esophageal neoplasias, pancreatic neoplasms and controls; 2. collaborated with 9 biomarker developmental laboratories, 4 biomarker reference laboratories, the EDRN DMCC, and 9 industrial partners publishing 36 collaborative manuscripts; 3. Performed phase I validation trials of 26 biomarkers for the early detection of colorectal adenocarcinoma; 4. Initiated and recruited 5,154 participants to a Network-wide cross sectional validation trial of biomarkers for the early detection of colorectal cancer. The GLNE proposes to 1. Complete an ongoing prospective Phase 2 validation trial of vimentin methylation, serum galectin-3 ligand, BCAT1/IKZF1 methylation in plasma, fecal immunochemical tests (FIT), Exact Sciences stool DNA panel, or any future individual biomarker individually and as a panel for the early detection of colorectal neoplasia using colonoscopy as the gold standard; 2. To perform phase 1 validation trials (training and test set designs) of promising biomarkers discovered by EDRN Biomarker Validation Laboratories, external academic collaborating institutions, and collaborating EDRN industrial partners for the early detection of colorectal cancer, high grade colorectal dysplasia, and screen relevant colorectal neoplasms; 3. Assess the frequency of missed or occult colonic and upper gastrointestinal neoplasia in patients with initially normal colonoscopies and persistently positive stool DNA testing; and 4. Continue to expand and renew the archive of appropriately preserved stool, serum, plasma, urine, tissue and DNA biospecimens to be used by EDRN investigators for future validation and biomarker discovery research. These aims will be addressed by a multi-institutional consortium of university and community GI practices recruiting human subjects undergoing screening colonoscopy under a PRoBE compliant protocol. The data will be managed and analyzed by the EDRN data management and coordinating center."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There remain clear clinical and public health needs to improve the early detection of breast, colorectal, and ovary cancers. For breast and colorectal cancers effective, widely used screening tests exist, but for breast cancer there remain issues with respect to optimizing mammography's use and performance, and for colorectal cancer both limited access to and the invasiveness of colonoscopy are barriers to its wider use. Ovary cancer is less common but highly lethal, and no clinically useful tests for its early detection are
currently available. Through the current breast and ovary cancer EDRN Clinical Validation Center (CVC) led by Dr. Li and the current colorectal cancer EDRN Biomarker Development Laboratory (BDL) led by Dr. Lampe, we have discovered and validated promising sets of candidate early detection biomarkers for each of these three cancers that now warrant further Phase 2 and Phase 3 validation. We propose the following three projects: Project 1: Phase 3 validation of early detection biomarkers for ER+ breast cancer: Nine candidate biomarkers that have been preliminarily validated in preclinical samples will be assessed in an independent set of preclinical samples. Their intended clinical applications are to: 1. Inform timing of a subsequent mammogram in women with a negative screening mammogram; 2. Inform continuation of mammographic screening among women 75-79 years; 3. Prioritize women who should be screened with mammography in areas with limited resources. Project 2: Phase 3 validation of early detection biomarkers for colorectal cancer: We will validate five biomarkers that have been preliminarily validated in multiple sets of samples with performance that meets or exceeds those of existing fecal tests. Our intended clinical applications are to: 1. Identify people unwilling to undergo or with no access to colonoscopy who should be prioritized for colonoscopy (improve/replace existing FIT and Cologuard tests); 2. Among symptomatic patients identify those who have a very low risk of cancer and can avoid colonoscopy. Project 3: Phase 2 and 3 validation of auto- antibodies (AAb) as early detection biomarkers for serous ovarian cancer (SOC): Our overall goal is to combine novel AAb markers with currently available tests in a two-stage screening strategy with the potential to reduce ovarian cancer mortality. Our intended clinical applications are: 1. Use AAbs in conjunction with CA125 as a first line screening test; 2. Use AAbs in conjunction with HE4 for cancer early detection in women with rising CA125. In addition, we will serve as an EDRN collaborative resource providing biospecimens and expertise to support high quality PRoBE compliant EDRN discovery and validation studies across cancer types. With the combined expertise of our multidisciplinary team of investigators, this CVC will both lead well- justified, rigorously designed validation studies and provide abundant resources to EDRN. Given the strength of our biomarker candidates, the sets of biospecimens that will be used, the study designs employed, and the clearly delineated clinical applications proposed, we anticipate that this work will yield near-ter clinical impact."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Early detection of PDAC is an area of highest priority and an unmet need for advancing public health in the United States. Certain sub-groups of patients, such as those with mucinous pancreatic cysts are at higher risk for progression to PDAC, but even in these cohorts, there is potential for over-diagnosis, underscoring the need for biomarkers that can accurately distinguish aggressive versus indolent cysts. The long term goal of our EDRN Clinical Validation Center (CVC), comprised of MD Anderson (MDACC), University of Utah and Indiana University, is to implement a multi-institutional framework for collecting the highest quality biospecimens from patients with a variety of well-defined pancreatic pathologies in order to conduct biomarker validation studies for early detection of PDAC that conform to EDRN-defined Phase 2 and Phase 3 study design. Specifically, this CVC will prospectively recruit at least 600 patients with early stage (resected) PDAC, at least 300 patients with surgically resected pancreatic cystic lesions of varying histology and grades of dysplasia, at least 400 benign pancreatic diseases (including chronic pancreatitis, benign cysts, endocrine tumors of low malignant potential), at least 300 patients with non-resected pancreatic cystic lesions that have follow up of 2 years or greater without evidence for progression, and at least 300 control patients with non- pancreatic diseases, in order to obtain plasma and serum samples from these subjects for biomarker validation studies. Additionally, we will obtain cyst fluid samples from all patients with pancreatic cystic lesions, both surgically resected and those being followed by endoscopic imaging. In accordance with the EDRN principles, these biospecimens will be utilized in facilitating collaborations with other BDLs, for biomarker discovery and validation studies. Preliminary data generated in our CVC has identified a focused panel of overexpressed autoantibodies and antigens (ERBB2, TNC, ESR1, CACNA1D and CDKN2AIP) that significantly improves CA19-9 AUC in both diagnostic and pre-diagnostic cohorts. We will use a hybrid array platform developed at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC) that is capable of quantifying both antigens and autoantibodies from plasma, and use this platform to complete three PRoBE compliant biomarker studies: Study 1 will be an EDRN-defined Phase 3 study in pre-diagnostic PDAC samples (n=158) and matched controls (n=158) from WHI and PLCO cohorts, followed by an EDRN-defined Phase 2 case control study of early stage (resectable) PDAC (N = 300) versus chronic pancreatitis (N = 300) and non-pancreatic disease controls (N=300); Study 2 will be an EDRN-defined Phase 3 study in PLCO pre-diagnostic PDAC samples (n=160), and matched controls (n=160); and Study 3 will be an EDRN-defined Phase 2 case control study of pancreatic cystic neoplasms with high-grade dysplasia or cancer (N =150) versus pancreatic cystic neoplasms with surgically confirmed low-grade dysplasia and non-mucinous cystic lesions (N=150), as well as low-risk cyst with adequate follow up that are followed without surgery (N=150)."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A majority of pancreatic cancer (PC) patients (> 80%) present with an unresectable primary tumor with distant metastasis at the time of diagnosis due to its asymptomatic nature and lack of methods for early detection. While the overall 5-year survival rate of PC is dismal, signiﬁcantly better outcomes have been reported for early stage smaller tumors. PC is believed to progress through a series of histological changes and recent estimates indicate that these changes require 15-20 years to develop into invasive metastatic disease, hence providing a window of opportunity to intervene. While early diagnosis is an obvious strategy to improve the survival of PC patients, lack of non-invasive biomarkers for risk prediction of precursor lesions or early stage invasive disease impedes our ability to diagnose PC during this ""window. Premalignant cystic lesions of the pancreas offer unique opportunity for early diagnosis. To meet the EDRN stated goal of performing a validation study for early cancer detection and risk assessment likely to yield meaningful results within 5 years, we propose an innovative approach that could lead to the development of a clinically useful biomarker in this time frame. Additionally, we propose to study cystic neoplasms since IPMN and MCN offer a unique opportunity to identify pancreatic premalignant lesions and serve as a target for early detection strategies. The candidate biomarkers studies in our application have been identified and evaluated over the past 5 years in EDRN-funded biomarker developmental laboratories (BDLs). Studies from the laboratories of participating investigators have conclusively established that mucin overexpression is a hallmark of pancreatic cancer and have identified biomarkers (MUC5AC and its 2 glycoforms, MUC4 and a glycoform of endorepellin) that can effectively distinguish a) patients with resectable PC patients from patients with benign pancreatic diseases; b) mucinous and non- mucinous cysts; c) high-grade from moderate- and low-grade mucinous cysts and d). high-risk intestinal type IPMNs and low risk gastric type IPMNs. The overall objective of this CVC proposal is to demonstrate the ability of the aforementioned biomarkers to distinguish pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PC) patients from healthy controls, patients with benign biliary obstruction and chronic pancreatitis (CP), and to identify those cysts with high malignant potential. We have a large number of high quality, well-characterized specimens from patients with pancreatic disease and diseased controls that were collected and processed following protocols developed through the EDRN. Two specific aims are proposed. Aim 1 will use available samples from our biospecimen repository to evaluate MUC5AC and MUC4 as biomarkers to distinguish pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PC) patients from healthy controls, and from patients with benign biliary obstruction and chronic pancreatitis (CP). Aim 2 will determine if our biomarkers can identify those cysts with high lethal potential from those with a low risk for malignant transformation."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This multidisciplinary effort of experts in biomarker research proposes to renew their commitment to the EDRN and to lead our Clinical Validation Center ever closer to impacting patient care. Therefore we propose to test best candidate biomarkers of lung cancer developed at our and other institutions for added value in the assessment of the risk for, and diagnosis of, lung cancer compared to the standard of care. The hypothesis is that addition of imaging and molecular biomarkers measured by chest computed tomography and in the sputum, the bronchial epithelium and blood, likely in a multivariable manner, could improve the identification of high risk individuals for lung cancer and improve CT screening overall results by reducing false-positive tests. We propose a three way approach. First we will test candidate biomarkers for lung cancer development in an observational study of selected very high risk individuals from the Nashville community performing repeated measurements of clinical, imaging (low-dose chest CT) variables, as well as molecular biomarker signatures, some of which will be obtained from bronchoscopy. Second, we propose to validate the most promising diagnostic candidate signatures to each test in carefully designed prospective study of individuals presenting with indeterminate pulmonary nodules. Third, we will test a novel molecular imaging tracer in a population of intermediate and high risk lung nodules. This tracer will be compared to standard of care FDG PET, and if significantly better, should have huge impact on the management of lung nodules. Our CVC will also centralize an effort to collect and store pertinent clinical data and tissues (blood, urine, and the airways specimens) and make these resources available to the community and to collaborators within and outside of the EDRN program, including the industry partners."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We hypothesize that early detection, targeting aggressive prostate cancer, will enable survival benefits of treatment for lethal disease, and reduce harms of over-treatment for indolent disease. Toward this goal, we assemble biospecimen sample sets via rigorous SOP's in cohorts designed to avoid bias. We provide these specimens and guidance regarding study design to Discovery Labs, industry and consortia. Team efforts between the DMCC, the Hopkins BRL, industry partners, UTHSC-SA and our CVC facilitated FDA approval of the Prostate Health Index (phi - with data from our CVC's first cycle), and urinary PCA3 (with data from the current cycle). In two funding cycles, our CVC enrolled 4,821 subjects. We helped advance the TMPRSS2:Erg fusion (T2:Erg) discovery by the Chinnaiyan BDL toward actionable clinical use, completing 3 Aims with progress on the 4th: First, we combined urinary detection of T2:Erg with urinary PCA3 to improve specificity of detecting cancers with Gleason score > 7, validated this algorithm in a multi-center cohort, and showed the potential to reduce health care cost via this algorithm in men less than 65 years old. Second, we characterized community-based distribution of urinary T2:Erg, PCA3, and phi independent of PSA screening, and found race- based differences in these parameters, paving the way for a phase IV screening trial (separate proposal under review by DOD). Third, we compared prostatectomy tissue Erg expression to urinary T2:Erg, guiding the range of appropriate urinary T2:Erg cut-points to reflect tissue status. Fourth, we procured biopsies from two nation- wide, retrospective watchful waiting cohorts (PHS and HPFS), enrolled subjects onto the PASS Trial, and assembled a biospecimen set suitable for evaluating multiplex RNA's to discern aggressive from indolent disease. Recognizing limitations of T2:Erg as a classifier of cancer aggressiveness, we initiated clinical translation of a 24-gene,
multiplex RNA panel for discerning aggressive from indolent prostate cancer; showed the feasibility of this assay in biopsy tissue and urine, and identified an industry partner to evaluat this signature on a clinical grade platform. We will expand our validation studies to include imaging to assess cancer severity based on FACBC, a PET radiotracer undergoing clinical development. We are expanding the breadth of our CVC from previously being limited to academic medical centers (AMC's), to now including an urban indigent care hospital, a Veterans Administration Medical Center, and a suburban community hospital (in addition to our host AMC) so that we project enrolling 1050 African-American men, substantially diversifying the EDRN biospecimen resource. We now propose the following Aims: 1) To validate the combination of urine PCA3, T2:Erg and serum phi as predictive of aggressive prostate cancer de novo and for active surveillance; 2) To validate a multiplex RNA signature of aggressive prostate cancer in biopsy samples and post-DRE urine; 3) To validate FACBC as imaging to detect occult metastatic disease in high-risk, localized prostate cancer; 4) To collaborate with EDRN BDL's, CVC's and BRL's to advance prostate cancer biomarker development."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Advances in cytoreductive surgery and combination chemotherapy have improved 5-year survival in patients with epithelial ovarian cancer, but the rate of cure remains essentially unchanged over the last two decades. Computer models suggest that detection of ovarian cancer in early stage (I-II) could improve rates of cure by 10-30%. Sequential use of serum biomarkers measured over time followed by TVS in a small fraction of postmenopausal women with rising CA125 has proven more specific and more sensitive than either modality used alone. Using this strategy, the United Kingdom Collaborative Trial for Ovarian Cancer Screening (UKCTOCS) and the Normal Risk Ovarian Cancer Screening Study (NROSS) in the United States have shown that only 3 operations are required to detect each case of ovarian cancer. Over the last 13 years, our group has conducted the NROSS study in 4,904 postmenopausal women at average risk for ovarian cancer. Annual determinations of CA125 have been analyzed by the Risk of Ovarian Cancer Algorithm (ROCA) developed by Dr. Skates. If the risk does not change, women return in a year; if it increases markedly, TVS is performed and participants are referred to a gynecologic oncologist; if the risk is intermediate CA125 is repeated in 3 months. Fifteen operations have been performed to detect 10 ovarian cancers. Two were borderline tumors and 8 were invasive with 8 of the 10 (80%) in Stage I or II. The NROSS trial has utilized a well-coordinated network of 7 sites in the United States where 22,981 blood samples have been obtained, processed and stored with standard operating protocols. Pre-operative specimens from MDACC have been banked from 502 women with ovarian cancer and 737 with benign disease. This has provided a valuable resource for evaluating new biomarkers. As CA125 is expressed by only 80% of epithelial ovarian cancers, additional biomarkers will be required to optimize sensitivity. Our group has found that HE4 and CA72.4 can detect 16% of the cases missed by CA125 in samples from the UKCTOCS trial. Autoantibodies to tumor associated antigens have shown even greater promise. Elevated levels of autoantibodies against TP53 have been found in 20-25% of patients with normal CA125 at the time of conventional diagnosis. Titers of anti-TP53 rise 13.5 months (mean) prior to CA125 and 33 months (mean) prior to diagnosis in patients who present without an increase in CA125. At present we are developing a new ROCA that incorporates CA125, HE4, CA72.4 and anti-TP53 autoantibody data. A multidisciplinary team of 27 investigators will pursue the following Specific Aims: 1) to conduct a screening trial to determine the specificity and positive predictive value for a 4 biomarker ROCA including CA125, HE4, CA72.4 and anti-TP53 autoantibodies in a two stage strategy for early detection of ovarian cancer in postmenopausal women at average risk for the disease; 2) to maintain and share a serum and plasma bank to facilitate evaluation of novel biomarkers for early detection; 3) to collaborate with other Centers in the EDRN to evaluate additional biomarkers for early detection of ovarian cancer."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There remain clear clinical and public health needs to improve the early detection of breast, colorectal, and ovary cancers. For breast and colorectal cancers effective, widely used screening tests exist, but for breast cancer there remain issues with respect to optimizing mammography's use and performance, and for colorectal cancer both limited access to and the invasiveness of colonoscopy are barriers to its wider use. Ovary cancer is less common but highly lethal, and no clinically useful tests for its early detection are
currently available. Through the current breast and ovary cancer EDRN Clinical Validation Center (CVC) led by Dr. Li and the current colorectal cancer EDRN Biomarker Development Laboratory (BDL) led by Dr. Lampe, we have discovered and validated promising sets of candidate early detection biomarkers for each of these three cancers that now warrant further Phase 2 and Phase 3 validation. We propose the following three projects: Project 1: Phase 3 validation of early detection biomarkers for ER+ breast cancer: Nine candidate biomarkers that have been preliminarily validated in preclinical samples will be assessed in an independent set of preclinical samples. Their intended clinical applications are to: 1. Inform timing of a subsequent mammogram in women with a negative screening mammogram; 2. Inform continuation of mammographic screening among women 75-79 years; 3. Prioritize women who should be screened with mammography in areas with limited resources. Project 2: Phase 3 validation of early detection biomarkers for colorectal cancer: We will validate five biomarkers that have been preliminarily validated in multiple sets of samples with performance that meets or exceeds those of existing fecal tests. Our intended clinical applications are to: 1. Identify people unwilling to undergo or with no access to colonoscopy who should be prioritized for colonoscopy (improve/replace existing FIT and Cologuard tests); 2. Among symptomatic patients identify those who have a very low risk of cancer and can avoid colonoscopy. Project 3: Phase 2 and 3 validation of auto- antibodies (AAb) as early detection biomarkers for serous ovarian cancer (SOC): Our overall goal is to combine novel AAb markers with currently available tests in a two-stage screening strategy with the potential to reduce ovarian cancer mortality. Our intended clinical applications are: 1. Use AAbs in conjunction with CA125 as a first line screening test; 2. Use AAbs in conjunction with HE4 for cancer early detection in women with rising CA125. In addition, we will serve as an EDRN collaborative resource providing biospecimens and expertise to support high quality PRoBE compliant EDRN discovery and validation studies across cancer types. With the combined expertise of our multidisciplinary team of investigators, this CVC will both lead well- justified, rigorously designed validation studies and provide abundant resources to EDRN. Given the strength of our biomarker candidates, the sets of biospecimens that will be used, the study designs employed, and the clearly delineated clinical applications proposed, we anticipate that this work will yield near-ter clinical impact."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to establish the Moffitt Imaging Biomarker Validation Center (MIBVAC) focused on imaging biomarker validations for early cancer detection and accurate risk assessments by leveraging our team of strong experts, resources, planned imaging biomarker validation studies, and analysis and network collaboration structures. In previous studies we have demonstrated that various measurements from breast images quantify breast cancer risk. The large cooperative National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) also showed a significant survival improvement for individuals screened by low dose CT compared to those screened with conventional radiography. Additionally, we have recently shown that CT image analysis (radiomics) can improve classification in this data set. However, due to difficulties in obtaining accurate and reproducible measurements and high false-positive rates of current imaging, cancer imaging biomarkers have not been routinely incorporated into clinical risk assessment. If these imaging biomarkers can be accurately tailored at the individual level, their impact will be significantly improved for early cancer detection and intervention. MIBVAC plans to achieve this challenging yet quite achievable goal by rigorously evaluating and validating these imaging biomarkers for rapid translation into clinical and practical applications. We have four specific aims: (Aim 1) Establish breast imaging resources for EDRN both with our existing and new case-control datasets of breast images and to evaluate and validate breast imaging biomarkers based on newly-established case-control dataset of digital breast tomosynthesis (TS) images, (Aim 2) Evaluate and validate lung imaging biomarkers for early detection of cancer first based on NLST low-dose CT (LDCT) cohorts and then expanding with a newly-established case-control cohort of higher resolution LDCT, (Aim 3) Conduct validation studies with imaging biomarkers for EDRN partners and others for other malignancies, and (Aim 4) Refine and validate imaging biomarkers analytically for early detection of breast, lung, and other cancers and to construct MIBVAC imaging data and specimen resources for EDRN collaborations and sharing."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Early detection of PDAC is an area of highest priority and an unmet need for advancing public health in the United States. Certain sub-groups of patients, such as those with mucinous pancreatic cysts are at higher risk for progression to PDAC, but even in these cohorts, there is potential for over-diagnosis, underscoring the need for biomarkers that can accurately distinguish aggressive versus indolent cysts. The long term goal of our EDRN Clinical Validation Center (CVC), comprised of MD Anderson (MDACC), University of Utah and Indiana University, is to implement a multi-institutional framework for collecting the highest quality biospecimens from patients with a variety of well-defined pancreatic pathologies in order to conduct biomarker validation studies for early detection of PDAC that conform to EDRN-defined Phase 2 and Phase 3 study design. Specifically, this CVC will prospectively recruit at least 600 patients with early stage (resected) PDAC, at least 300 patients with surgically resected pancreatic cystic lesions of varying histology and grades of dysplasia, at least 400 benign pancreatic diseases (including chronic pancreatitis, benign cysts, endocrine tumors of low malignant potential), at least 300 patients with non-resected pancreatic cystic lesions that have follow up of 2 years or greater without evidence for progression, and at least 300 control patients with non- pancreatic diseases, in order to obtain plasma and serum samples from these subjects for biomarker validation studies. Additionally, we will obtain cyst fluid samples from all patients with pancreatic cystic lesions, both surgically resected and those being followed by endoscopic imaging. In accordance with the EDRN principles, these biospecimens will be utilized in facilitating collaborations with other BDLs, for biomarker discovery and validation studies. Preliminary data generated in our CVC has identified a focused panel of overexpressed autoantibodies and antigens (ERBB2, TNC, ESR1, CACNA1D and CDKN2AIP) that significantly improves CA19-9 AUC in both diagnostic and pre-diagnostic cohorts. We will use a hybrid array platform developed at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC) that is capable of quantifying both antigens and autoantibodies from plasma, and use this platform to complete three PRoBE compliant biomarker studies: Study 1 will be an EDRN-defined Phase 3 study in pre-diagnostic PDAC samples (n=158) and matched controls (n=158) from WHI and PLCO cohorts, followed by an EDRN-defined Phase 2 case control study of early stage (resectable) PDAC (N = 300) versus chronic pancreatitis (N = 300) and non-pancreatic disease controls (N=300); Study 2 will be an EDRN-defined Phase 3 study in PLCO pre-diagnostic PDAC samples (n=160), and matched controls (n=160); and Study 3 will be an EDRN-defined Phase 2 case control study of pancreatic cystic neoplasms with high-grade dysplasia or cancer (N =150) versus pancreatic cystic neoplasms with surgically confirmed low-grade dysplasia and non-mucinous cystic lesions (N=150), as well as low-risk cyst with adequate follow up that are followed without surgery (N=150)."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We hypothesize that early detection, targeting aggressive prostate cancer, will enable survival benefits of treatment for lethal disease, and reduce harms of over-treatment for indolent disease. Toward this goal, we assemble biospecimen sample sets via rigorous SOP's in cohorts designed to avoid bias. We provide these specimens and guidance regarding study design to Discovery Labs, industry and consortia. Team efforts between the DMCC, the Hopkins BRL, industry partners, UTHSC-SA and our CVC facilitated FDA approval of the Prostate Health Index (phi - with data from our CVC's first cycle), and urinary PCA3 (with data from the current cycle). In two funding cycles, our CVC enrolled 4,821 subjects. We helped advance the TMPRSS2:Erg fusion (T2:Erg) discovery by the Chinnaiyan BDL toward actionable clinical use, completing 3 Aims with progress on the 4th: First, we combined urinary detection of T2:Erg with urinary PCA3 to improve specificity of detecting cancers with Gleason score > 7, validated this algorithm in a multi-center cohort, and showed the potential to reduce health care cost via this algorithm in men less than 65 years old. Second, we characterized community-based distribution of urinary T2:Erg, PCA3, and phi independent of PSA screening, and found race- based differences in these parameters, paving the way for a phase IV screening trial (separate proposal under review by DOD). Third, we compared prostatectomy tissue Erg expression to urinary T2:Erg, guiding the range of appropriate urinary T2:Erg cut-points to reflect tissue status. Fourth, we procured biopsies from two nation- wide, retrospective watchful waiting cohorts (PHS and HPFS), enrolled subjects onto the PASS Trial, and assembled a biospecimen set suitable for evaluating multiplex RNA's to discern aggressive from indolent disease. Recognizing limitations of T2:Erg as a classifier of cancer aggressiveness, we initiated clinical translation of a 24-gene,
multiplex RNA panel for discerning aggressive from indolent prostate cancer; showed the feasibility of this assay in biopsy tissue and urine, and identified an industry partner to evaluat this signature on a clinical grade platform. We will expand our validation studies to include imaging to assess cancer severity based on FACBC, a PET radiotracer undergoing clinical development. We are expanding the breadth of our CVC from previously being limited to academic medical centers (AMC's), to now including an urban indigent care hospital, a Veterans Administration Medical Center, and a suburban community hospital (in addition to our host AMC) so that we project enrolling 1050 African-American men, substantially diversifying the EDRN biospecimen resource. We now propose the following Aims: 1) To validate the combination of urine PCA3, T2:Erg and serum phi as predictive of aggressive prostate cancer de novo and for active surveillance; 2) To validate a multiplex RNA signature of aggressive prostate cancer in biopsy samples and post-DRE urine; 3) To validate FACBC as imaging to detect occult metastatic disease in high-risk, localized prostate cancer; 4) To collaborate with EDRN BDL's, CVC's and BRL's to advance prostate cancer biomarker development."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Continued support of the Great Lakes New England (GLNE) Clinical Validation Center (CVC) of the Early Detection Research Network (EDRN) via the U01 mechanism is requested. The GLNE CVC is a highly collaborative, multi-institutional consortium designed to develop, implement and analyze trials for the validation of biomarkers for the early detection of colorectal adenocarcinoma and other GI malignancies. Over the last 15 years, the GLNE has: 1. developed a high quality repository of samples collected from human subjects with colorectal, lower esophageal neoplasias, pancreatic neoplasms and controls; 2. collaborated with 9 biomarker developmental laboratories, 4 biomarker reference laboratories, the EDRN DMCC, and 9 industrial partners publishing 36 collaborative manuscripts; 3. Performed phase I validation trials of 26 biomarkers for the early detection of colorectal adenocarcinoma; 4. Initiated and recruited 5,154 participants to a Network-wide cross sectional validation trial of biomarkers for the early detection of colorectal cancer. The GLNE proposes to 1. Complete an ongoing prospective Phase 2 validation trial of vimentin methylation, serum galectin-3 ligand, BCAT1/IKZF1 methylation in plasma, fecal immunochemical tests (FIT), Exact Sciences stool DNA panel, or any future individual biomarker individually and as a panel for the early detection of colorectal neoplasia using colonoscopy as the gold standard; 2. To perform phase 1 validation trials (training and test set designs) of promising biomarkers discovered by EDRN Biomarker Validation Laboratories, external academic collaborating institutions, and collaborating EDRN industrial partners for the early detection of colorectal cancer, high grade colorectal dysplasia, and screen relevant colorectal neoplasms; 3. Assess the frequency of missed or occult colonic and upper gastrointestinal neoplasia in patients with initially normal colonoscopies and persistently positive stool DNA testing; and 4. Continue to expand and renew the archive of appropriately preserved stool, serum, plasma, urine, tissue and DNA biospecimens to be used by EDRN investigators for future validation and biomarker discovery research. These aims will be addressed by a multi-institutional consortium of university and community GI practices recruiting human subjects undergoing screening colonoscopy under a PRoBE compliant protocol. The data will be managed and analyzed by the EDRN data management and coordinating center."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This multidisciplinary effort of experts in biomarker research proposes to renew their commitment to the EDRN and to lead our Clinical Validation Center ever closer to impacting patient care. Therefore we propose to test best candidate biomarkers of lung cancer developed at our and other institutions for added value in the assessment of the risk for, and diagnosis of, lung cancer compared to the standard of care. The hypothesis is that addition of imaging and molecular biomarkers measured by chest computed tomography and in the sputum, the bronchial epithelium and blood, likely in a multivariable manner, could improve the identification of high risk individuals for lung cancer and improve CT screening overall results by reducing false-positive tests. We propose a three way approach. First we will test candidate biomarkers for lung cancer development in an observational study of selected very high risk individuals from the Nashville community performing repeated measurements of clinical, imaging (low-dose chest CT) variables, as well as molecular biomarker signatures, some of which will be obtained from bronchoscopy. Second, we propose to validate the most promising diagnostic candidate signatures to each test in carefully designed prospective study of individuals presenting with indeterminate pulmonary nodules. Third, we will test a novel molecular imaging tracer in a population of intermediate and high risk lung nodules. This tracer will be compared to standard of care FDG PET, and if significantly better, should have huge impact on the management of lung nodules. Our CVC will also centralize an effort to collect and store pertinent clinical data and tissues (blood, urine, and the airways specimens) and make these resources available to the community and to collaborators within and outside of the EDRN program, including the industry partners."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There remain clear clinical and public health needs to improve the early detection of breast, colorectal, and ovary cancers. For breast and colorectal cancers effective, widely used screening tests exist, but for breast cancer there remain issues with respect to optimizing mammography's use and performance, and for colorectal cancer both limited access to and the invasiveness of colonoscopy are barriers to its wider use. Ovary cancer is less common but highly lethal, and no clinically useful tests for its early detection are
currently available. Through the current breast and ovary cancer EDRN Clinical Validation Center (CVC) led by Dr. Li and the current colorectal cancer EDRN Biomarker Development Laboratory (BDL) led by Dr. Lampe, we have discovered and validated promising sets of candidate early detection biomarkers for each of these three cancers that now warrant further Phase 2 and Phase 3 validation. We propose the following three projects: Project 1: Phase 3 validation of early detection biomarkers for ER+ breast cancer: Nine candidate biomarkers that have been preliminarily validated in preclinical samples will be assessed in an independent set of preclinical samples. Their intended clinical applications are to: 1. Inform timing of a subsequent mammogram in women with a negative screening mammogram; 2. Inform continuation of mammographic screening among women 75-79 years; 3. Prioritize women who should be screened with mammography in areas with limited resources. Project 2: Phase 3 validation of early detection biomarkers for colorectal cancer: We will validate five biomarkers that have been preliminarily validated in multiple sets of samples with performance that meets or exceeds those of existing fecal tests. Our intended clinical applications are to: 1. Identify people unwilling to undergo or with no access to colonoscopy who should be prioritized for colonoscopy (improve/replace existing FIT and Cologuard tests); 2. Among symptomatic patients identify those who have a very low risk of cancer and can avoid colonoscopy. Project 3: Phase 2 and 3 validation of auto- antibodies (AAb) as early detection biomarkers for serous ovarian cancer (SOC): Our overall goal is to combine novel AAb markers with currently available tests in a two-stage screening strategy with the potential to reduce ovarian cancer mortality. Our intended clinical applications are: 1. Use AAbs in conjunction with CA125 as a first line screening test; 2. Use AAbs in conjunction with HE4 for cancer early detection in women with rising CA125. In addition, we will serve as an EDRN collaborative resource providing biospecimens and expertise to support high quality PRoBE compliant EDRN discovery and validation studies across cancer types. With the combined expertise of our multidisciplinary team of investigators, this CVC will both lead well- justified, rigorously designed validation studies and provide abundant resources to EDRN. Given the strength of our biomarker candidates, the sets of biospecimens that will be used, the study designs employed, and the clearly delineated clinical applications proposed, we anticipate that this work will yield near-ter clinical impact."

5U01CA200466-04	U01CA200466	9675242	2019	Validation of biomarkers for early diagnosis and risk prediction of pancreatic neoplasms	"﻿   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A majority of pancreatic cancer (PC) patients (> 80%) present with an unresectable primary tumor with distant metastasis at the time of diagnosis due to its asymptomatic nature and lack of methods for early detection. While the overall 5-year survival rate of PC is dismal, signiﬁcantly better outcomes have been reported for early stage smaller tumors. PC is believed to progress through a series of histological changes and recent estimates indicate that these changes require 15-20 years to develop into invasive metastatic disease, hence providing a window of opportunity to intervene. While early diagnosis is an obvious strategy to improve the survival of PC patients, lack of non-invasive biomarkers for risk prediction of precursor lesions or early stage invasive disease impedes our ability to diagnose PC during this ""window. Premalignant cystic lesions of the pancreas offer unique opportunity for early diagnosis. To meet the EDRN stated goal of performing a validation study for early cancer detection and risk assessment likely to yield meaningful results within 5 years, we propose an innovative approach that could lead to the development of a clinically useful biomarker in this time frame. Additionally, we propose to study cystic neoplasms since IPMN and MCN offer a unique opportunity to identify pancreatic premalignant lesions and serve as a target for early detection strategies. The candidate biomarkers studies in our application have been identified and evaluated over the past 5 years in EDRN-funded biomarker developmental laboratories (BDLs). Studies from the laboratories of participating investigators have conclusively established that mucin overexpression is a hallmark of pancreatic cancer and have identified biomarkers (MUC5AC and its 2 glycoforms, MUC4 and a glycoform of endorepellin) that can effectively distinguish a) patients with resectable PC patients from patients with benign pancreatic diseases; b) mucinous and non- mucinous cysts; c) high-grade from moderate- and low-grade mucinous cysts and d). high-risk intestinal type IPMNs and low risk gastric type IPMNs. The overall objective of this CVC proposal is to demonstrate the ability of the aforementioned biomarkers to distinguish pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PC) patients from healthy controls, patients with benign biliary obstruction and chronic pancreatitis (CP), and to identify those cysts with high malignant potential. We have a large number of high quality, well-characterized specimens from patients with pancreatic disease and diseased controls that were collected and processed following protocols developed through the EDRN. Two specific aims are proposed. Aim 1 will use available samples from our biospecimen repository to evaluate MUC5AC and MUC4 as biomarkers to distinguish pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PC) patients from healthy controls, and from patients with benign biliary obstruction and chronic pancreatitis (CP). Aim 2 will determine if our biomarkers can identify those cysts with high lethal potential from those with a low risk for malignant transformation."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to establish the Moffitt Imaging Biomarker Validation Center (MIBVAC) focused on imaging biomarker validations for early cancer detection and accurate risk assessments by leveraging our team of strong experts, resources, planned imaging biomarker validation studies, and analysis and network collaboration structures. In previous studies we have demonstrated that various measurements from breast images quantify breast cancer risk. The large cooperative National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) also showed a significant survival improvement for individuals screened by low dose CT compared to those screened with conventional radiography. Additionally, we have recently shown that CT image analysis (radiomics) can improve classification in this data set. However, due to difficulties in obtaining accurate and reproducible measurements and high false-positive rates of current imaging, cancer imaging biomarkers have not been routinely incorporated into clinical risk assessment. If these imaging biomarkers can be accurately tailored at the individual level, their impact will be significantly improved for early cancer detection and intervention. MIBVAC plans to achieve this challenging yet quite achievable goal by rigorously evaluating and validating these imaging biomarkers for rapid translation into clinical and practical applications. We have four specific aims: (Aim 1) Establish breast imaging resources for EDRN both with our existing and new case-control datasets of breast images and to evaluate and validate breast imaging biomarkers based on newly-established case-control dataset of digital breast tomosynthesis (TS) images, (Aim 2) Evaluate and validate lung imaging biomarkers for early detection of cancer first based on NLST low-dose CT (LDCT) cohorts and then expanding with a newly-established case-control cohort of higher resolution LDCT, (Aim 3) Conduct validation studies with imaging biomarkers for EDRN partners and others for other malignancies, and (Aim 4) Refine and validate imaging biomarkers analytically for early detection of breast, lung, and other cancers and to construct MIBVAC imaging data and specimen resources for EDRN collaborations and sharing."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Advances in cytoreductive surgery and combination chemotherapy have improved 5-year survival in patients with epithelial ovarian cancer, but the rate of cure remains essentially unchanged over the last two decades. Computer models suggest that detection of ovarian cancer in early stage (I-II) could improve rates of cure by 10-30%. Sequential use of serum biomarkers measured over time followed by TVS in a small fraction of postmenopausal women with rising CA125 has proven more specific and more sensitive than either modality used alone. Using this strategy, the United Kingdom Collaborative Trial for Ovarian Cancer Screening (UKCTOCS) and the Normal Risk Ovarian Cancer Screening Study (NROSS) in the United States have shown that only 3 operations are required to detect each case of ovarian cancer. Over the last 13 years, our group has conducted the NROSS study in 4,904 postmenopausal women at average risk for ovarian cancer. Annual determinations of CA125 have been analyzed by the Risk of Ovarian Cancer Algorithm (ROCA) developed by Dr. Skates. If the risk does not change, women return in a year; if it increases markedly, TVS is performed and participants are referred to a gynecologic oncologist; if the risk is intermediate CA125 is repeated in 3 months. Fifteen operations have been performed to detect 10 ovarian cancers. Two were borderline tumors and 8 were invasive with 8 of the 10 (80%) in Stage I or II. The NROSS trial has utilized a well-coordinated network of 7 sites in the United States where 22,981 blood samples have been obtained, processed and stored with standard operating protocols. Pre-operative specimens from MDACC have been banked from 502 women with ovarian cancer and 737 with benign disease. This has provided a valuable resource for evaluating new biomarkers. As CA125 is expressed by only 80% of epithelial ovarian cancers, additional biomarkers will be required to optimize sensitivity. Our group has found that HE4 and CA72.4 can detect 16% of the cases missed by CA125 in samples from the UKCTOCS trial. Autoantibodies to tumor associated antigens have shown even greater promise. Elevated levels of autoantibodies against TP53 have been found in 20-25% of patients with normal CA125 at the time of conventional diagnosis. Titers of anti-TP53 rise 13.5 months (mean) prior to CA125 and 33 months (mean) prior to diagnosis in patients who present without an increase in CA125. At present we are developing a new ROCA that incorporates CA125, HE4, CA72.4 and anti-TP53 autoantibody data. A multidisciplinary team of 27 investigators will pursue the following Specific Aims: 1) to conduct a screening trial to determine the specificity and positive predictive value for a 4 biomarker ROCA including CA125, HE4, CA72.4 and anti-TP53 autoantibodies in a two stage strategy for early detection of ovarian cancer in postmenopausal women at average risk for the disease; 2) to maintain and share a serum and plasma bank to facilitate evaluation of novel biomarkers for early detection; 3) to collaborate with other Centers in the EDRN to evaluate additional biomarkers for early detection of ovarian cancer."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Early detection of PDAC is an area of highest priority and an unmet need for advancing public health in the United States. Certain sub-groups of patients, such as those with mucinous pancreatic cysts are at higher risk for progression to PDAC, but even in these cohorts, there is potential for over-diagnosis, underscoring the need for biomarkers that can accurately distinguish aggressive versus indolent cysts. The long term goal of our EDRN Clinical Validation Center (CVC), comprised of MD Anderson (MDACC), University of Utah and Indiana University, is to implement a multi-institutional framework for collecting the highest quality biospecimens from patients with a variety of well-defined pancreatic pathologies in order to conduct biomarker validation studies for early detection of PDAC that conform to EDRN-defined Phase 2 and Phase 3 study design. Specifically, this CVC will prospectively recruit at least 600 patients with early stage (resected) PDAC, at least 300 patients with surgically resected pancreatic cystic lesions of varying histology and grades of dysplasia, at least 400 benign pancreatic diseases (including chronic pancreatitis, benign cysts, endocrine tumors of low malignant potential), at least 300 patients with non-resected pancreatic cystic lesions that have follow up of 2 years or greater without evidence for progression, and at least 300 control patients with non- pancreatic diseases, in order to obtain plasma and serum samples from these subjects for biomarker validation studies. Additionally, we will obtain cyst fluid samples from all patients with pancreatic cystic lesions, both surgically resected and those being followed by endoscopic imaging. In accordance with the EDRN principles, these biospecimens will be utilized in facilitating collaborations with other BDLs, for biomarker discovery and validation studies. Preliminary data generated in our CVC has identified a focused panel of overexpressed autoantibodies and antigens (ERBB2, TNC, ESR1, CACNA1D and CDKN2AIP) that significantly improves CA19-9 AUC in both diagnostic and pre-diagnostic cohorts. We will use a hybrid array platform developed at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC) that is capable of quantifying both antigens and autoantibodies from plasma, and use this platform to complete three PRoBE compliant biomarker studies: Study 1 will be an EDRN-defined Phase 3 study in pre-diagnostic PDAC samples (n=158) and matched controls (n=158) from WHI and PLCO cohorts, followed by an EDRN-defined Phase 2 case control study of early stage (resectable) PDAC (N = 300) versus chronic pancreatitis (N = 300) and non-pancreatic disease controls (N=300); Study 2 will be an EDRN-defined Phase 3 study in PLCO pre-diagnostic PDAC samples (n=160), and matched controls (n=160); and Study 3 will be an EDRN-defined Phase 2 case control study of pancreatic cystic neoplasms with high-grade dysplasia or cancer (N =150) versus pancreatic cystic neoplasms with surgically confirmed low-grade dysplasia and non-mucinous cystic lesions (N=150), as well as low-risk cyst with adequate follow up that are followed without surgery (N=150)."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There remain clear clinical and public health needs to improve the early detection of breast, colorectal, and ovary cancers. For breast and colorectal cancers effective, widely used screening tests exist, but for breast cancer there remain issues with respect to optimizing mammography's use and performance, and for colorectal cancer both limited access to and the invasiveness of colonoscopy are barriers to its wider use. Ovary cancer is less common but highly lethal, and no clinically useful tests for its early detection are
currently available. Through the current breast and ovary cancer EDRN Clinical Validation Center (CVC) led by Dr. Li and the current colorectal cancer EDRN Biomarker Development Laboratory (BDL) led by Dr. Lampe, we have discovered and validated promising sets of candidate early detection biomarkers for each of these three cancers that now warrant further Phase 2 and Phase 3 validation. We propose the following three projects: Project 1: Phase 3 validation of early detection biomarkers for ER+ breast cancer: Nine candidate biomarkers that have been preliminarily validated in preclinical samples will be assessed in an independent set of preclinical samples. Their intended clinical applications are to: 1. Inform timing of a subsequent mammogram in women with a negative screening mammogram; 2. Inform continuation of mammographic screening among women 75-79 years; 3. Prioritize women who should be screened with mammography in areas with limited resources. Project 2: Phase 3 validation of early detection biomarkers for colorectal cancer: We will validate five biomarkers that have been preliminarily validated in multiple sets of samples with performance that meets or exceeds those of existing fecal tests. Our intended clinical applications are to: 1. Identify people unwilling to undergo or with no access to colonoscopy who should be prioritized for colonoscopy (improve/replace existing FIT and Cologuard tests); 2. Among symptomatic patients identify those who have a very low risk of cancer and can avoid colonoscopy. Project 3: Phase 2 and 3 validation of auto- antibodies (AAb) as early detection biomarkers for serous ovarian cancer (SOC): Our overall goal is to combine novel AAb markers with currently available tests in a two-stage screening strategy with the potential to reduce ovarian cancer mortality. Our intended clinical applications are: 1. Use AAbs in conjunction with CA125 as a first line screening test; 2. Use AAbs in conjunction with HE4 for cancer early detection in women with rising CA125. In addition, we will serve as an EDRN collaborative resource providing biospecimens and expertise to support high quality PRoBE compliant EDRN discovery and validation studies across cancer types. With the combined expertise of our multidisciplinary team of investigators, this CVC will both lead well- justified, rigorously designed validation studies and provide abundant resources to EDRN. Given the strength of our biomarker candidates, the sets of biospecimens that will be used, the study designs employed, and the clearly delineated clinical applications proposed, we anticipate that this work will yield near-ter clinical impact."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We hypothesize that early detection, targeting aggressive prostate cancer, will enable survival benefits of treatment for lethal disease, and reduce harms of over-treatment for indolent disease. Toward this goal, we assemble biospecimen sample sets via rigorous SOP's in cohorts designed to avoid bias. We provide these specimens and guidance regarding study design to Discovery Labs, industry and consortia. Team efforts between the DMCC, the Hopkins BRL, industry partners, UTHSC-SA and our CVC facilitated FDA approval of the Prostate Health Index (phi - with data from our CVC's first cycle), and urinary PCA3 (with data from the current cycle). In two funding cycles, our CVC enrolled 4,821 subjects. We helped advance the TMPRSS2:Erg fusion (T2:Erg) discovery by the Chinnaiyan BDL toward actionable clinical use, completing 3 Aims with progress on the 4th: First, we combined urinary detection of T2:Erg with urinary PCA3 to improve specificity of detecting cancers with Gleason score > 7, validated this algorithm in a multi-center cohort, and showed the potential to reduce health care cost via this algorithm in men less than 65 years old. Second, we characterized community-based distribution of urinary T2:Erg, PCA3, and phi independent of PSA screening, and found race- based differences in these parameters, paving the way for a phase IV screening trial (separate proposal under review by DOD). Third, we compared prostatectomy tissue Erg expression to urinary T2:Erg, guiding the range of appropriate urinary T2:Erg cut-points to reflect tissue status. Fourth, we procured biopsies from two nation- wide, retrospective watchful waiting cohorts (PHS and HPFS), enrolled subjects onto the PASS Trial, and assembled a biospecimen set suitable for evaluating multiplex RNA's to discern aggressive from indolent disease. Recognizing limitations of T2:Erg as a classifier of cancer aggressiveness, we initiated clinical translation of a 24-gene,
multiplex RNA panel for discerning aggressive from indolent prostate cancer; showed the feasibility of this assay in biopsy tissue and urine, and identified an industry partner to evaluat this signature on a clinical grade platform. We will expand our validation studies to include imaging to assess cancer severity based on FACBC, a PET radiotracer undergoing clinical development. We are expanding the breadth of our CVC from previously being limited to academic medical centers (AMC's), to now including an urban indigent care hospital, a Veterans Administration Medical Center, and a suburban community hospital (in addition to our host AMC) so that we project enrolling 1050 African-American men, substantially diversifying the EDRN biospecimen resource. We now propose the following Aims: 1) To validate the combination of urine PCA3, T2:Erg and serum phi as predictive of aggressive prostate cancer de novo and for active surveillance; 2) To validate a multiplex RNA signature of aggressive prostate cancer in biopsy samples and post-DRE urine; 3) To validate FACBC as imaging to detect occult metastatic disease in high-risk, localized prostate cancer; 4) To collaborate with EDRN BDL's, CVC's and BRL's to advance prostate cancer biomarker development."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Advances in cytoreductive surgery and combination chemotherapy have improved 5-year survival in patients with epithelial ovarian cancer, but the rate of cure remains essentially unchanged over the last two decades. Computer models suggest that detection of ovarian cancer in early stage (I-II) could improve rates of cure by 10-30%. Sequential use of serum biomarkers measured over time followed by TVS in a small fraction of postmenopausal women with rising CA125 has proven more specific and more sensitive than either modality used alone. Using this strategy, the United Kingdom Collaborative Trial for Ovarian Cancer Screening (UKCTOCS) and the Normal Risk Ovarian Cancer Screening Study (NROSS) in the United States have shown that only 3 operations are required to detect each case of ovarian cancer. Over the last 13 years, our group has conducted the NROSS study in 4,904 postmenopausal women at average risk for ovarian cancer. Annual determinations of CA125 have been analyzed by the Risk of Ovarian Cancer Algorithm (ROCA) developed by Dr. Skates. If the risk does not change, women return in a year; if it increases markedly, TVS is performed and participants are referred to a gynecologic oncologist; if the risk is intermediate CA125 is repeated in 3 months. Fifteen operations have been performed to detect 10 ovarian cancers. Two were borderline tumors and 8 were invasive with 8 of the 10 (80%) in Stage I or II. The NROSS trial has utilized a well-coordinated network of 7 sites in the United States where 22,981 blood samples have been obtained, processed and stored with standard operating protocols. Pre-operative specimens from MDACC have been banked from 502 women with ovarian cancer and 737 with benign disease. This has provided a valuable resource for evaluating new biomarkers. As CA125 is expressed by only 80% of epithelial ovarian cancers, additional biomarkers will be required to optimize sensitivity. Our group has found that HE4 and CA72.4 can detect 16% of the cases missed by CA125 in samples from the UKCTOCS trial. Autoantibodies to tumor associated antigens have shown even greater promise. Elevated levels of autoantibodies against TP53 have been found in 20-25% of patients with normal CA125 at the time of conventional diagnosis. Titers of anti-TP53 rise 13.5 months (mean) prior to CA125 and 33 months (mean) prior to diagnosis in patients who present without an increase in CA125. At present we are developing a new ROCA that incorporates CA125, HE4, CA72.4 and anti-TP53 autoantibody data. A multidisciplinary team of 27 investigators will pursue the following Specific Aims: 1) to conduct a screening trial to determine the specificity and positive predictive value for a 4 biomarker ROCA including CA125, HE4, CA72.4 and anti-TP53 autoantibodies in a two stage strategy for early detection of ovarian cancer in postmenopausal women at average risk for the disease; 2) to maintain and share a serum and plasma bank to facilitate evaluation of novel biomarkers for early detection; 3) to collaborate with other Centers in the EDRN to evaluate additional biomarkers for early detection of ovarian cancer."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to establish the Moffitt Imaging Biomarker Validation Center (MIBVAC) focused on imaging biomarker validations for early cancer detection and accurate risk assessments by leveraging our team of strong experts, resources, planned imaging biomarker validation studies, and analysis and network collaboration structures. In previous studies we have demonstrated that various measurements from breast images quantify breast cancer risk. The large cooperative National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) also showed a significant survival improvement for individuals screened by low dose CT compared to those screened with conventional radiography. Additionally, we have recently shown that CT image analysis (radiomics) can improve classification in this data set. However, due to difficulties in obtaining accurate and reproducible measurements and high false-positive rates of current imaging, cancer imaging biomarkers have not been routinely incorporated into clinical risk assessment. If these imaging biomarkers can be accurately tailored at the individual level, their impact will be significantly improved for early cancer detection and intervention. MIBVAC plans to achieve this challenging yet quite achievable goal by rigorously evaluating and validating these imaging biomarkers for rapid translation into clinical and practical applications. We have four specific aims: (Aim 1) Establish breast imaging resources for EDRN both with our existing and new case-control datasets of breast images and to evaluate and validate breast imaging biomarkers based on newly-established case-control dataset of digital breast tomosynthesis (TS) images, (Aim 2) Evaluate and validate lung imaging biomarkers for early detection of cancer first based on NLST low-dose CT (LDCT) cohorts and then expanding with a newly-established case-control cohort of higher resolution LDCT, (Aim 3) Conduct validation studies with imaging biomarkers for EDRN partners and others for other malignancies, and (Aim 4) Refine and validate imaging biomarkers analytically for early detection of breast, lung, and other cancers and to construct MIBVAC imaging data and specimen resources for EDRN collaborations and sharing."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This multidisciplinary effort of experts in biomarker research proposes to renew their commitment to the EDRN and to lead our Clinical Validation Center ever closer to impacting patient care. Therefore we propose to test best candidate biomarkers of lung cancer developed at our and other institutions for added value in the assessment of the risk for, and diagnosis of, lung cancer compared to the standard of care. The hypothesis is that addition of imaging and molecular biomarkers measured by chest computed tomography and in the sputum, the bronchial epithelium and blood, likely in a multivariable manner, could improve the identification of high risk individuals for lung cancer and improve CT screening overall results by reducing false-positive tests. We propose a three way approach. First we will test candidate biomarkers for lung cancer development in an observational study of selected very high risk individuals from the Nashville community performing repeated measurements of clinical, imaging (low-dose chest CT) variables, as well as molecular biomarker signatures, some of which will be obtained from bronchoscopy. Second, we propose to validate the most promising diagnostic candidate signatures to each test in carefully designed prospective study of individuals presenting with indeterminate pulmonary nodules. Third, we will test a novel molecular imaging tracer in a population of intermediate and high risk lung nodules. This tracer will be compared to standard of care FDG PET, and if significantly better, should have huge impact on the management of lung nodules. Our CVC will also centralize an effort to collect and store pertinent clinical data and tissues (blood, urine, and the airways specimens) and make these resources available to the community and to collaborators within and outside of the EDRN program, including the industry partners."

5U01CA200466-03	U01CA200466	9458718	2018	Validation of biomarkers for early diagnosis and risk prediction of pancreatic neoplasms	"﻿   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A majority of pancreatic cancer (PC) patients (> 80%) present with an unresectable primary tumor with distant metastasis at the time of diagnosis due to its asymptomatic nature and lack of methods for early detection. While the overall 5-year survival rate of PC is dismal, signiﬁcantly better outcomes have been reported for early stage smaller tumors. PC is believed to progress through a series of histological changes and recent estimates indicate that these changes require 15-20 years to develop into invasive metastatic disease, hence providing a window of opportunity to intervene. While early diagnosis is an obvious strategy to improve the survival of PC patients, lack of non-invasive biomarkers for risk prediction of precursor lesions or early stage invasive disease impedes our ability to diagnose PC during this ""window. Premalignant cystic lesions of the pancreas offer unique opportunity for early diagnosis. To meet the EDRN stated goal of performing a validation study for early cancer detection and risk assessment likely to yield meaningful results within 5 years, we propose an innovative approach that could lead to the development of a clinically useful biomarker in this time frame. Additionally, we propose to study cystic neoplasms since IPMN and MCN offer a unique opportunity to identify pancreatic premalignant lesions and serve as a target for early detection strategies. The candidate biomarkers studies in our application have been identified and evaluated over the past 5 years in EDRN-funded biomarker developmental laboratories (BDLs). Studies from the laboratories of participating investigators have conclusively established that mucin overexpression is a hallmark of pancreatic cancer and have identified biomarkers (MUC5AC and its 2 glycoforms, MUC4 and a glycoform of endorepellin) that can effectively distinguish a) patients with resectable PC patients from patients with benign pancreatic diseases; b) mucinous and non- mucinous cysts; c) high-grade from moderate- and low-grade mucinous cysts and d). high-risk intestinal type IPMNs and low risk gastric type IPMNs. The overall objective of this CVC proposal is to demonstrate the ability of the aforementioned biomarkers to distinguish pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PC) patients from healthy controls, patients with benign biliary obstruction and chronic pancreatitis (CP), and to identify those cysts with high malignant potential. We have a large number of high quality, well-characterized specimens from patients with pancreatic disease and diseased controls that were collected and processed following protocols developed through the EDRN. Two specific aims are proposed. Aim 1 will use available samples from our biospecimen repository to evaluate MUC5AC and MUC4 as biomarkers to distinguish pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PC) patients from healthy controls, and from patients with benign biliary obstruction and chronic pancreatitis (CP). Aim 2 will determine if our biomarkers can identify those cysts with high lethal potential from those with a low risk for malignant transformation."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prostate cancer is the most common non-cutaneous cancer in American men. In May of 2012, the U.S. Preventive Task Force recommended that serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) screening no longer be recommended as standard clinical practice. A factor contributing to this recommendation is that many prostate cancers diagnosed via PSA-screening are indolent disease that will never progress. Current American Urologic Association recommendations stress informed decision making. To this end, this Clinical Validation Center will address the following major unmet clinical needs: 1) Optimize serum PSA screening protocols to identify men with aggressive diseases and reduce screening and detection of men with low risk disease (aim 1); 2) Validate markers that distinguish indolent versus aggressive disease using serum, DNA, urine, and tissue markers (aims 1 and 2); 3) Enhancing risk assessment for informed decision for individual patients, improving their ability to
determine if a biopsy is in their best interest; 4) Develop a risk assessment tool for men on active surveillance to assist patients and physicians with decision making regarding biopsy. The SABOR EDRN Clinical Validation Center, established in 2000, has a long history of development of new tests for prostate cancer and critically evaluating such tests to ensure that, if they are used in the clinic, patients benefit from their use. Using the 4000-man SABOR cohort with other established cohorts (e.g., SWOG PCPT and PASS), Phase II and III validation studies will be conducted to improve biomarker performance related to prostate cancer risk and long term disease outcomes. The first aim focuses on assessing long term performance of current biomarkers including PHI, PCA3 and TMPRSS2:ERG. Also proposed in this aim are validation studies of constitutional genetic variants that may identify men at greater cancer risk or who are more likely to have poor disease outcomes. In aim 2, tissue microarrays (TMAs) will be developed for validating published markers of prognosis. In addition, TMAs that allow evaluation of performance of new tissue-based markers in ethnical/racial diverse tumors will be constructed. For the third aim, the PCPT risk calculator will be refined and a new tool developed to help men on active surveillance determine if a surveillance biopsy is necessary. The Center will continue its work to provide carefully-collected samples from patients to other investigators to either help discover the tests of the future or to conduct studies to ensure that the tests trul help patients. In addition, the SABOR scientific personnel will continue to provide service in leadership positions of the EDRN to ensure that the entire Network accelerates toward the goal of successful early detection and cure of cancer."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We hypothesize that early detection, targeting aggressive prostate cancer, will enable survival benefits of treatment for lethal disease, and reduce harms of over-treatment for indolent disease. Toward this goal, we assemble biospecimen sample sets via rigorous SOP's in cohorts designed to avoid bias. We provide these specimens and guidance regarding study design to Discovery Labs, industry and consortia. Team efforts between the DMCC, the Hopkins BRL, industry partners, UTHSC-SA and our CVC facilitated FDA approval of the Prostate Health Index (phi - with data from our CVC's first cycle), and urinary PCA3 (with data from the current cycle). In two funding cycles, our CVC enrolled 4,821 subjects. We helped advance the TMPRSS2:Erg fusion (T2:Erg) discovery by the Chinnaiyan BDL toward actionable clinical use, completing 3 Aims with progress on the 4th: First, we combined urinary detection of T2:Erg with urinary PCA3 to improve specificity of detecting cancers with Gleason score > 7, validated this algorithm in a multi-center cohort, and showed the potential to reduce health care cost via this algorithm in men less than 65 years old. Second, we characterized community-based distribution of urinary T2:Erg, PCA3, and phi independent of PSA screening, and found race- based differences in these parameters, paving the way for a phase IV screening trial (separate proposal under review by DOD). Third, we compared prostatectomy tissue Erg expression to urinary T2:Erg, guiding the range of appropriate urinary T2:Erg cut-points to reflect tissue status. Fourth, we procured biopsies from two nation- wide, retrospective watchful waiting cohorts (PHS and HPFS), enrolled subjects onto the PASS Trial, and assembled a biospecimen set suitable for evaluating multiplex RNA's to discern aggressive from indolent disease. Recognizing limitations of T2:Erg as a classifier of cancer aggressiveness, we initiated clinical translation of a 24-gene,
multiplex RNA panel for discerning aggressive from indolent prostate cancer; showed the feasibility of this assay in biopsy tissue and urine, and identified an industry partner to evaluat this signature on a clinical grade platform. We will expand our validation studies to include imaging to assess cancer severity based on FACBC, a PET radiotracer undergoing clinical development. We are expanding the breadth of our CVC from previously being limited to academic medical centers (AMC's), to now including an urban indigent care hospital, a Veterans Administration Medical Center, and a suburban community hospital (in addition to our host AMC) so that we project enrolling 1050 African-American men, substantially diversifying the EDRN biospecimen resource. We now propose the following Aims: 1) To validate the combination of urine PCA3, T2:Erg and serum phi as predictive of aggressive prostate cancer de novo and for active surveillance; 2) To validate a multiplex RNA signature of aggressive prostate cancer in biopsy samples and post-DRE urine; 3) To validate FACBC as imaging to detect occult metastatic disease in high-risk, localized prostate cancer; 4) To collaborate with EDRN BDL's, CVC's and BRL's to advance prostate cancer biomarker development."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Advances in cytoreductive surgery and combination chemotherapy have improved 5-year survival in patients with epithelial ovarian cancer, but the rate of cure remains essentially unchanged over the last two decades. Computer models suggest that detection of ovarian cancer in early stage (I-II) could improve rates of cure by 10-30%. Sequential use of serum biomarkers measured over time followed by TVS in a small fraction of postmenopausal women with rising CA125 has proven more specific and more sensitive than either modality used alone. Using this strategy, the United Kingdom Collaborative Trial for Ovarian Cancer Screening (UKCTOCS) and the Normal Risk Ovarian Cancer Screening Study (NROSS) in the United States have shown that only 3 operations are required to detect each case of ovarian cancer. Over the last 13 years, our group has conducted the NROSS study in 4,904 postmenopausal women at average risk for ovarian cancer. Annual determinations of CA125 have been analyzed by the Risk of Ovarian Cancer Algorithm (ROCA) developed by Dr. Skates. If the risk does not change, women return in a year; if it increases markedly, TVS is performed and participants are referred to a gynecologic oncologist; if the risk is intermediate CA125 is repeated in 3 months. Fifteen operations have been performed to detect 10 ovarian cancers. Two were borderline tumors and 8 were invasive with 8 of the 10 (80%) in Stage I or II. The NROSS trial has utilized a well-coordinated network of 7 sites in the United States where 22,981 blood samples have been obtained, processed and stored with standard operating protocols. Pre-operative specimens from MDACC have been banked from 502 women with ovarian cancer and 737 with benign disease. This has provided a valuable resource for evaluating new biomarkers. As CA125 is expressed by only 80% of epithelial ovarian cancers, additional biomarkers will be required to optimize sensitivity. Our group has found that HE4 and CA72.4 can detect 16% of the cases missed by CA125 in samples from the UKCTOCS trial. Autoantibodies to tumor associated antigens have shown even greater promise. Elevated levels of autoantibodies against TP53 have been found in 20-25% of patients with normal CA125 at the time of conventional diagnosis. Titers of anti-TP53 rise 13.5 months (mean) prior to CA125 and 33 months (mean) prior to diagnosis in patients who present without an increase in CA125. At present we are developing a new ROCA that incorporates CA125, HE4, CA72.4 and anti-TP53 autoantibody data. A multidisciplinary team of 27 investigators will pursue the following Specific Aims: 1) to conduct a screening trial to determine the specificity and positive predictive value for a 4 biomarker ROCA including CA125, HE4, CA72.4 and anti-TP53 autoantibodies in a two stage strategy for early detection of ovarian cancer in postmenopausal women at average risk for the disease; 2) to maintain and share a serum and plasma bank to facilitate evaluation of novel biomarkers for early detection; 3) to collaborate with other Centers in the EDRN to evaluate additional biomarkers for early detection of ovarian cancer.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Continued support of the Great Lakes New England (GLNE) Clinical Validation Center (CVC) of the Early Detection Research Network (EDRN) via the U01 mechanism is requested. The GLNE CVC is a highly collaborative, multi-institutional consortium designed to develop, implement and analyze trials for the validation of biomarkers for the early detection of colorectal adenocarcinoma and other GI malignancies. Over the last 15 years, the GLNE has: 1. developed a high quality repository of samples collected from human subjects with colorectal, lower esophageal neoplasias, pancreatic neoplasms and controls; 2. collaborated with 9 biomarker developmental laboratories, 4 biomarker reference laboratories, the EDRN DMCC, and 9 industrial partners publishing 36 collaborative manuscripts; 3. Performed phase I validation trials of 26 biomarkers for the early detection of colorectal adenocarcinoma; 4. Initiated and recruited 5,154 participants to a Network-wide cross sectional validation trial of biomarkers for the early detection of colorectal cancer. The GLNE proposes to 1. Complete an ongoing prospective Phase 2 validation trial of vimentin methylation, serum galectin-3 ligand, BCAT1/IKZF1 methylation in plasma, fecal immunochemical tests (FIT), Exact Sciences stool DNA panel, or any future individual biomarker individually and as a panel for the early detection of colorectal neoplasia using colonoscopy as the gold standard; 2. To perform phase 1 validation trials (training and test set designs) of promising biomarkers discovered by EDRN Biomarker Validation Laboratories, external academic collaborating institutions, and collaborating EDRN industrial partners for the early detection of colorectal cancer, high grade colorectal dysplasia, and screen relevant colorectal neoplasms; 3. Assess the frequency of missed or occult colonic and upper gastrointestinal neoplasia in patients with initially normal colonoscopies and persistently positive stool DNA testing; and 4. Continue to expand and renew the archive of appropriately preserved stool, serum, plasma, urine, tissue and DNA biospecimens to be used by EDRN investigators for future validation and biomarker discovery research. These aims will be addressed by a multi-institutional consortium of university and community GI practices recruiting human subjects undergoing screening colonoscopy under a PRoBE compliant protocol. The data will be managed and analyzed by the EDRN data management and coordinating center."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There remain clear clinical and public health needs to improve the early detection of breast, colorectal, and ovary cancers. For breast and colorectal cancers effective, widely used screening tests exist, but for breast cancer there remain issues with respect to optimizing mammography's use and performance, and for colorectal cancer both limited access to and the invasiveness of colonoscopy are barriers to its wider use. Ovary cancer is less common but highly lethal, and no clinically useful tests for its early detection are
currently available. Through the current breast and ovary cancer EDRN Clinical Validation Center (CVC) led by Dr. Li and the current colorectal cancer EDRN Biomarker Development Laboratory (BDL) led by Dr. Lampe, we have discovered and validated promising sets of candidate early detection biomarkers for each of these three cancers that now warrant further Phase 2 and Phase 3 validation. We propose the following three projects: Project 1: Phase 3 validation of early detection biomarkers for ER+ breast cancer: Nine candidate biomarkers that have been preliminarily validated in preclinical samples will be assessed in an independent set of preclinical samples. Their intended clinical applications are to: 1. Inform timing of a subsequent mammogram in women with a negative screening mammogram; 2. Inform continuation of mammographic screening among women 75-79 years; 3. Prioritize women who should be screened with mammography in areas with limited resources. Project 2: Phase 3 validation of early detection biomarkers for colorectal cancer: We will validate five biomarkers that have been preliminarily validated in multiple sets of samples with performance that meets or exceeds those of existing fecal tests. Our intended clinical applications are to: 1. Identify people unwilling to undergo or with no access to colonoscopy who should be prioritized for colonoscopy (improve/replace existing FIT and Cologuard tests); 2. Among symptomatic patients identify those who have a very low risk of cancer and can avoid colonoscopy. Project 3: Phase 2 and 3 validation of auto- antibodies (AAb) as early detection biomarkers for serous ovarian cancer (SOC): Our overall goal is to combine novel AAb markers with currently available tests in a two-stage screening strategy with the potential to reduce ovarian cancer mortality. Our intended clinical applications are: 1. Use AAbs in conjunction with CA125 as a first line screening test; 2. Use AAbs in conjunction with HE4 for cancer early detection in women with rising CA125. In addition, we will serve as an EDRN collaborative resource providing biospecimens and expertise to support high quality PRoBE compliant EDRN discovery and validation studies across cancer types. With the combined expertise of our multidisciplinary team of investigators, this CVC will both lead well- justified, rigorously designed validation studies and provide abundant resources to EDRN. Given the strength of our biomarker candidates, the sets of biospecimens that will be used, the study designs employed, and the clearly delineated clinical applications proposed, we anticipate that this work will yield near-ter clinical impact."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prostate cancer is the most common non-cutaneous cancer in American men. In May of 2012, the U.S. Preventive Task Force recommended that serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) screening no longer be recommended as standard clinical practice. A factor contributing to this recommendation is that many prostate cancers diagnosed via PSA-screening are indolent disease that will never progress. Current American Urologic Association recommendations stress informed decision making. To this end, this Clinical Validation Center will address the following major unmet clinical needs: 1) Optimize serum PSA screening protocols to identify men with aggressive diseases and reduce screening and detection of men with low risk disease (aim 1); 2) Validate markers that distinguish indolent versus aggressive disease using serum, DNA, urine, and tissue markers (aims 1 and 2); 3) Enhancing risk assessment for informed decision for individual patients, improving their ability to
determine if a biopsy is in their best interest; 4) Develop a risk assessment tool for men on active surveillance to assist patients and physicians with decision making regarding biopsy. The SABOR EDRN Clinical Validation Center, established in 2000, has a long history of development of new tests for prostate cancer and critically evaluating such tests to ensure that, if they are used in the clinic, patients benefit from their use. Using the 4000-man SABOR cohort with other established cohorts (e.g., SWOG PCPT and PASS), Phase II and III validation studies will be conducted to improve biomarker performance related to prostate cancer risk and long term disease outcomes. The first aim focuses on assessing long term performance of current biomarkers including PHI, PCA3 and TMPRSS2:ERG. Also proposed in this aim are validation studies of constitutional genetic variants that may identify men at greater cancer risk or who are more likely to have poor disease outcomes. In aim 2, tissue microarrays (TMAs) will be developed for validating published markers of prognosis. In addition, TMAs that allow evaluation of performance of new tissue-based markers in ethnical/racial diverse tumors will be constructed. For the third aim, the PCPT risk calculator will be refined and a new tool developed to help men on active surveillance determine if a surveillance biopsy is necessary. The Center will continue its work to provide carefully-collected samples from patients to other investigators to either help discover the tests of the future or to conduct studies to ensure that the tests trul help patients. In addition, the SABOR scientific personnel will continue to provide service in leadership positions of the EDRN to ensure that the entire Network accelerates toward the goal of successful early detection and cure of cancer."

3U01CA200466-02S1	U01CA200466	9463066	2017	Validation of biomarkers for early diagnosis and risk prediction of pancreatic neoplasms	"﻿   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A majority of pancreatic cancer (PC) patients (> 80%) present with an unresectable primary tumor with distant metastasis at the time of diagnosis due to its asymptomatic nature and lack of methods for early detection. While the overall 5-year survival rate of PC is dismal, signiﬁcantly better outcomes have been reported for early stage smaller tumors. PC is believed to progress through a series of histological changes and recent estimates indicate that these changes require 15-20 years to develop into invasive metastatic disease, hence providing a window of opportunity to intervene. While early diagnosis is an obvious strategy to improve the survival of PC patients, lack of non-invasive biomarkers for risk prediction of precursor lesions or early stage invasive disease impedes our ability to diagnose PC during this ""window. Premalignant cystic lesions of the pancreas offer unique opportunity for early diagnosis. To meet the EDRN stated goal of performing a validation study for early cancer detection and risk assessment likely to yield meaningful results within 5 years, we propose an innovative approach that could lead to the development of a clinically useful biomarker in this time frame. Additionally, we propose to study cystic neoplasms since IPMN and MCN offer a unique opportunity to identify pancreatic premalignant lesions and serve as a target for early detection strategies. The candidate biomarkers studies in our application have been identified and evaluated over the past 5 years in EDRN-funded biomarker developmental laboratories (BDLs). Studies from the laboratories of participating investigators have conclusively established that mucin overexpression is a hallmark of pancreatic cancer and have identified biomarkers (MUC5AC and its 2 glycoforms, MUC4 and a glycoform of endorepellin) that can effectively distinguish a) patients with resectable PC patients from patients with benign pancreatic diseases; b) mucinous and non- mucinous cysts; c) high-grade from moderate- and low-grade mucinous cysts and d). high-risk intestinal type IPMNs and low risk gastric type IPMNs. The overall objective of this CVC proposal is to demonstrate the ability of the aforementioned biomarkers to distinguish pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PC) patients from healthy controls, patients with benign biliary obstruction and chronic pancreatitis (CP), and to identify those cysts with high malignant potential. We have a large number of high quality, well-characterized specimens from patients with pancreatic disease and diseased controls that were collected and processed following protocols developed through the EDRN. Two specific aims are proposed. Aim 1 will use available samples from our biospecimen repository to evaluate MUC5AC and MUC4 as biomarkers to distinguish pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PC) patients from healthy controls, and from patients with benign biliary obstruction and chronic pancreatitis (CP). Aim 2 will determine if our biomarkers can identify those cysts with high lethal potential from those with a low risk for malignant transformation."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Early detection of PDAC is an area of highest priority and an unmet need for advancing public health in the United States. Certain sub-groups of patients, such as those with mucinous pancreatic cysts are at higher risk for progression to PDAC, but even in these cohorts, there is potential for over-diagnosis, underscoring the need for biomarkers that can accurately distinguish aggressive versus indolent cysts. The long term goal of our EDRN Clinical Validation Center (CVC), comprised of MD Anderson (MDACC), University of Utah and Indiana University, is to implement a multi-institutional framework for collecting the highest quality biospecimens from patients with a variety of well-defined pancreatic pathologies in order to conduct biomarker validation studies for early detection of PDAC that conform to EDRN-defined Phase 2 and Phase 3 study design. Specifically, this CVC will prospectively recruit at least 600 patients with early stage (resected) PDAC, at least 300 patients with surgically resected pancreatic cystic lesions of varying histology and grades of dysplasia, at least 400 benign pancreatic diseases (including chronic pancreatitis, benign cysts, endocrine tumors of low malignant potential), at least 300 patients with non-resected pancreatic cystic lesions that have follow up of 2 years or greater without evidence for progression, and at least 300 control patients with non- pancreatic diseases, in order to obtain plasma and serum samples from these subjects for biomarker validation studies. Additionally, we will obtain cyst fluid samples from all patients with pancreatic cystic lesions, both surgically resected and those being followed by endoscopic imaging. In accordance with the EDRN principles, these biospecimens will be utilized in facilitating collaborations with other BDLs, for biomarker discovery and validation studies. Preliminary data generated in our CVC has identified a focused panel of overexpressed autoantibodies and antigens (ERBB2, TNC, ESR1, CACNA1D and CDKN2AIP) that significantly improves CA19-9 AUC in both diagnostic and pre-diagnostic cohorts. We will use a hybrid array platform developed at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC) that is capable of quantifying both antigens and autoantibodies from plasma, and use this platform to complete three PRoBE compliant biomarker studies: Study 1 will be an EDRN-defined Phase 3 study in pre-diagnostic PDAC samples (n=158) and matched controls (n=158) from WHI and PLCO cohorts, followed by an EDRN-defined Phase 2 case control study of early stage (resectable) PDAC (N = 300) versus chronic pancreatitis (N = 300) and non-pancreatic disease controls (N=300); Study 2 will be an EDRN-defined Phase 3 study in PLCO pre-diagnostic PDAC samples (n=160), and matched controls (n=160); and Study 3 will be an EDRN-defined Phase 2 case control study of pancreatic cystic neoplasms with high-grade dysplasia or cancer (N =150) versus pancreatic cystic neoplasms with surgically confirmed low-grade dysplasia and non-mucinous cystic lesions (N=150), as well as low-risk cyst with adequate follow up that are followed without surgery (N=150)."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This multidisciplinary effort of experts in biomarker research proposes to renew their commitment to the EDRN and to lead our Clinical Validation Center ever closer to impacting patient care. Therefore we propose to test best candidate biomarkers of lung cancer developed at our and other institutions for added value in the assessment of the risk for, and diagnosis of, lung cancer compared to the standard of care. The hypothesis is that addition of imaging and molecular biomarkers measured by chest computed tomography and in the sputum, the bronchial epithelium and blood, likely in a multivariable manner, could improve the identification of high risk individuals for lung cancer and improve CT screening overall results by reducing false-positive tests. We propose a three way approach. First we will test candidate biomarkers for lung cancer development in an observational study of selected very high risk individuals from the Nashville community performing repeated measurements of clinical, imaging (low-dose chest CT) variables, as well as molecular biomarker signatures, some of which will be obtained from bronchoscopy. Second, we propose to validate the most promising diagnostic candidate signatures to each test in carefully designed prospective study of individuals presenting with indeterminate pulmonary nodules. Third, we will test a novel molecular imaging tracer in a population of intermediate and high risk lung nodules. This tracer will be compared to standard of care FDG PET, and if significantly better, should have huge impact on the management of lung nodules. Our CVC will also centralize an effort to collect and store pertinent clinical data and tissues (blood, urine, and the airways specimens) and make these resources available to the community and to collaborators within and outside of the EDRN program, including the industry partners."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to establish the Moffitt Imaging Biomarker Validation Center (MIBVAC) focused on imaging biomarker validations for early cancer detection and accurate risk assessments by leveraging our team of strong experts, resources, planned imaging biomarker validation studies, and analysis and network collaboration structures. In previous studies we have demonstrated that various measurements from breast images quantify breast cancer risk. The large cooperative National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) also showed a significant survival improvement for individuals screened by low dose CT compared to those screened with conventional radiography. Additionally, we have recently shown that CT image analysis (radiomics) can improve classification in this data set. However, due to difficulties in obtaining accurate and reproducible measurements and high false-positive rates of current imaging, cancer imaging biomarkers have not been routinely incorporated into clinical risk assessment. If these imaging biomarkers can be accurately tailored at the individual level, their impact will be significantly improved for early cancer detection and intervention. MIBVAC plans to achieve this challenging yet quite achievable goal by rigorously evaluating and validating these imaging biomarkers for rapid translation into clinical and practical applications. We have four specific aims: (Aim 1) Establish breast imaging resources for EDRN both with our existing and new case-control datasets of breast images and to evaluate and validate breast imaging biomarkers based on newly-established case-control dataset of digital breast tomosynthesis (TS) images, (Aim 2) Evaluate and validate lung imaging biomarkers for early detection of cancer first based on NLST low-dose CT (LDCT) cohorts and then expanding with a newly-established case-control cohort of higher resolution LDCT, (Aim 3) Conduct validation studies with imaging biomarkers for EDRN partners and others for other malignancies, and (Aim 4) Refine and validate imaging biomarkers analytically for early detection of breast, lung, and other cancers and to construct MIBVAC imaging data and specimen resources for EDRN collaborations and sharing."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We hypothesize that early detection, targeting aggressive prostate cancer, will enable survival benefits of treatment for lethal disease, and reduce harms of over-treatment for indolent disease. Toward this goal, we assemble biospecimen sample sets via rigorous SOP's in cohorts designed to avoid bias. We provide these specimens and guidance regarding study design to Discovery Labs, industry and consortia. Team efforts between the DMCC, the Hopkins BRL, industry partners, UTHSC-SA and our CVC facilitated FDA approval of the Prostate Health Index (phi - with data from our CVC's first cycle), and urinary PCA3 (with data from the current cycle). In two funding cycles, our CVC enrolled 4,821 subjects. We helped advance the TMPRSS2:Erg fusion (T2:Erg) discovery by the Chinnaiyan BDL toward actionable clinical use, completing 3 Aims with progress on the 4th: First, we combined urinary detection of T2:Erg with urinary PCA3 to improve specificity of detecting cancers with Gleason score > 7, validated this algorithm in a multi-center cohort, and showed the potential to reduce health care cost via this algorithm in men less than 65 years old. Second, we characterized community-based distribution of urinary T2:Erg, PCA3, and phi independent of PSA screening, and found race- based differences in these parameters, paving the way for a phase IV screening trial (separate proposal under review by DOD). Third, we compared prostatectomy tissue Erg expression to urinary T2:Erg, guiding the range of appropriate urinary T2:Erg cut-points to reflect tissue status. Fourth, we procured biopsies from two nation- wide, retrospective watchful waiting cohorts (PHS and HPFS), enrolled subjects onto the PASS Trial, and assembled a biospecimen set suitable for evaluating multiplex RNA's to discern aggressive from indolent disease. Recognizing limitations of T2:Erg as a classifier of cancer aggressiveness, we initiated clinical translation of a 24-gene,
multiplex RNA panel for discerning aggressive from indolent prostate cancer; showed the feasibility of this assay in biopsy tissue and urine, and identified an industry partner to evaluat this signature on a clinical grade platform. We will expand our validation studies to include imaging to assess cancer severity based on FACBC, a PET radiotracer undergoing clinical development. We are expanding the breadth of our CVC from previously being limited to academic medical centers (AMC's), to now including an urban indigent care hospital, a Veterans Administration Medical Center, and a suburban community hospital (in addition to our host AMC) so that we project enrolling 1050 African-American men, substantially diversifying the EDRN biospecimen resource. We now propose the following Aims: 1) To validate the combination of urine PCA3, T2:Erg and serum phi as predictive of aggressive prostate cancer de novo and for active surveillance; 2) To validate a multiplex RNA signature of aggressive prostate cancer in biopsy samples and post-DRE urine; 3) To validate FACBC as imaging to detect occult metastatic disease in high-risk, localized prostate cancer; 4) To collaborate with EDRN BDL's, CVC's and BRL's to advance prostate cancer biomarker development.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Early detection of PDAC is an area of highest priority and an unmet need for advancing public health in the United States. Certain sub-groups of patients, such as those with mucinous pancreatic cysts are at higher risk for progression to PDAC, but even in these cohorts, there is potential for over-diagnosis, underscoring the need for biomarkers that can accurately distinguish aggressive versus indolent cysts. The long term goal of our EDRN Clinical Validation Center (CVC), comprised of MD Anderson (MDACC), University of Utah and Indiana University, is to implement a multi-institutional framework for collecting the highest quality biospecimens from patients with a variety of well-defined pancreatic pathologies in order to conduct biomarker validation studies for early detection of PDAC that conform to EDRN-defined Phase 2 and Phase 3 study design. Specifically, this CVC will prospectively recruit at least 600 patients with early stage (resected) PDAC, at least 300 patients with surgically resected pancreatic cystic lesions of varying histology and grades of dysplasia, at least 400 benign pancreatic diseases (including chronic pancreatitis, benign cysts, endocrine tumors of low malignant potential), at least 300 patients with non-resected pancreatic cystic lesions that have follow up of 2 years or greater without evidence for progression, and at least 300 control patients with non- pancreatic diseases, in order to obtain plasma and serum samples from these subjects for biomarker validation studies. Additionally, we will obtain cyst fluid samples from all patients with pancreatic cystic lesions, both surgically resected and those being followed by endoscopic imaging. In accordance with the EDRN principles, these biospecimens will be utilized in facilitating collaborations with other BDLs, for biomarker discovery and validation studies. Preliminary data generated in our CVC has identified a focused panel of overexpressed autoantibodies and antigens (ERBB2, TNC, ESR1, CACNA1D and CDKN2AIP) that significantly improves CA19-9 AUC in both diagnostic and pre-diagnostic cohorts. We will use a hybrid array platform developed at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC) that is capable of quantifying both antigens and autoantibodies from plasma, and use this platform to complete three PRoBE compliant biomarker studies: Study 1 will be an EDRN-defined Phase 3 study in pre-diagnostic PDAC samples (n=158) and matched controls (n=158) from WHI and PLCO cohorts, followed by an EDRN-defined Phase 2 case control study of early stage (resectable) PDAC (N = 300) versus chronic pancreatitis (N = 300) and non-pancreatic disease controls (N=300); Study 2 will be an EDRN-defined Phase 3 study in PLCO pre-diagnostic PDAC samples (n=160), and matched controls (n=160); and Study 3 will be an EDRN-defined Phase 2 case control study of pancreatic cystic neoplasms with high-grade dysplasia or cancer (N =150) versus pancreatic cystic neoplasms with surgically confirmed low-grade dysplasia and non-mucinous cystic lesions (N=150), as well as low-risk cyst with adequate follow up that are followed without surgery (N=150).

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to establish the Moffitt Imaging Biomarker Validation Center (MIBVAC) focused on imaging biomarker validations for early cancer detection and accurate risk assessments by leveraging our team of strong experts, resources, planned imaging biomarker validation studies, and analysis and network collaboration structures. In previous studies we have demonstrated that various measurements from breast images quantify breast cancer risk. The large cooperative National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) also showed a significant survival improvement for individuals screened by low dose CT compared to those screened with conventional radiography. Additionally, we have recently shown that CT image analysis (radiomics) can improve classification in this data set. However, due to difficulties in obtaining accurate and reproducible measurements and high false-positive rates of current imaging, cancer imaging biomarkers have not been routinely incorporated into clinical risk assessment. If these imaging biomarkers can be accurately tailored at the individual level, their impact will be significantly improved for early cancer detection and intervention. MIBVAC plans to achieve this challenging yet quite achievable goal by rigorously evaluating and validating these imaging biomarkers for rapid translation into clinical and practical applications. We have four specific aims: (Aim 1) Establish breast imaging resources for EDRN both with our existing and new case-control datasets of breast images and to evaluate and validate breast imaging biomarkers based on newly-established case-control dataset of digital breast tomosynthesis (TS) images, (Aim 2) Evaluate and validate lung imaging biomarkers for early detection of cancer first based on NLST low-dose CT (LDCT) cohorts and then expanding with a newly-established case-control cohort of higher resolution LDCT, (Aim 3) Conduct validation studies with imaging biomarkers for EDRN partners and others for other malignancies, and (Aim 4) Refine and validate imaging biomarkers analytically for early detection of breast, lung, and other cancers and to construct MIBVAC imaging data and specimen resources for EDRN collaborations and sharing."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prostate cancer is the most common non-cutaneous cancer in American men. In May of 2012, the U.S. Preventive Task Force recommended that serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) screening no longer be recommended as standard clinical practice. A factor contributing to this recommendation is that many prostate cancers diagnosed via PSA-screening are indolent disease that will never progress. Current American Urologic Association recommendations stress informed decision making. To this end, this Clinical Validation Center will address the following major unmet clinical needs: 1) Optimize serum PSA screening protocols to identify men with aggressive diseases and reduce screening and detection of men with low risk disease (aim 1); 2) Validate markers that distinguish indolent versus aggressive disease using serum, DNA, urine, and tissue markers (aims 1 and 2); 3) Enhancing risk assessment for informed decision for individual patients, improving their ability to
determine if a biopsy is in their best interest; 4) Develop a risk assessment tool for men on active surveillance to assist patients and physicians with decision making regarding biopsy. The SABOR EDRN Clinical Validation Center, established in 2000, has a long history of development of new tests for prostate cancer and critically evaluating such tests to ensure that, if they are used in the clinic, patients benefit from their use. Using the 4000-man SABOR cohort with other established cohorts (e.g., SWOG PCPT and PASS), Phase II and III validation studies will be conducted to improve biomarker performance related to prostate cancer risk and long term disease outcomes. The first aim focuses on assessing long term performance of current biomarkers including PHI, PCA3 and TMPRSS2:ERG. Also proposed in this aim are validation studies of constitutional genetic variants that may identify men at greater cancer risk or who are more likely to have poor disease outcomes. In aim 2, tissue microarrays (TMAs) will be developed for validating published markers of prognosis. In addition, TMAs that allow evaluation of performance of new tissue-based markers in ethnical/racial diverse tumors will be constructed. For the third aim, the PCPT risk calculator will be refined and a new tool developed to help men on active surveillance determine if a surveillance biopsy is necessary. The Center will continue its work to provide carefully-collected samples from patients to other investigators to either help discover the tests of the future or to conduct studies to ensure that the tests trul help patients. In addition, the SABOR scientific personnel will continue to provide service in leadership positions of the EDRN to ensure that the entire Network accelerates toward the goal of successful early detection and cure of cancer.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There remain clear clinical and public health needs to improve the early detection of breast, colorectal, and ovary cancers. For breast and colorectal cancers effective, widely used screening tests exist, but for breast cancer there remain issues with respect to optimizing mammography's use and performance, and for colorectal cancer both limited access to and the invasiveness of colonoscopy are barriers to its wider use. Ovary cancer is less common but highly lethal, and no clinically useful tests for its early detection are
currently available. Through the current breast and ovary cancer EDRN Clinical Validation Center (CVC) led by Dr. Li and the current colorectal cancer EDRN Biomarker Development Laboratory (BDL) led by Dr. Lampe, we have discovered and validated promising sets of candidate early detection biomarkers for each of these three cancers that now warrant further Phase 2 and Phase 3 validation. We propose the following three projects: Project 1: Phase 3 validation of early detection biomarkers for ER+ breast cancer: Nine candidate biomarkers that have been preliminarily validated in preclinical samples will be assessed in an independent set of preclinical samples. Their intended clinical applications are to: 1. Inform timing of a subsequent mammogram in women with a negative screening mammogram; 2. Inform continuation of mammographic screening among women 75-79 years; 3. Prioritize women who should be screened with mammography in areas with limited resources. Project 2: Phase 3 validation of early detection biomarkers for colorectal cancer: We will validate five biomarkers that have been preliminarily validated in multiple sets of samples with performance that meets or exceeds those of existing fecal tests. Our intended clinical applications are to: 1. Identify people unwilling to undergo or with no access to colonoscopy who should be prioritized for colonoscopy (improve/replace existing FIT and Cologuard tests); 2. Among symptomatic patients identify those who have a very low risk of cancer and can avoid colonoscopy. Project 3: Phase 2 and 3 validation of auto- antibodies (AAb) as early detection biomarkers for serous ovarian cancer (SOC): Our overall goal is to combine novel AAb markers with currently available tests in a two-stage screening strategy with the potential to reduce ovarian cancer mortality. Our intended clinical applications are: 1. Use AAbs in conjunction with CA125 as a first line screening test; 2. Use AAbs in conjunction with HE4 for cancer early detection in women with rising CA125. In addition, we will serve as an EDRN collaborative resource providing biospecimens and expertise to support high quality PRoBE compliant EDRN discovery and validation studies across cancer types. With the combined expertise of our multidisciplinary team of investigators, this CVC will both lead well- justified, rigorously designed validation studies and provide abundant resources to EDRN. Given the strength of our biomarker candidates, the sets of biospecimens that will be used, the study designs employed, and the clearly delineated clinical applications proposed, we anticipate that this work will yield near-ter clinical impact.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Advances in cytoreductive surgery and combination chemotherapy have improved 5-year survival in patients with epithelial ovarian cancer, but the rate of cure remains essentially unchanged over the last two decades. Computer models suggest that detection of ovarian cancer in early stage (I-II) could improve rates of cure by 10-30%. Sequential use of serum biomarkers measured over time followed by TVS in a small fraction of postmenopausal women with rising CA125 has proven more specific and more sensitive than either modality used alone. Using this strategy, the United Kingdom Collaborative Trial for Ovarian Cancer Screening (UKCTOCS) and the Normal Risk Ovarian Cancer Screening Study (NROSS) in the United States have shown that only 3 operations are required to detect each case of ovarian cancer. Over the last 13 years, our group has conducted the NROSS study in 4,904 postmenopausal women at average risk for ovarian cancer. Annual determinations of CA125 have been analyzed by the Risk of Ovarian Cancer Algorithm (ROCA) developed by Dr. Skates. If the risk does not change, women return in a year; if it increases markedly, TVS is performed and participants are referred to a gynecologic oncologist; if the risk is intermediate CA125 is repeated in 3 months. Fifteen operations have been performed to detect 10 ovarian cancers. Two were borderline tumors and 8 were invasive with 8 of the 10 (80%) in Stage I or II. The NROSS trial has utilized a well-coordinated network of 7 sites in the United States where 22,981 blood samples have been obtained, processed and stored with standard operating protocols. Pre-operative specimens from MDACC have been banked from 502 women with ovarian cancer and 737 with benign disease. This has provided a valuable resource for evaluating new biomarkers. As CA125 is expressed by only 80% of epithelial ovarian cancers, additional biomarkers will be required to optimize sensitivity. Our group has found that HE4 and CA72.4 can detect 16% of the cases missed by CA125 in samples from the UKCTOCS trial. Autoantibodies to tumor associated antigens have shown even greater promise. Elevated levels of autoantibodies against TP53 have been found in 20-25% of patients with normal CA125 at the time of conventional diagnosis. Titers of anti-TP53 rise 13.5 months (mean) prior to CA125 and 33 months (mean) prior to diagnosis in patients who present without an increase in CA125. At present we are developing a new ROCA that incorporates CA125, HE4, CA72.4 and anti-TP53 autoantibody data. A multidisciplinary team of 27 investigators will pursue the following Specific Aims: 1) to conduct a screening trial to determine the specificity and positive predictive value for a 4 biomarker ROCA including CA125, HE4, CA72.4 and anti-TP53 autoantibodies in a two stage strategy for early detection of ovarian cancer in postmenopausal women at average risk for the disease; 2) to maintain and share a serum and plasma bank to facilitate evaluation of novel biomarkers for early detection; 3) to collaborate with other Centers in the EDRN to evaluate additional biomarkers for early detection of ovarian cancer.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to establish the Moffitt Imaging Biomarker Validation Center (MIBVAC) focused on imaging biomarker validations for early cancer detection and accurate risk assessments by leveraging our team of strong experts, resources, planned imaging biomarker validation studies, and analysis and network collaboration structures. In previous studies we have demonstrated that various measurements from breast images quantify breast cancer risk. The large cooperative National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) also showed a significant survival improvement for individuals screened by low dose CT compared to those screened with conventional radiography. Additionally, we have recently shown that CT image analysis (radiomics) can improve classification in this data set. However, due to difficulties in obtaining accurate and reproducible measurements and high false-positive rates of current imaging, cancer imaging biomarkers have not been routinely incorporated into clinical risk assessment. If these imaging biomarkers can be accurately tailored at the individual level, their impact will be significantly improved for early cancer detection and intervention. MIBVAC plans to achieve this challenging yet quite achievable goal by rigorously evaluating and validating these imaging biomarkers for rapid translation into clinical and practical applications. We have four specific aims: (Aim 1) Establish breast imaging resources for EDRN both with our existing and new case-control datasets of breast images and to evaluate and validate breast imaging biomarkers based on newly-established case-control dataset of digital breast tomosynthesis (TS) images, (Aim 2) Evaluate and validate lung imaging biomarkers for early detection of cancer first based on NLST low-dose CT (LDCT) cohorts and then expanding with a newly-established case-control cohort of higher resolution LDCT, (Aim 3) Conduct validation studies with imaging biomarkers for EDRN partners and others for other malignancies, and (Aim 4) Refine and validate imaging biomarkers analytically for early detection of breast, lung, and other cancers and to construct MIBVAC imaging data and specimen resources for EDRN collaborations and sharing.

1U01CA200466-01	U01CA200466	8996976	2016	Validation of biomarkers for early diagnosis and risk prediction of pancreatic neoplasms	"﻿   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A majority of pancreatic cancer (PC) patients (> 80%) present with an unresectable primary tumor with distant metastasis at the time of diagnosis due to its asymptomatic nature and lack of methods for early detection. While the overall 5-year survival rate of PC is dismal, signiﬁcantly better outcomes have been reported for early stage smaller tumors. PC is believed to progress through a series of histological changes and recent estimates indicate that these changes require 15-20 years to develop into invasive metastatic disease, hence providing a window of opportunity to intervene. While early diagnosis is an obvious strategy to improve the survival of PC patients, lack of non-invasive biomarkers for risk prediction of precursor lesions or early stage invasive disease impedes our ability to diagnose PC during this ""window. Premalignant cystic lesions of the pancreas offer unique opportunity for early diagnosis. To meet the EDRN stated goal of performing a validation study for early cancer detection and risk assessment likely to yield meaningful results within 5 years, we propose an innovative approach that could lead to the development of a clinically useful biomarker in this time frame. Additionally, we propose to study cystic neoplasms since IPMN and MCN offer a unique opportunity to identify pancreatic premalignant lesions and serve as a target for early detection strategies. The candidate biomarkers studies in our application have been identified and evaluated over the past 5 years in EDRN-funded biomarker developmental laboratories (BDLs). Studies from the laboratories of participating investigators have conclusively established that mucin overexpression is a hallmark of pancreatic cancer and have identified biomarkers (MUC5AC and its 2 glycoforms, MUC4 and a glycoform of endorepellin) that can effectively distinguish a) patients with resectable PC patients from patients with benign pancreatic diseases; b) mucinous and non- mucinous cysts; c) high-grade from moderate- and low-grade mucinous cysts and d). high-risk intestinal type IPMNs and low risk gastric type IPMNs. The overall objective of this CVC proposal is to demonstrate the ability of the aforementioned biomarkers to distinguish pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PC) patients from healthy controls, patients with benign biliary obstruction and chronic pancreatitis (CP), and to identify those cysts with high malignant potential. We have a large number of high quality, well-characterized specimens from patients with pancreatic disease and diseased controls that were collected and processed following protocols developed through the EDRN. Two specific aims are proposed. Aim 1 will use available samples from our biospecimen repository to evaluate MUC5AC and MUC4 as biomarkers to distinguish pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PC) patients from healthy controls, and from patients with benign biliary obstruction and chronic pancreatitis (CP). Aim 2 will determine if our biomarkers can identify those cysts with high lethal potential from those with a low risk for malignant transformation.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is a renewal of our EDRN Biomarker Reference Laboratory (BRL) which is located within the Clinical Chemistry Division (CCD) of the Johns Hopkins Medical Laboratories (JHML) at the Johns Hopkins Hospital. The BRL will continue to serve as a network resource for clinical and laboratory validation of biomarkers, which includes technological development and assay refinement. The JHML are certified by the College of American Pathologist (CAP) and regulated by CLIA (Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988). As such, the JHML follow stringent, good laboratory practice (GLP) guidelines for quality control and quality assurance. The proposed product development will be conducted at the Center for Biomarker Discovery and Translation (CBDT) at The Johns Hopkins University. The project goal is to validate serum proteomic biomarkers, including two biomarkers discovered in our current EDRN BRL developmental study, for the prediction of aggressive prostate cancer in men prior to prostate biopsy. The product ""AGPC"" is an in vitro diagnostic multivariate index assay (IVDMIA) that combines a panel of biomarkers into a single-valued numerical index score. We have assembled a strong team of research and clinical scientists with many years of experience with cancer biomarkers and in technology development, study design, bioinformatics, validation, and translation. Dr. Chan, the PI, is the Director of both CCD and CBDT. He has over 30 years of experience in clinical chemistry and has conducted many (> 75) research studies funded by industry on cancer diagnostics leading to the approval by the FDA. Since the inception of the EDRN in 2000, five EDRN developed assays have been approved by the FDA for clinical use. Of these five, our BRL led the development of serum OVA1 for ovarian cancer, serum proPSA (phi) for prostate cancer, and served as the reference lab for the urine PCA3 study for prostate cancer. In fact, OVA1 which is based on our original multiplex proteomic study published in Cancer Research, was the first proteomic IVDMIA ever cleared by the FDA for clinical use. In addition, three leading diagnostics/biotechnology companies have agreed to collaborate with us in our product development proposal. In this renewal, we plan to continue our strong commitment to the EDRN mission through network collaborations, and provide leadership in biomarker validation, technology/assay improvement, and product development. With this multi-disciplinary team of scientists, the BRL at Johns Hopkins offers the best opportunity for the success of cancer biomarker validation and translation into the clinic for the early detection of cancer."

The JHML are certified by the College of American Pathologist (CAP) and regulated by CLIA (Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988). As such, the JHML follow stringent, good laboratory practice (GLP) guidelines for quality control and quality assurance. The proposed product development will be conducted at the Center for Biomarker Discovery and Translation (CBDT) at The Johns Hopkins University. The project goal is to validate serum proteomic biomarkers, including two biomarkers discovered in our current EDRN BRL developmental study, for the prediction of aggressive prostate cancer in men prior to prostate biopsy. The product ""AGPC"" is an in vitro diagnostic multivariate index assay (IVDMIA) that combines a panel of biomarkers into a single-valued numerical index score. We have assembled a strong team of research and clinical scientists with many years of experience with cancer biomarkers and in technology development, study design, bioinformatics, validation, and translation. Dr. Chan, the PI, is the Director of both CCD and CBDT. He has over 30 years of experience in clinical chemistry and has conducted many (> 75) research studies funded by industry on cancer diagnostics leading to the approval by the FDA. Since the inception of the EDRN in 2000, five EDRN developed assays have been approved by the FDA for clinical use. Of these five, our BRL led the development of serum OVA1 for ovarian cancer, serum proPSA (phi) for prostate cancer, and served as the reference lab for the urine PCA3 study for prostate cancer. In fact, OVA1 which is based on our original multiplex proteomic study published in Cancer Research, was the first proteomic IVDMIA ever cleared by the FDA for clinical use. In addition, three leading diagnostics/biotechnology companies have agreed to collaborate with us in our product development proposal. In this renewal, we plan to continue our strong commitment to the EDRN mission through network collaborations, and provide leadership in biomarker validation, technology/assay improvement, and product development. With this multi-disciplinary team of scientists, the BRL at Johns Hopkins offers the best opportunity for the success of cancer biomarker validation and translation into the clinic for the early detection of cancer."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a renewal application for the University of Maryland Baltimore Biomarker Reference Laboratory (UMB BRL). Over the past 5 years the UMB BRL (PI, Sanford Stass, MD) have been active collaborating and supporting the Early Detection Research Network (EDRN). The PI participated on multiple EDRN committees/activities. The UMB BRL has provided resources for analytical and clinical validation of biomarkers, assay development/technologies, and standardization of assay methods in collaboration with multiple investigators. The UMB BRL is organized as a team of directors/co-investigators with broad EDRN knowledge, experience, expertise and provides a wide range of core pathology laboratories with CLIA and/or CAP accreditation including next generation sequencing, clinical chemistry, molecular diagnostics, flow cytometry, cytogenetics, and GLP compliant laboratories. There are also core laboratories including genomics, mass spectrometry, NMR tissue bank, and biostatistics. There is a product development study, with the objective to develop targeted next generation sequencing (NGS) using Ion Torrent (ITO) for miRNAs biomarkers (developed here) in sputum obtained with the Lung Flute (LF) for the early detection of non-small-cell lung cancer in patients with nodules on CT scan. There are 3 specific aims: (1) To validate whether the 102 miRNA biomarker candidates of lung cancer we recently identified, which include 2 miRNAs from our previous EDRN study, can be analyzed in lung tumor samples by using the IoT-targeted NGS platform in a CLIA accredited laboratory. (2) To optimize a panel of highly specific and sensitive sputum miRNA biomarkers for identifying malignant pulmonary nodules using our retrospective sputum specimens with the IoT platform. (3) To validate analytical and clinical performance of the biomarker panel using the IoT in prospectively collected sputum samples from the University of Maryland, Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center, and the New York University Langone Medical Center using the Lung Flute. The UMB BRL leverages the experience of its multi-disciplinary investigators and considerable expertise of the leadership to provide flexible support to the EDRN for standardized procedures, high throughput, robust assays, clinical translation, design and conduct analytical validation studies, a variety of laboratory/platform assays, GLP compliance, and adherence to regulatory requirements including CLIA/CAP, FDA, and GLP. Numerous collaborations are within and outside UMB guaranteeing maximum responsiveness to the EDRN. Lines of authority/organizational structure in the UMB BRL ensure timely performance, efficient communication and rapid translation of findings from the development phase into clinical application."

This application proposes the formation of a University of Michigan (UM) EDRN Biomarker Development Lab
(BDL). Through previous EDRN BDLs, our team has characterized multiple important prostate cancer
biomarkers, most notably TMPRSS2-ETS gene fusions. Through collaboration with an EDRN Clinical
Validation Center (CVC; Dr. Sanda PI), we have developed, validated and clinically implemented Mi-Prostate
Score (MiPS), a prostate cancer early detection test incorporating urine quantification of two prostate cancer
specific transcripts—the TMPRSS2:ERG gene fusion and PCA3—with serum PSA. Introduced in our CLIA
laboratory (and now with New York State approval), MiPS helps shared decision making after PSA testing
based on individualized risk predictions of aggressive prostate cancer on biopsy. Here, using this work as a
model, we will discover and characterize aggressive prostate cancer transcriptomic biomarkers, focusing on
long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). Although lncRNA biomarker utility has been largely unexplored, we recently
characterized the lncRNA compendium (“MiTranscriptome”), identifying several prostate cancer-specific and
aggressive prostate cancer-specific lncRNAs. Supporting our proposed approach, we have performed initial
validation of the lncRNA SChLAP1 as an aggressive prostate cancer specific biomarker in tissues. Likewise,
we have developed RT-PCR based next generation sequencing (NGS) panels capable of quantifying
multiplexed transcriptomic biomarkers in archived tissue and urine. Here, in three Aims, we will nominate and
develop transcriptomic biomarkers as predictors of aggressive prostate cancer both at and prior to diagnosis.
In Aim 1, we will identify novel aggressive prostate cancer-associated transcriptomic alterations from our
MiTranscriptome analysis. We will develop single gene and multiplexed NGS assays to study these
lncRNAs/coding transcripts as aggressive prostate cancers specific biomarkers. In Aim 2 we will characterize
transcripts from Aim 1 as tissue based aggressive prostate cancer biomarkers. Following our previous
approach with SChLAP1, we will develop individual in situ hybridization assays and a multiplexed NGS panel
to characterize these transcripts in well characterized prostate cancer tissue cohorts. In Aim 3, we will
characterize transcripts identified in Aim 1 as non-invasive, urine-based aggressive prostate cancer early
detection biomarkers. Through collaboration with Hologic/Gen-Probe (our industry partner on MiPS), we will
develop and assesses the performance of individual prioritized biomarkers using their platform on our
biobanked urine samples. Additionally, using multiplexed NGS, we will also characterize the performance of a
panel of transcriptomic biomarkers as an alternative/complementary approach. As recognized by the EDRN,
novel aggressive prostate cancer specific biomarkers are urgently needed. Importantly, our approach extends
beyond prostate cancer and our BDL, and our group has actively participated in the EDRN biomarker
community and anticipates continuing work with other BDLs and CVCs to facilitate the overall EDRN mission."

3U01CA214183-05S1	U01CA214183	10463888	2021	Breast Cancer Detection Consortium	"Abstract
 Mammography is an early detection modality for breast cancer that is implemented
widely in the United States, has established benchmarks of performance, and in most studies
throughout the world has been demonstrated to reduce mortality due to the disease. This
relatively inexpensive x-ray imaging of the breast also provides a location that can be directly
sampled through needle biopsy which leads generally to an unambiguous pathologic diagnosis
of invasive cancer, carcinoma in situ, or benign findings. No system is perfect and
mammographic screening, particularly in the US, prompts over 1.6 million biopsies per year
detecting approximately 230,000 invasive and 60,000 non-invasive cancers for a positive
predictive value of less than 20%. There may be substantial room to improve on this and
reduce the number of biopsies but this improvement must not sacrifice detection rates so the
negative predictive value (NPV, identification of true negatives) must remain very high. In this
Biomarker Development Laboratory application, we propose to test whether a combination of
mammographic feature analysis and candidate biomarkers that we have identified can achieve
an NPV that would be acceptable to patients and providers to prevent unnecessary breast
biopsies. One of the biomarkers is a type of circulating giant cell termed “Cancer Associated
Macrophage Like” (CAML) that can only be detected using freshly drawn whole blood, we
propose to conduct a prospective trial at Duke University in women undergoing breast cancer
diagnosis. Our realistic goal is to accrue ~1000 women over the course of 4 years for which full
field digital mammography has been performed. The images will undergo feature extraction for
decision modeling. Blood will be analyzed for the presence and type of CAML cells,
immunosignaturing using the high density peptide arrays developed by Stephen Johnston at
Arizona State, and measurements of two specific analytes that have the highest sensitivity and
specificity for basal type cancers, CA125 and TP53 autoantibodies. As feature analysis from
imaging alone can achieve, at least for masses on mammography, an AUC of ~0.9, the study is
designed to determine whether the biomarkers have sufficient complementary information to the
imaging and each other to increase the AUC to 0.95 allowing us to identify a threshold where
there is a 98% NPV. We will make use of the most careful and consistent standard operating
procedures, the best candidate biomarkers, and the most well developed imaging algorithms to
make this a definitive study."

Ultrasensitive Detection of Tumor Specific DNA Methylation Changes for the Early Detection of
Lung Cancer 
ABSTRACT 
This proposal seeks to improve upon the management of lung cancer through detection of
tumor specific abnormal DNA methylation. Despite highly publicized advances in genomics and
proteomics, the promise of non-invasive diagnostics and personalized medicine remains largely
unrealized. Recently, comprehensive determination of genetic and epigenetic aberrations has
become a major activity in cancer research since it is well understood that these aberrations
provide clues to the process of tumorigenesis. The applicants have developed extremely
sensitive assays for the detection of hypermethylated DNA sequences. They have also
optimized the isolation and processing of circulating cell free DNA from tumors for these
sensitive methods. The comprehensive genome wide analysis of molecular changes in cancer
completed by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) has been used to identify many highly
frequent cancer specific methylation events in lung cancer that will be combined with an
integrated approach to sample processing and preparation and novel sensitive detection
strategies to provide utrasensitive detection of tumor specific changes in DNA methylation in
blood and sputum samples. With a large population based screening cohort, the Pittsburgh
Lung Screening Study, they will develop and characterize the performance of sensitive methods
for detecting cancer specific changes in DNA methylation. This molecular detection will
compliment CT screening to address the important issue of early detection of lung cancer."

With the increasing adoption of computed tomography (CT) as a screening tool for lung cancer, methods
for identifying the small number of patients with malignant nodules from among the large number of patients
with benign CT-detected nodules is a growing and urgent clinical need. We have targeted the problem of
developing biomarkers for detecting malignant solid or part-solid nodules that are 6 – 25 mm in diameter that
are identified by screening at risk individuals or found incidentally in screen-eligible individuals. The ability to
sensitively detect lung cancer in this clinical setting could reduce many of the potentially harmful
consequences that currently arise from uncertainties about which of these indeterminate lung nodules require
the most aggressive workup. The core of our approach is the integration of molecular biomarkers measured
in non-invasively collected nasal brushes and plasma specimens together with complementary imaging and
clinical markers. On the basis of our preliminary data, we will use total RNA sequencing of both large and
small RNA to deeply characterize the cancer-associated airway-wide field of injury in nasal epithelium;
exosome-derived plasma miRNA to capture information about tumor-associated products found in the
circulation; and qualitative and quantitative imaging characteristics to capture information about the biology of
the nodule and the local environment that would otherwise only be available through direct sampling.
Further, we will be profiling these features in several unique cohorts of smokers with indeterminate nodules
detected either incidentally or by screening that represent the clinical population in which most lung cancers
are diagnosed. Our use of biorepositories that have been collected from the clinical settings in which the
biomarker would ultimately be applied, utilizing a prospective-specimen-collection, retrospective-blinded-
evaluation (PRoBE) design minimizes potential bias and improves applicability to the intended use
population. A key aspect of our biomarker development plan is a two-staged feature selection process that
will allow us to efficiently use patient cohorts to detect robustly cancer-associated molecular and imaging
features that will then be used to construct integrated cancer predictive models. The performance and
clinical utility of the resulting models will undergo preliminary validation studies at the end of the proposed
studies. This will allow us to make a GO / NO-GO decision about whether they should be subsequently
tested in larger validation trials based on a rigorous evaluation of their validity and also whether they
represent progress toward our goal of shrinking the intermediate risk category, thereby improving the
diagnostic workup of the large number of patients for whom there is currently considerable clinical
uncertainty."

United states. It is the second leading cause of cancer-related death. The clinical diversity of
PCa is dramatic, ranging from asymptomatic disease to metastatic and fatal malignancy. One
cause of this clinical diversity is the remarkable intra- and inter-tumoural heterogeneity in
disease genomics. As a result, currently clinically-used risk-stratification strategies do not
robustly discriminate aggressive from indolent diseases, leading to systemic over- and under-
treatment. Approximately 40% of men diagnosed with PCa who seek curative treatment
undergo surgical removal of their prostate (radical prostatectomy, RP). Of these, approximately
30% are found at surgery to have disease outside their prostate (non-organ-confined, non-OC).
These men are candidates for multi-modal adjuvant treatment with chemo- and hormone-
therapy to improve outcomes. We therefore propose to tackle this problem, using fluid
biomarkers to circumvent the molecular heterogeneity of the disease. Our proposal leverages
an active and productive multi-investigator, multi-institutional proteomic collaboration to develop
biomarkers for the early detection of locally aggressive non-organ-confined disease. Our two
lead biomarkers are 1) A multiple peptide panel that discriminates OC from non-OC in EDRN
phase 2 equivalent validation (Nature Communications, in press). 2) Surface expression of CUB
Domain Containing Protein 1 on exosomes differentiates PCa aggressiveness (EDRN Phase 1
equivalent discovery, Oncotarget, 2016). We propose both validation of these targets in a
globally-unique biobank of expressed prostatic secretions, as well as novel biomarker
discovery/development strategies to extend them in the same clinical context and sample
matrix. Successful completion of our proposed studies will result in validation of at least two
biomarkers for clinical utility in separation of OC vs. non-OC disease, helping to personalize
therapy for a tumour type that afflicts 1 in 7 North American men."

Despite advances in screening and treatment, mortalities from breast and lung cancers have remained high in
the US over the last 20 years. It is widely accepted that early detection is critical to improving outcomes in both
diseases. Both also rely on imaging for screening, but false positive and false negative detection are
associated with unnecessary biopsies, missed diagnoses, and costs. There is an urgent need for biochemical
markers that improve the performance of imaging technologies. Our laboratories have been successful at
identifying useful cancer biomarkers by exploiting patients’ own ability to produce antibodies against tumor-
associated antigens (TAA), referred to as tumor-associated autoantibodies (TAAb). With prior EDRN support,
we developed high-throughput programmable protein display methods for the rapid detection and validation of
autoantibody biomarker signatures in breast and lung cancers. Our breast cancer TAAb biomarkers have been
licensed and integrated into Videssa™ Breast that is now available as CLIA-certified test. Our triple negative
breast cancer markers have been validated in blinded phase 2 multicenter validation studies. These
demonstrate the great utility of TAAb in cancer early detection. However, the sensitivities of most TAAbs is
moderate and there is a suggestion that greater sensitivity and specificity could be obtained by examining
TAAb directed at aberrantly modified proteins in cancers. Our central hypothesis is that aberrant protein
glycosylation, a hallmark of breast and lung cancers, induces glycoprotein-specific TAAb that can be measured
as specific serum biomarkers of these cancers. Alterations in glycosylation are highly immunogenic, and there
is strong historical evidence for significant antibody responses to cancer-altered glycoproteins. However, all
current protein (or polypeptide) display tools allow limited or no post-translational modification. This historical
roadblock has prevented the identification of these biomarkers because of the lack of screening methods that
test immunogenic structural glycoproteins. We introduce a tool for the high-throughput display of full-length
proteins decorated with cancer-specific O-glycan structures. This will revolutionize the opportunity to screen
glycan-protein epitopes in their natural context. Our team comprises strong expertise in functional proteomics,
biomarker development, glycoproteomics, medical oncology and biostatistics. Targeted proteins will include:
the extra-cellular domains of relevant single pass membrane proteins, proteins known to be O-glycosylated
and overexpressed in the two cancers, and all known mucins. They will be translated in situ using human
ribosomes and chaperone proteins and then systematically decorated with Tn and STn O-GalNAc-type glycans
by consecutive addition of recombinant glycosyltransferases and sugar nucleotides to mirror what occurs in the
two cancers. Adhering to the principles of PRoBE design, we will screen these arrays with cancer patient and
control sera. Our study will focus on cancer patients and non-cancer subjects with positive imaging findings.
Study design will include Phase I discovery (arrays/ELISA) and Phase II validation using ELISA."

stages with little chance for survival. Biomarkers are needed to (1)determine which patients have been

determine which MPM patients are at highest risk for early recurrence or death. The EDRN

based markers (FBLN3, SOMAmer 13 classifier, HMGB1 Isoforms) and investigate whether immune-
oncologic gene expression differences in the cellular component of the circulating blood
microenvironment can stratify AE and MPM from other control cohorts. All of these in Phase I/II

will be performed with healthy, non-AE exposed, AE, MPM, and non- MPM cancer cohorts, followed by
a blinded validation in specimens provided by the Princess Margaret Cancer Center. The University of

effusion results will be compared to those obtained with the Soma 14 NYU MPM using validation
cohorts from an approved EDRN MPM screening program in Santiago, Chile and South Glasgow

significantly improve chances for early diagnosis and accurate prognostication of patients with MPM."

 Tens of millions of women undergo population-based screening for breast cancer by mammography. De-
spite the life-saving potential of early detection, screening guidelines for mammography are controversial and
continue to evolve. At issue are the specificity of mammography for distinguishing benign vs cancerous le-
sions, the sensitivity of mammography in some patient populations (e.g. women with dense breasts), and con-
cerns regarding over-diagnosis (e.g. some ductal carcinoma in situ). Our ultimate clinical aim is to develop a
blood test for early detection of breast cancer that can be used in conjunction with mammography to improve
sensitivity and specificity during screening, and thus have enormous clinical impact by detecting treatable can-
cers missed by mammography (reducing mortality) and by avoiding unnecessary invasive procedures for be-
nign or non-life-threatening disease.
 Despite considerable effort, attempts to identify blood-based screening biomarkers for early detection of
breast cancer have failed, due to technological and methodological limitations. Clearly new approaches are
warranted. We are proposing a completely novel strategy, based on the initial discovery of candidate bi-
omarkers in the plasma of “avatar mice” (harboring early passage human breast cancer xenografts), and fol-
lowed by biomarker triage and validation using a novel biomarker pipeline based on a targeted form of mass
spectrometry (MS), multiple reaction monitoring (MRM). If successful, this study could provide a road map for
applying this general approach to other cancer sites, beyond breast cancer.
 Briefly, candidate circulating biomarkers identified in the avatar mouse plasma will be verified in the plasma
from the human patients and prioritized for further testing based on integrative proteo-genomic analyses using
large breast cancer datasets generated by NCI genomic and proteomic consortia (TCGA and CPTAC). A nov-
el, multiplex MRM-based assay will be developed and analytically validated (according to established fit-for-
purpose guidelines) to quantify up to 50-100 prioritized biomarker candidates. Candidate biomarkers will be
evaluated in an existing, strongly unbiased collection of plasma samples in which plasmas were collected prior
to biopsy, compliant with PRoBE study design criteria, under an SOP from women with undiagnosed mammo-
graphic lesions. Performance of the candidate biomarkers will initially be assessed in a training set (100 cas-
es, 100 controls) to verify which candidates show a mean difference in plasma levels between cases vs con-
trols, and to test the possibility of building a multiple marker prediction model. Subsequently, individual candi-
date biomarkers (as well as a potential multiple marker prediction model) will be assessed in an independent
validation set (150 cases, 150 controls) to estimate the sensitivity and specificity of the markers/panel."

United states. It is the second leading cause of cancer-related death. The clinical diversity of
PCa is dramatic, ranging from asymptomatic disease to metastatic and fatal malignancy. One
cause of this clinical diversity is the remarkable intra- and inter-tumoural heterogeneity in
disease genomics. As a result, currently clinically-used risk-stratification strategies do not
robustly discriminate aggressive from indolent diseases, leading to systemic over- and under-
treatment. Approximately 40% of men diagnosed with PCa who seek curative treatment
undergo surgical removal of their prostate (radical prostatectomy, RP). Of these, approximately
30% are found at surgery to have disease outside their prostate (non-organ-confined, non-OC).
These men are candidates for multi-modal adjuvant treatment with chemo- and hormone-
therapy to improve outcomes. We therefore propose to tackle this problem, using fluid
biomarkers to circumvent the molecular heterogeneity of the disease. Our proposal leverages
an active and productive multi-investigator, multi-institutional proteomic collaboration to develop
biomarkers for the early detection of locally aggressive non-organ-confined disease. Our two
lead biomarkers are 1) A multiple peptide panel that discriminates OC from non-OC in EDRN
phase 2 equivalent validation (Nature Communications, in press). 2) Surface expression of CUB
Domain Containing Protein 1 on exosomes differentiates PCa aggressiveness (EDRN Phase 1
equivalent discovery, Oncotarget, 2016). We propose both validation of these targets in a
globally-unique biobank of expressed prostatic secretions, as well as novel biomarker
discovery/development strategies to extend them in the same clinical context and sample
matrix. Successful completion of our proposed studies will result in validation of at least two
biomarkers for clinical utility in separation of OC vs. non-OC disease, helping to personalize
therapy for a tumour type that afflicts 1 in 7 North American men."

This application proposes the formation of a University of Michigan (UM) EDRN Biomarker Development Lab
(BDL). Through previous EDRN BDLs, our team has characterized multiple important prostate cancer
biomarkers, most notably TMPRSS2-ETS gene fusions. Through collaboration with an EDRN Clinical
Validation Center (CVC; Dr. Sanda PI), we have developed, validated and clinically implemented Mi-Prostate
Score (MiPS), a prostate cancer early detection test incorporating urine quantification of two prostate cancer
specific transcripts—the TMPRSS2:ERG gene fusion and PCA3—with serum PSA. Introduced in our CLIA
laboratory (and now with New York State approval), MiPS helps shared decision making after PSA testing
based on individualized risk predictions of aggressive prostate cancer on biopsy. Here, using this work as a
model, we will discover and characterize aggressive prostate cancer transcriptomic biomarkers, focusing on
long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). Although lncRNA biomarker utility has been largely unexplored, we recently
characterized the lncRNA compendium (“MiTranscriptome”), identifying several prostate cancer-specific and
aggressive prostate cancer-specific lncRNAs. Supporting our proposed approach, we have performed initial
validation of the lncRNA SChLAP1 as an aggressive prostate cancer specific biomarker in tissues. Likewise,
we have developed RT-PCR based next generation sequencing (NGS) panels capable of quantifying
multiplexed transcriptomic biomarkers in archived tissue and urine. Here, in three Aims, we will nominate and
develop transcriptomic biomarkers as predictors of aggressive prostate cancer both at and prior to diagnosis.
In Aim 1, we will identify novel aggressive prostate cancer-associated transcriptomic alterations from our
MiTranscriptome analysis. We will develop single gene and multiplexed NGS assays to study these
lncRNAs/coding transcripts as aggressive prostate cancers specific biomarkers. In Aim 2 we will characterize
transcripts from Aim 1 as tissue based aggressive prostate cancer biomarkers. Following our previous
approach with SChLAP1, we will develop individual in situ hybridization assays and a multiplexed NGS panel
to characterize these transcripts in well characterized prostate cancer tissue cohorts. In Aim 3, we will
characterize transcripts identified in Aim 1 as non-invasive, urine-based aggressive prostate cancer early
detection biomarkers. Through collaboration with Hologic/Gen-Probe (our industry partner on MiPS), we will
develop and assesses the performance of individual prioritized biomarkers using their platform on our
biobanked urine samples. Additionally, using multiplexed NGS, we will also characterize the performance of a
panel of transcriptomic biomarkers as an alternative/complementary approach. As recognized by the EDRN,
novel aggressive prostate cancer specific biomarkers are urgently needed. Importantly, our approach extends
beyond prostate cancer and our BDL, and our group has actively participated in the EDRN biomarker
community and anticipates continuing work with other BDLs and CVCs to facilitate the overall EDRN mission."

5U01CA214183-05	U01CA214183	9998907	2020	Breast Cancer Detection Consortium	"Abstract
 Mammography is an early detection modality for breast cancer that is implemented
widely in the United States, has established benchmarks of performance, and in most studies
throughout the world has been demonstrated to reduce mortality due to the disease. This
relatively inexpensive x-ray imaging of the breast also provides a location that can be directly
sampled through needle biopsy which leads generally to an unambiguous pathologic diagnosis
of invasive cancer, carcinoma in situ, or benign findings. No system is perfect and
mammographic screening, particularly in the US, prompts over 1.6 million biopsies per year
detecting approximately 230,000 invasive and 60,000 non-invasive cancers for a positive
predictive value of less than 20%. There may be substantial room to improve on this and
reduce the number of biopsies but this improvement must not sacrifice detection rates so the
negative predictive value (NPV, identification of true negatives) must remain very high. In this
Biomarker Development Laboratory application, we propose to test whether a combination of
mammographic feature analysis and candidate biomarkers that we have identified can achieve
an NPV that would be acceptable to patients and providers to prevent unnecessary breast
biopsies. One of the biomarkers is a type of circulating giant cell termed “Cancer Associated
Macrophage Like” (CAML) that can only be detected using freshly drawn whole blood, we
propose to conduct a prospective trial at Duke University in women undergoing breast cancer
diagnosis. Our realistic goal is to accrue ~1000 women over the course of 4 years for which full
field digital mammography has been performed. The images will undergo feature extraction for
decision modeling. Blood will be analyzed for the presence and type of CAML cells,
immunosignaturing using the high density peptide arrays developed by Stephen Johnston at
Arizona State, and measurements of two specific analytes that have the highest sensitivity and
specificity for basal type cancers, CA125 and TP53 autoantibodies. As feature analysis from
imaging alone can achieve, at least for masses on mammography, an AUC of ~0.9, the study is
designed to determine whether the biomarkers have sufficient complementary information to the
imaging and each other to increase the AUC to 0.95 allowing us to identify a threshold where
there is a 98% NPV. We will make use of the most careful and consistent standard operating
procedures, the best candidate biomarkers, and the most well developed imaging algorithms to
make this a definitive study."

Despite advances in screening and treatment, mortalities from breast and lung cancers have remained high in
the US over the last 20 years. It is widely accepted that early detection is critical to improving outcomes in both
diseases. Both also rely on imaging for screening, but false positive and false negative detection are
associated with unnecessary biopsies, missed diagnoses, and costs. There is an urgent need for biochemical
markers that improve the performance of imaging technologies. Our laboratories have been successful at
identifying useful cancer biomarkers by exploiting patients’ own ability to produce antibodies against tumor-
associated antigens (TAA), referred to as tumor-associated autoantibodies (TAAb). With prior EDRN support,
we developed high-throughput programmable protein display methods for the rapid detection and validation of
autoantibody biomarker signatures in breast and lung cancers. Our breast cancer TAAb biomarkers have been
licensed and integrated into Videssa™ Breast that is now available as CLIA-certified test. Our triple negative
breast cancer markers have been validated in blinded phase 2 multicenter validation studies. These
demonstrate the great utility of TAAb in cancer early detection. However, the sensitivities of most TAAbs is
moderate and there is a suggestion that greater sensitivity and specificity could be obtained by examining
TAAb directed at aberrantly modified proteins in cancers. Our central hypothesis is that aberrant protein
glycosylation, a hallmark of breast and lung cancers, induces glycoprotein-specific TAAb that can be measured
as specific serum biomarkers of these cancers. Alterations in glycosylation are highly immunogenic, and there
is strong historical evidence for significant antibody responses to cancer-altered glycoproteins. However, all
current protein (or polypeptide) display tools allow limited or no post-translational modification. This historical
roadblock has prevented the identification of these biomarkers because of the lack of screening methods that
test immunogenic structural glycoproteins. We introduce a tool for the high-throughput display of full-length
proteins decorated with cancer-specific O-glycan structures. This will revolutionize the opportunity to screen
glycan-protein epitopes in their natural context. Our team comprises strong expertise in functional proteomics,
biomarker development, glycoproteomics, medical oncology and biostatistics. Targeted proteins will include:
the extra-cellular domains of relevant single pass membrane proteins, proteins known to be O-glycosylated
and overexpressed in the two cancers, and all known mucins. They will be translated in situ using human
ribosomes and chaperone proteins and then systematically decorated with Tn and STn O-GalNAc-type glycans
by consecutive addition of recombinant glycosyltransferases and sugar nucleotides to mirror what occurs in the
two cancers. Adhering to the principles of PRoBE design, we will screen these arrays with cancer patient and
control sera. Our study will focus on cancer patients and non-cancer subjects with positive imaging findings.
Study design will include Phase I discovery (arrays/ELISA) and Phase II validation using ELISA."

Ultrasensitive Detection of Tumor Specific DNA Methylation Changes for the Early Detection of
Lung Cancer 
ABSTRACT 
This proposal seeks to improve upon the management of lung cancer through detection of
tumor specific abnormal DNA methylation. Despite highly publicized advances in genomics and
proteomics, the promise of non-invasive diagnostics and personalized medicine remains largely
unrealized. Recently, comprehensive determination of genetic and epigenetic aberrations has
become a major activity in cancer research since it is well understood that these aberrations
provide clues to the process of tumorigenesis. The applicants have developed extremely
sensitive assays for the detection of hypermethylated DNA sequences. They have also
optimized the isolation and processing of circulating cell free DNA from tumors for these
sensitive methods. The comprehensive genome wide analysis of molecular changes in cancer
completed by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) has been used to identify many highly
frequent cancer specific methylation events in lung cancer that will be combined with an
integrated approach to sample processing and preparation and novel sensitive detection
strategies to provide utrasensitive detection of tumor specific changes in DNA methylation in
blood and sputum samples. With a large population based screening cohort, the Pittsburgh
Lung Screening Study, they will develop and characterize the performance of sensitive methods
for detecting cancer specific changes in DNA methylation. This molecular detection will
compliment CT screening to address the important issue of early detection of lung cancer."

stages with little chance for survival. Biomarkers are needed to (1)determine which patients have been
asbestos exposed (AE) (2) distinguish AE and non-MPM malignancies from MPM patients and (3)
determine which MPM patients are at highest risk for early recurrence or death. The EDRN
Mesothelioma Biomarker Discovery Laboratory will refine and validate three novel MPM blood/effusion
based markers (FBLN3, SOMAmer 13 classifier, HMGB1 Isoforms) and investigate whether immune-
oncologic gene expression differences in the cellular component of the circulating blood
microenvironment can stratify AE and MPM from other control cohorts. All of these in Phase I/II
discovery studies have yielded AUCs > 0.9. An in-house, novel Luminex based assay (Soma 14 NYU
MPM) consisting of 13 slow-off-rate-modified-aptamers (SOMAmers) and a newly constructed FBLN3
SOMAmer will be assembled and technically validated using identical specimens that were used to
discover these 14 analytes. Diagnostic and prognostic capabilities in both plasma and pleural effusion
will be performed with healthy, non-AE exposed, AE, MPM, and non- MPM cancer cohorts, followed by
a blinded validation in specimens provided by the Princess Margaret Cancer Center. The University of
Hawaii/Cedar Sinai Medical Center, using 202 NYU pleural effusions, will evaluate a unique, technically
validated, electrospray ionization liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry assay for HMGB1
and its isoforms to differentiate MPM from non-MPM benign and malignant effusions. The HMGB1
effusion results will be compared to those obtained with the Soma 14 NYU MPM using validation
cohorts from an approved EDRN MPM screening program in Santiago, Chile and South Glasgow
University Hospital. Finally we will refine and validate our buffy coat/PBMC MPM profile of 5 immuno-
oncology genes which in Phase II studies can separate non AE individuals vs AE individuals vs MPM with
AUCs of 1.0. These studies could lead to 3 novel platforms which individually or combined could
significantly improve chances for early diagnosis and accurate prognostication of patients with MPM."

 Tens of millions of women undergo population-based screening for breast cancer by mammography. De-
spite the life-saving potential of early detection, screening guidelines for mammography are controversial and
continue to evolve. At issue are the specificity of mammography for distinguishing benign vs cancerous le-
sions, the sensitivity of mammography in some patient populations (e.g. women with dense breasts), and con-
cerns regarding over-diagnosis (e.g. some ductal carcinoma in situ). Our ultimate clinical aim is to develop a
blood test for early detection of breast cancer that can be used in conjunction with mammography to improve
sensitivity and specificity during screening, and thus have enormous clinical impact by detecting treatable can-
cers missed by mammography (reducing mortality) and by avoiding unnecessary invasive procedures for be-
nign or non-life-threatening disease.
 Despite considerable effort, attempts to identify blood-based screening biomarkers for early detection of
breast cancer have failed, due to technological and methodological limitations. Clearly new approaches are
warranted. We are proposing a completely novel strategy, based on the initial discovery of candidate bi-
omarkers in the plasma of “avatar mice” (harboring early passage human breast cancer xenografts), and fol-
lowed by biomarker triage and validation using a novel biomarker pipeline based on a targeted form of mass
spectrometry (MS), multiple reaction monitoring (MRM). If successful, this study could provide a road map for
applying this general approach to other cancer sites, beyond breast cancer.
 Briefly, candidate circulating biomarkers identified in the avatar mouse plasma will be verified in the plasma
from the human patients and prioritized for further testing based on integrative proteo-genomic analyses using
large breast cancer datasets generated by NCI genomic and proteomic consortia (TCGA and CPTAC). A nov-
el, multiplex MRM-based assay will be developed and analytically validated (according to established fit-for-
purpose guidelines) to quantify up to 50-100 prioritized biomarker candidates. Candidate biomarkers will be
evaluated in an existing, strongly unbiased collection of plasma samples in which plasmas were collected prior
to biopsy, compliant with PRoBE study design criteria, under an SOP from women with undiagnosed mammo-
graphic lesions. Performance of the candidate biomarkers will initially be assessed in a training set (100 cas-
es, 100 controls) to verify which candidates show a mean difference in plasma levels between cases vs con-
trols, and to test the possibility of building a multiple marker prediction model. Subsequently, individual candi-

With the increasing adoption of computed tomography (CT) as a screening tool for lung cancer, methods
for identifying the small number of patients with malignant nodules from among the large number of patients
with benign CT-detected nodules is a growing and urgent clinical need. We have targeted the problem of
developing biomarkers for detecting malignant solid or part-solid nodules that are 6 – 25 mm in diameter that
are identified by screening at risk individuals or found incidentally in screen-eligible individuals. The ability to
sensitively detect lung cancer in this clinical setting could reduce many of the potentially harmful
consequences that currently arise from uncertainties about which of these indeterminate lung nodules require
the most aggressive workup. The core of our approach is the integration of molecular biomarkers measured
in non-invasively collected nasal brushes and plasma specimens together with complementary imaging and
clinical markers. On the basis of our preliminary data, we will use total RNA sequencing of both large and
small RNA to deeply characterize the cancer-associated airway-wide field of injury in nasal epithelium;
exosome-derived plasma miRNA to capture information about tumor-associated products found in the
circulation; and qualitative and quantitative imaging characteristics to capture information about the biology of
the nodule and the local environment that would otherwise only be available through direct sampling.
Further, we will be profiling these features in several unique cohorts of smokers with indeterminate nodules
detected either incidentally or by screening that represent the clinical population in which most lung cancers
are diagnosed. Our use of biorepositories that have been collected from the clinical settings in which the
biomarker would ultimately be applied, utilizing a prospective-specimen-collection, retrospective-blinded-
evaluation (PRoBE) design minimizes potential bias and improves applicability to the intended use
population. A key aspect of our biomarker development plan is a two-staged feature selection process that
will allow us to efficiently use patient cohorts to detect robustly cancer-associated molecular and imaging
features that will then be used to construct integrated cancer predictive models. The performance and
clinical utility of the resulting models will undergo preliminary validation studies at the end of the proposed
studies. This will allow us to make a GO / NO-GO decision about whether they should be subsequently
tested in larger validation trials based on a rigorous evaluation of their validity and also whether they
represent progress toward our goal of shrinking the intermediate risk category, thereby improving the
diagnostic workup of the large number of patients for whom there is currently considerable clinical
uncertainty."

 Tens of millions of women undergo population-based screening for breast cancer by mammography. De-
spite the life-saving potential of early detection, screening guidelines for mammography are controversial and
continue to evolve. At issue are the specificity of mammography for distinguishing benign vs cancerous le-
sions, the sensitivity of mammography in some patient populations (e.g. women with dense breasts), and con-
cerns regarding over-diagnosis (e.g. some ductal carcinoma in situ). Our ultimate clinical aim is to develop a
blood test for early detection of breast cancer that can be used in conjunction with mammography to improve
sensitivity and specificity during screening, and thus have enormous clinical impact by detecting treatable can-
cers missed by mammography (reducing mortality) and by avoiding unnecessary invasive procedures for be-
nign or non-life-threatening disease.
 Despite considerable effort, attempts to identify blood-based screening biomarkers for early detection of
breast cancer have failed, due to technological and methodological limitations. Clearly new approaches are
warranted. We are proposing a completely novel strategy, based on the initial discovery of candidate bi-
omarkers in the plasma of “avatar mice” (harboring early passage human breast cancer xenografts), and fol-
lowed by biomarker triage and validation using a novel biomarker pipeline based on a targeted form of mass
spectrometry (MS), multiple reaction monitoring (MRM). If successful, this study could provide a road map for
applying this general approach to other cancer sites, beyond breast cancer.
 Briefly, candidate circulating biomarkers identified in the avatar mouse plasma will be verified in the plasma
from the human patients and prioritized for further testing based on integrative proteo-genomic analyses using
large breast cancer datasets generated by NCI genomic and proteomic consortia (TCGA and CPTAC). A nov-
el, multiplex MRM-based assay will be developed and analytically validated (according to established fit-for-
purpose guidelines) to quantify up to 50-100 prioritized biomarker candidates. Candidate biomarkers will be
evaluated in an existing, strongly unbiased collection of plasma samples in which plasmas were collected prior
to biopsy, compliant with PRoBE study design criteria, under an SOP from women with undiagnosed mammo-
graphic lesions. Performance of the candidate biomarkers will initially be assessed in a training set (100 cas-
es, 100 controls) to verify which candidates show a mean difference in plasma levels between cases vs con-
trols, and to test the possibility of building a multiple marker prediction model. Subsequently, individual candi-
date biomarkers (as well as a potential multiple marker prediction model) will be assessed in an independent
validation set (150 cases, 150 controls) to estimate the sensitivity and specificity of the markers/panel."		FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER CENTER	Seattle	WA	UNITED STATES	Michael T.

Despite advances in screening and treatment, mortalities from breast and lung cancers have remained high in
the US over the last 20 years. It is widely accepted that early detection is critical to improving outcomes in both
diseases. Both also rely on imaging for screening, but false positive and false negative detection are
associated with unnecessary biopsies, missed diagnoses, and costs. There is an urgent need for biochemical
markers that improve the performance of imaging technologies. Our laboratories have been successful at
identifying useful cancer biomarkers by exploiting patients’ own ability to produce antibodies against tumor-
associated antigens (TAA), referred to as tumor-associated autoantibodies (TAAb). With prior EDRN support,
we developed high-throughput programmable protein display methods for the rapid detection and validation of
autoantibody biomarker signatures in breast and lung cancers. Our breast cancer TAAb biomarkers have been
licensed and integrated into Videssa™ Breast that is now available as CLIA-certified test. Our triple negative
breast cancer markers have been validated in blinded phase 2 multicenter validation studies. These
demonstrate the great utility of TAAb in cancer early detection. However, the sensitivities of most TAAbs is
moderate and there is a suggestion that greater sensitivity and specificity could be obtained by examining
TAAb directed at aberrantly modified proteins in cancers. Our central hypothesis is that aberrant protein
glycosylation, a hallmark of breast and lung cancers, induces glycoprotein-specific TAAb that can be measured
as specific serum biomarkers of these cancers. Alterations in glycosylation are highly immunogenic, and there
is strong historical evidence for significant antibody responses to cancer-altered glycoproteins. However, all
current protein (or polypeptide) display tools allow limited or no post-translational modification. This historical
roadblock has prevented the identification of these biomarkers because of the lack of screening methods that
test immunogenic structural glycoproteins. We introduce a tool for the high-throughput display of full-length
proteins decorated with cancer-specific O-glycan structures. This will revolutionize the opportunity to screen
glycan-protein epitopes in their natural context. Our team comprises strong expertise in functional proteomics,
biomarker development, glycoproteomics, medical oncology and biostatistics. Targeted proteins will include:
the extra-cellular domains of relevant single pass membrane proteins, proteins known to be O-glycosylated
and overexpressed in the two cancers, and all known mucins. They will be translated in situ using human
ribosomes and chaperone proteins and then systematically decorated with Tn and STn O-GalNAc-type glycans
by consecutive addition of recombinant glycosyltransferases and sugar nucleotides to mirror what occurs in the
two cancers. Adhering to the principles of PRoBE design, we will screen these arrays with cancer patient and
control sera. Our study will focus on cancer patients and non-cancer subjects with positive imaging findings.
Study design will include Phase I discovery (arrays/ELISA) and Phase II validation using ELISA."

Ultrasensitive Detection of Tumor Specific DNA Methylation Changes for the Early Detection of
Lung Cancer 
ABSTRACT 
This proposal seeks to improve upon the management of lung cancer through detection of
tumor specific abnormal DNA methylation. Despite highly publicized advances in genomics and
proteomics, the promise of non-invasive diagnostics and personalized medicine remains largely
unrealized. Recently, comprehensive determination of genetic and epigenetic aberrations has
become a major activity in cancer research since it is well understood that these aberrations
provide clues to the process of tumorigenesis. The applicants have developed extremely
sensitive assays for the detection of hypermethylated DNA sequences. They have also
optimized the isolation and processing of circulating cell free DNA from tumors for these
sensitive methods. The comprehensive genome wide analysis of molecular changes in cancer
completed by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) has been used to identify many highly
frequent cancer specific methylation events in lung cancer that will be combined with an
integrated approach to sample processing and preparation and novel sensitive detection
strategies to provide utrasensitive detection of tumor specific changes in DNA methylation in
blood and sputum samples. With a large population based screening cohort, the Pittsburgh
Lung Screening Study, they will develop and characterize the performance of sensitive methods
for detecting cancer specific changes in DNA methylation. This molecular detection will
compliment CT screening to address the important issue of early detection of lung cancer."

stages with little chance for survival. Biomarkers are needed to (1)determine which patients have been
asbestos exposed (AE) (2) distinguish AE and non-MPM malignancies from MPM patients and (3)
determine which MPM patients are at highest risk for early recurrence or death. The EDRN
Mesothelioma Biomarker Discovery Laboratory will refine and validate three novel MPM blood/effusion
based markers (FBLN3, SOMAmer 13 classifier, HMGB1 Isoforms) and investigate whether immune-
oncologic gene expression differences in the cellular component of the circulating blood
microenvironment can stratify AE and MPM from other control cohorts. All of these in Phase I/II
discovery studies have yielded AUCs > 0.9. An in-house, novel Luminex based assay (Soma 14 NYU
MPM) consisting of 13 slow-off-rate-modified-aptamers (SOMAmers) and a newly constructed FBLN3
SOMAmer will be assembled and technically validated using identical specimens that were used to
discover these 14 analytes. Diagnostic and prognostic capabilities in both plasma and pleural effusion
will be performed with healthy, non-AE exposed, AE, MPM, and non- MPM cancer cohorts, followed by
a blinded validation in specimens provided by the Princess Margaret Cancer Center. The University of
Hawaii/Cedar Sinai Medical Center, using 202 NYU pleural effusions, will evaluate a unique, technically
validated, electrospray ionization liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry assay for HMGB1
and its isoforms to differentiate MPM from non-MPM benign and malignant effusions. The HMGB1
effusion results will be compared to those obtained with the Soma 14 NYU MPM using validation
cohorts from an approved EDRN MPM screening program in Santiago, Chile and South Glasgow
University Hospital. Finally we will refine and validate our buffy coat/PBMC MPM profile of 5 immuno-
oncology genes which in Phase II studies can separate non AE individuals vs AE individuals vs MPM with
AUCs of 1.0. These studies could lead to 3 novel platforms which individually or combined could
significantly improve chances for early diagnosis and accurate prognostication of patients with MPM."

This application proposes the formation of a University of Michigan (UM) EDRN Biomarker Development Lab
(BDL). Through previous EDRN BDLs, our team has characterized multiple important prostate cancer
biomarkers, most notably TMPRSS2-ETS gene fusions. Through collaboration with an EDRN Clinical
Validation Center (CVC; Dr. Sanda PI), we have developed, validated and clinically implemented Mi-Prostate
Score (MiPS), a prostate cancer early detection test incorporating urine quantification of two prostate cancer
specific transcripts—the TMPRSS2:ERG gene fusion and PCA3—with serum PSA. Introduced in our CLIA
laboratory (and now with New York State approval), MiPS helps shared decision making after PSA testing
based on individualized risk predictions of aggressive prostate cancer on biopsy. Here, using this work as a
model, we will discover and characterize aggressive prostate cancer transcriptomic biomarkers, focusing on
long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). Although lncRNA biomarker utility has been largely unexplored, we recently
characterized the lncRNA compendium (“MiTranscriptome”), identifying several prostate cancer-specific and
aggressive prostate cancer-specific lncRNAs. Supporting our proposed approach, we have performed initial
validation of the lncRNA SChLAP1 as an aggressive prostate cancer specific biomarker in tissues. Likewise,
we have developed RT-PCR based next generation sequencing (NGS) panels capable of quantifying
multiplexed transcriptomic biomarkers in archived tissue and urine. Here, in three Aims, we will nominate and
develop transcriptomic biomarkers as predictors of aggressive prostate cancer both at and prior to diagnosis.
In Aim 1, we will identify novel aggressive prostate cancer-associated transcriptomic alterations from our
MiTranscriptome analysis. We will develop single gene and multiplexed NGS assays to study these
lncRNAs/coding transcripts as aggressive prostate cancers specific biomarkers. In Aim 2 we will characterize
transcripts from Aim 1 as tissue based aggressive prostate cancer biomarkers. Following our previous
approach with SChLAP1, we will develop individual in situ hybridization assays and a multiplexed NGS panel
to characterize these transcripts in well characterized prostate cancer tissue cohorts. In Aim 3, we will
characterize transcripts identified in Aim 1 as non-invasive, urine-based aggressive prostate cancer early
detection biomarkers. Through collaboration with Hologic/Gen-Probe (our industry partner on MiPS), we will
develop and assesses the performance of individual prioritized biomarkers using their platform on our
biobanked urine samples. Additionally, using multiplexed NGS, we will also characterize the performance of a
panel of transcriptomic biomarkers as an alternative/complementary approach. As recognized by the EDRN,
novel aggressive prostate cancer specific biomarkers are urgently needed. Importantly, our approach extends
beyond prostate cancer and our BDL, and our group has actively participated in the EDRN biomarker
community and anticipates continuing work with other BDLs and CVCs to facilitate the overall EDRN mission."

United states. It is the second leading cause of cancer-related death. The clinical diversity of
PCa is dramatic, ranging from asymptomatic disease to metastatic and fatal malignancy. One
cause of this clinical diversity is the remarkable intra- and inter-tumoural heterogeneity in
disease genomics. As a result, currently clinically-used risk-stratification strategies do not
robustly discriminate aggressive from indolent diseases, leading to systemic over- and under-
treatment. Approximately 40% of men diagnosed with PCa who seek curative treatment
undergo surgical removal of their prostate (radical prostatectomy, RP). Of these, approximately
30% are found at surgery to have disease outside their prostate (non-organ-confined, non-OC).
These men are candidates for multi-modal adjuvant treatment with chemo- and hormone-
therapy to improve outcomes. We therefore propose to tackle this problem, using fluid
biomarkers to circumvent the molecular heterogeneity of the disease. Our proposal leverages
an active and productive multi-investigator, multi-institutional proteomic collaboration to develop
biomarkers for the early detection of locally aggressive non-organ-confined disease. Our two
lead biomarkers are 1) A multiple peptide panel that discriminates OC from non-OC in EDRN
phase 2 equivalent validation (Nature Communications, in press). 2) Surface expression of CUB
Domain Containing Protein 1 on exosomes differentiates PCa aggressiveness (EDRN Phase 1
equivalent discovery, Oncotarget, 2016). We propose both validation of these targets in a
globally-unique biobank of expressed prostatic secretions, as well as novel biomarker
discovery/development strategies to extend them in the same clinical context and sample
matrix. Successful completion of our proposed studies will result in validation of at least two
biomarkers for clinical utility in separation of OC vs. non-OC disease, helping to personalize
therapy for a tumour type that afflicts 1 in 7 North American men."

With the increasing adoption of computed tomography (CT) as a screening tool for lung cancer, methods
for identifying the small number of patients with malignant nodules from among the large number of patients
with benign CT-detected nodules is a growing and urgent clinical need. We have targeted the problem of
developing biomarkers for detecting malignant solid or part-solid nodules that are 6 – 25 mm in diameter that
are identified by screening at risk individuals or found incidentally in screen-eligible individuals. The ability to
sensitively detect lung cancer in this clinical setting could reduce many of the potentially harmful
consequences that currently arise from uncertainties about which of these indeterminate lung nodules require
the most aggressive workup. The core of our approach is the integration of molecular biomarkers measured
in non-invasively collected nasal brushes and plasma specimens together with complementary imaging and
clinical markers. On the basis of our preliminary data, we will use total RNA sequencing of both large and
small RNA to deeply characterize the cancer-associated airway-wide field of injury in nasal epithelium;
exosome-derived plasma miRNA to capture information about tumor-associated products found in the
circulation; and qualitative and quantitative imaging characteristics to capture information about the biology of
the nodule and the local environment that would otherwise only be available through direct sampling.
Further, we will be profiling these features in several unique cohorts of smokers with indeterminate nodules
detected either incidentally or by screening that represent the clinical population in which most lung cancers
are diagnosed. Our use of biorepositories that have been collected from the clinical settings in which the
biomarker would ultimately be applied, utilizing a prospective-specimen-collection, retrospective-blinded-

will allow us to efficiently use patient cohorts to detect robustly cancer-associated molecular and imaging
features that will then be used to construct integrated cancer predictive models. The performance and
clinical utility of the resulting models will undergo preliminary validation studies at the end of the proposed
studies. This will allow us to make a GO / NO-GO decision about whether they should be subsequently
tested in larger validation trials based on a rigorous evaluation of their validity and also whether they
represent progress toward our goal of shrinking the intermediate risk category, thereby improving the
diagnostic workup of the large number of patients for whom there is currently considerable clinical

 Mammography is an early detection modality for breast cancer that is implemented
widely in the United States, has established benchmarks of performance, and in most studies
throughout the world has been demonstrated to reduce mortality due to the disease. This
relatively inexpensive x-ray imaging of the breast also provides a location that can be directly
sampled through needle biopsy which leads generally to an unambiguous pathologic diagnosis
of invasive cancer, carcinoma in situ, or benign findings. No system is perfect and
mammographic screening, particularly in the US, prompts over 1.6 million biopsies per year
detecting approximately 230,000 invasive and 60,000 non-invasive cancers for a positive
predictive value of less than 20%. There may be substantial room to improve on this and
reduce the number of biopsies but this improvement must not sacrifice detection rates so the
negative predictive value (NPV, identification of true negatives) must remain very high. In this
Biomarker Development Laboratory application, we propose to test whether a combination of
mammographic feature analysis and candidate biomarkers that we have identified can achieve
an NPV that would be acceptable to patients and providers to prevent unnecessary breast
biopsies. One of the biomarkers is a type of circulating giant cell termed “Cancer Associated
Macrophage Like” (CAML) that can only be detected using freshly drawn whole blood, we
propose to conduct a prospective trial at Duke University in women undergoing breast cancer
diagnosis. Our realistic goal is to accrue ~1000 women over the course of 4 years for which full
field digital mammography has been performed. The images will undergo feature extraction for
decision modeling. Blood will be analyzed for the presence and type of CAML cells,
immunosignaturing using the high density peptide arrays developed by Stephen Johnston at
Arizona State, and measurements of two specific analytes that have the highest sensitivity and
specificity for basal type cancers, CA125 and TP53 autoantibodies. As feature analysis from
imaging alone can achieve, at least for masses on mammography, an AUC of ~0.9, the study is
designed to determine whether the biomarkers have sufficient complementary information to the
imaging and each other to increase the AUC to 0.95 allowing us to identify a threshold where
there is a 98% NPV. We will make use of the most careful and consistent standard operating
procedures, the best candidate biomarkers, and the most well developed imaging algorithms to
make this a definitive study."

Ultrasensitive Detection of Tumor Specific DNA Methylation Changes for the Early Detection of
Lung Cancer 
ABSTRACT 
This proposal seeks to improve upon the management of lung cancer through detection of
tumor specific abnormal DNA methylation. Despite highly publicized advances in genomics and
proteomics, the promise of non-invasive diagnostics and personalized medicine remains largely
unrealized. Recently, comprehensive determination of genetic and epigenetic aberrations has
become a major activity in cancer research since it is well understood that these aberrations
provide clues to the process of tumorigenesis. The applicants have developed extremely
sensitive assays for the detection of hypermethylated DNA sequences. They have also
optimized the isolation and processing of circulating cell free DNA from tumors for these
sensitive methods. The comprehensive genome wide analysis of molecular changes in cancer
completed by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) has been used to identify many highly
frequent cancer specific methylation events in lung cancer that will be combined with an
integrated approach to sample processing and preparation and novel sensitive detection
strategies to provide utrasensitive detection of tumor specific changes in DNA methylation in
blood and sputum samples. With a large population based screening cohort, the Pittsburgh
Lung Screening Study, they will develop and characterize the performance of sensitive methods
for detecting cancer specific changes in DNA methylation. This molecular detection will
compliment CT screening to address the important issue of early detection of lung cancer."

5U01CA214172-03	U01CA214172	9544892	2018	A unique approach combining avatar mice and targeted mass spectrometry to identify blood biomarkers for early detection of breast cancer	"Project Summary/Abstract
 Tens of millions of women undergo population-based screening for breast cancer by mammography. De-
spite the life-saving potential of early detection, screening guidelines for mammography are controversial and
continue to evolve. At issue are the specificity of mammography for distinguishing benign vs cancerous le-
sions, the sensitivity of mammography in some patient populations (e.g. women with dense breasts), and con-
cerns regarding over-diagnosis (e.g. some ductal carcinoma in situ). Our ultimate clinical aim is to develop a
blood test for early detection of breast cancer that can be used in conjunction with mammography to improve
sensitivity and specificity during screening, and thus have enormous clinical impact by detecting treatable can-
cers missed by mammography (reducing mortality) and by avoiding unnecessary invasive procedures for be-
nign or non-life-threatening disease.
 Despite considerable effort, attempts to identify blood-based screening biomarkers for early detection of
breast cancer have failed, due to technological and methodological limitations. Clearly new approaches are
warranted. We are proposing a completely novel strategy, based on the initial discovery of candidate bi-
omarkers in the plasma of “avatar mice” (harboring early passage human breast cancer xenografts), and fol-
lowed by biomarker triage and validation using a novel biomarker pipeline based on a targeted form of mass
spectrometry (MS), multiple reaction monitoring (MRM). If successful, this study could provide a road map for
applying this general approach to other cancer sites, beyond breast cancer.
 Briefly, candidate circulating biomarkers identified in the avatar mouse plasma will be verified in the plasma
from the human patients and prioritized for further testing based on integrative proteo-genomic analyses using
large breast cancer datasets generated by NCI genomic and proteomic consortia (TCGA and CPTAC). A nov-
el, multiplex MRM-based assay will be developed and analytically validated (according to established fit-for-
purpose guidelines) to quantify up to 50-100 prioritized biomarker candidates. Candidate biomarkers will be
evaluated in an existing, strongly unbiased collection of plasma samples in which plasmas were collected prior
to biopsy, compliant with PRoBE study design criteria, under an SOP from women with undiagnosed mammo-
graphic lesions. Performance of the candidate biomarkers will initially be assessed in a training set (100 cas-
es, 100 controls) to verify which candidates show a mean difference in plasma levels between cases vs con-
trols, and to test the possibility of building a multiple marker prediction model. Subsequently, individual candi-
date biomarkers (as well as a potential multiple marker prediction model) will be assessed in an independent
validation set (150 cases, 150 controls) to estimate the sensitivity and specificity of the markers/panel."

This application proposes the formation of a University of Michigan (UM) EDRN Biomarker Development Lab
(BDL). Through previous EDRN BDLs, our team has characterized multiple important prostate cancer
biomarkers, most notably TMPRSS2-ETS gene fusions. Through collaboration with an EDRN Clinical
Validation Center (CVC; Dr. Sanda PI), we have developed, validated and clinically implemented Mi-Prostate
Score (MiPS), a prostate cancer early detection test incorporating urine quantification of two prostate cancer
specific transcripts—the TMPRSS2:ERG gene fusion and PCA3—with serum PSA. Introduced in our CLIA
laboratory (and now with New York State approval), MiPS helps shared decision making after PSA testing
based on individualized risk predictions of aggressive prostate cancer on biopsy. Here, using this work as a
model, we will discover and characterize aggressive prostate cancer transcriptomic biomarkers, focusing on
long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). Although lncRNA biomarker utility has been largely unexplored, we recently
characterized the lncRNA compendium (“MiTranscriptome”), identifying several prostate cancer-specific and
aggressive prostate cancer-specific lncRNAs. Supporting our proposed approach, we have performed initial
validation of the lncRNA SChLAP1 as an aggressive prostate cancer specific biomarker in tissues. Likewise,
we have developed RT-PCR based next generation sequencing (NGS) panels capable of quantifying
multiplexed transcriptomic biomarkers in archived tissue and urine. Here, in three Aims, we will nominate and
develop transcriptomic biomarkers as predictors of aggressive prostate cancer both at and prior to diagnosis.
In Aim 1, we will identify novel aggressive prostate cancer-associated transcriptomic alterations from our
MiTranscriptome analysis. We will develop single gene and multiplexed NGS assays to study these
lncRNAs/coding transcripts as aggressive prostate cancers specific biomarkers. In Aim 2 we will characterize
transcripts from Aim 1 as tissue based aggressive prostate cancer biomarkers. Following our previous
approach with SChLAP1, we will develop individual in situ hybridization assays and a multiplexed NGS panel
to characterize these transcripts in well characterized prostate cancer tissue cohorts. In Aim 3, we will
characterize transcripts identified in Aim 1 as non-invasive, urine-based aggressive prostate cancer early
detection biomarkers. Through collaboration with Hologic/Gen-Probe (our industry partner on MiPS), we will
develop and assesses the performance of individual prioritized biomarkers using their platform on our
biobanked urine samples. Additionally, using multiplexed NGS, we will also characterize the performance of a
panel of transcriptomic biomarkers as an alternative/complementary approach. As recognized by the EDRN,
novel aggressive prostate cancer specific biomarkers are urgently needed. Importantly, our approach extends
beyond prostate cancer and our BDL, and our group has actively participated in the EDRN biomarker
community and anticipates continuing work with other BDLs and CVCs to facilitate the overall EDRN mission."

discovery studies have yielded AUCs > 0.9. An in-house, novel Luminex based assay (Soma 14 NYU
MPM) consisting of 13 slow-off-rate-modified-aptamers (SOMAmers) and a newly constructed FBLN3
SOMAmer will be assembled and technically validated using identical specimens that were used to
discover these 14 analytes. Diagnostic and prognostic capabilities in both plasma and pleural effusion
will be performed with healthy, non-AE exposed, AE, MPM, and non- MPM cancer cohorts, followed by
a blinded validation in specimens provided by the Princess Margaret Cancer Center. The University of
Hawaii/Cedar Sinai Medical Center, using 202 NYU pleural effusions, will evaluate a unique, technically
validated, electrospray ionization liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry assay for HMGB1
and its isoforms to differentiate MPM from non-MPM benign and malignant effusions. The HMGB1
effusion results will be compared to those obtained with the Soma 14 NYU MPM using validation
cohorts from an approved EDRN MPM screening program in Santiago, Chile and South Glasgow
University Hospital. Finally we will refine and validate our buffy coat/PBMC MPM profile of 5 immuno-
oncology genes which in Phase II studies can separate non AE individuals vs AE individuals vs MPM with
AUCs of 1.0. These studies could lead to 3 novel platforms which individually or combined could
significantly improve chances for early diagnosis and accurate prognostication of patients with MPM."

Despite advances in screening and treatment, mortalities from breast and lung cancers have remained high in
the US over the last 20 years. It is widely accepted that early detection is critical to improving outcomes in both
diseases. Both also rely on imaging for screening, but false positive and false negative detection are
associated with unnecessary biopsies, missed diagnoses, and costs. There is an urgent need for biochemical
markers that improve the performance of imaging technologies. Our laboratories have been successful at
identifying useful cancer biomarkers by exploiting patients’ own ability to produce antibodies against tumor-
associated antigens (TAA), referred to as tumor-associated autoantibodies (TAAb). With prior EDRN support,
we developed high-throughput programmable protein display methods for the rapid detection and validation of
autoantibody biomarker signatures in breast and lung cancers. Our breast cancer TAAb biomarkers have been
licensed and integrated into Videssa™ Breast that is now available as CLIA-certified test. Our triple negative
breast cancer markers have been validated in blinded phase 2 multicenter validation studies. These
demonstrate the great utility of TAAb in cancer early detection. However, the sensitivities of most TAAbs is
moderate and there is a suggestion that greater sensitivity and specificity could be obtained by examining
TAAb directed at aberrantly modified proteins in cancers. Our central hypothesis is that aberrant protein
glycosylation, a hallmark of breast and lung cancers, induces glycoprotein-specific TAAb that can be measured
as specific serum biomarkers of these cancers. Alterations in glycosylation are highly immunogenic, and there
is strong historical evidence for significant antibody responses to cancer-altered glycoproteins. However, all
current protein (or polypeptide) display tools allow limited or no post-translational modification. This historical
roadblock has prevented the identification of these biomarkers because of the lack of screening methods that
test immunogenic structural glycoproteins. We introduce a tool for the high-throughput display of full-length
proteins decorated with cancer-specific O-glycan structures. This will revolutionize the opportunity to screen
glycan-protein epitopes in their natural context. Our team comprises strong expertise in functional proteomics,
biomarker development, glycoproteomics, medical oncology and biostatistics. Targeted proteins will include:
the extra-cellular domains of relevant single pass membrane proteins, proteins known to be O-glycosylated
and overexpressed in the two cancers, and all known mucins. They will be translated in situ using human
ribosomes and chaperone proteins and then systematically decorated with Tn and STn O-GalNAc-type glycans
by consecutive addition of recombinant glycosyltransferases and sugar nucleotides to mirror what occurs in the
two cancers. Adhering to the principles of PRoBE design, we will screen these arrays with cancer patient and
control sera. Our study will focus on cancer patients and non-cancer subjects with positive imaging findings.
Study design will include Phase I discovery (arrays/ELISA) and Phase II validation using ELISA."

With the increasing adoption of computed tomography (CT) as a screening tool for lung cancer, methods
for identifying the small number of patients with malignant nodules from among the large number of patients
with benign CT-detected nodules is a growing and urgent clinical need. We have targeted the problem of
developing biomarkers for detecting malignant solid or part-solid nodules that are 6 – 25 mm in diameter that
are identified by screening at risk individuals or found incidentally in screen-eligible individuals. The ability to
sensitively detect lung cancer in this clinical setting could reduce many of the potentially harmful
consequences that currently arise from uncertainties about which of these indeterminate lung nodules require
the most aggressive workup. The core of our approach is the integration of molecular biomarkers measured
in non-invasively collected nasal brushes and plasma specimens together with complementary imaging and
clinical markers. On the basis of our preliminary data, we will use total RNA sequencing of both large and
small RNA to deeply characterize the cancer-associated airway-wide field of injury in nasal epithelium;
exosome-derived plasma miRNA to capture information about tumor-associated products found in the
circulation; and qualitative and quantitative imaging characteristics to capture information about the biology of
the nodule and the local environment that would otherwise only be available through direct sampling.
Further, we will be profiling these features in several unique cohorts of smokers with indeterminate nodules
detected either incidentally or by screening that represent the clinical population in which most lung cancers
are diagnosed. Our use of biorepositories that have been collected from the clinical settings in which the
biomarker would ultimately be applied, utilizing a prospective-specimen-collection, retrospective-blinded-
evaluation (PRoBE) design minimizes potential bias and improves applicability to the intended use
population. A key aspect of our biomarker development plan is a two-staged feature selection process that
will allow us to efficiently use patient cohorts to detect robustly cancer-associated molecular and imaging
features that will then be used to construct integrated cancer predictive models. The performance and
clinical utility of the resulting models will undergo preliminary validation studies at the end of the proposed
studies. This will allow us to make a GO / NO-GO decision about whether they should be subsequently
tested in larger validation trials based on a rigorous evaluation of their validity and also whether they
represent progress toward our goal of shrinking the intermediate risk category, thereby improving the
diagnostic workup of the large number of patients for whom there is currently considerable clinical
uncertainty."

 Tens of millions of women undergo population-based screening for breast cancer by mammography. De-
spite the life-saving potential of early detection, screening guidelines for mammography are controversial and
continue to evolve. At issue are the specificity of mammography for distinguishing benign vs cancerous le-
sions, the sensitivity of mammography in some patient populations (e.g. women with dense breasts), and con-
cerns regarding over-diagnosis (e.g. some ductal carcinoma in situ). Our ultimate clinical aim is to develop a
blood test for early detection of breast cancer that can be used in conjunction with mammography to improve
sensitivity and specificity during screening, and thus have enormous clinical impact by detecting treatable can-
cers missed by mammography (reducing mortality) and by avoiding unnecessary invasive procedures for be-
nign or non-life-threatening disease.
 Despite considerable effort, attempts to identify blood-based screening biomarkers for early detection of
breast cancer have failed, due to technological and methodological limitations. Clearly new approaches are
warranted. We are proposing a completely novel strategy, based on the initial discovery of candidate bi-
omarkers in the plasma of “avatar mice” (harboring early passage human breast cancer xenografts), and fol-
lowed by biomarker triage and validation using a novel biomarker pipeline based on a targeted form of mass
spectrometry (MS), multiple reaction monitoring (MRM). If successful, this study could provide a road map for
applying this general approach to other cancer sites, beyond breast cancer.
 Briefly, candidate circulating biomarkers identified in the avatar mouse plasma will be verified in the plasma
from the human patients and prioritized for further testing based on integrative proteo-genomic analyses using
large breast cancer datasets generated by NCI genomic and proteomic consortia (TCGA and CPTAC). A nov-
el, multiplex MRM-based assay will be developed and analytically validated (according to established fit-for-
purpose guidelines) to quantify up to 50-100 prioritized biomarker candidates. Candidate biomarkers will be
evaluated in an existing, strongly unbiased collection of plasma samples in which plasmas were collected prior
to biopsy, compliant with PRoBE study design criteria, under an SOP from women with undiagnosed mammo-
graphic lesions. Performance of the candidate biomarkers will initially be assessed in a training set (100 cas-
es, 100 controls) to verify which candidates show a mean difference in plasma levels between cases vs con-
trols, and to test the possibility of building a multiple marker prediction model. Subsequently, individual candi-
date biomarkers (as well as a potential multiple marker prediction model) will be assessed in an independent
validation set (150 cases, 150 controls) to estimate the sensitivity and specificity of the markers/panel."

 Mammography is an early detection modality for breast cancer that is implemented
widely in the United States, has established benchmarks of performance, and in most studies
throughout the world has been demonstrated to reduce mortality due to the disease. This
relatively inexpensive x-ray imaging of the breast also provides a location that can be directly
sampled through needle biopsy which leads generally to an unambiguous pathologic diagnosis
of invasive cancer, carcinoma in situ, or benign findings. No system is perfect and
mammographic screening, particularly in the US, prompts over 1.6 million biopsies per year
detecting approximately 230,000 invasive and 60,000 non-invasive cancers for a positive
predictive value of less than 20%. There may be substantial room to improve on this and
reduce the number of biopsies but this improvement must not sacrifice detection rates so the
negative predictive value (NPV, identification of true negatives) must remain very high. In this
Biomarker Development Laboratory application, we propose to test whether a combination of
mammographic feature analysis and candidate biomarkers that we have identified can achieve
an NPV that would be acceptable to patients and providers to prevent unnecessary breast
biopsies. One of the biomarkers is a type of circulating giant cell termed “Cancer Associated
Macrophage Like” (CAML) that can only be detected using freshly drawn whole blood, we
propose to conduct a prospective trial at Duke University in women undergoing breast cancer
diagnosis. Our realistic goal is to accrue ~1000 women over the course of 4 years for which full
field digital mammography has been performed. The images will undergo feature extraction for
decision modeling. Blood will be analyzed for the presence and type of CAML cells,
immunosignaturing using the high density peptide arrays developed by Stephen Johnston at
Arizona State, and measurements of two specific analytes that have the highest sensitivity and
specificity for basal type cancers, CA125 and TP53 autoantibodies. As feature analysis from
imaging alone can achieve, at least for masses on mammography, an AUC of ~0.9, the study is
designed to determine whether the biomarkers have sufficient complementary information to the
imaging and each other to increase the AUC to 0.95 allowing us to identify a threshold where
there is a 98% NPV. We will make use of the most careful and consistent standard operating
procedures, the best candidate biomarkers, and the most well developed imaging algorithms to
make this a definitive study."

Ultrasensitive Detection of Tumor Specific DNA Methylation Changes for the Early Detection of
Lung Cancer 
ABSTRACT 
This proposal seeks to improve upon the management of lung cancer through detection of
tumor specific abnormal DNA methylation. Despite highly publicized advances in genomics and
proteomics, the promise of non-invasive diagnostics and personalized medicine remains largely
unrealized. Recently, comprehensive determination of genetic and epigenetic aberrations has
become a major activity in cancer research since it is well understood that these aberrations
provide clues to the process of tumorigenesis. The applicants have developed extremely
sensitive assays for the detection of hypermethylated DNA sequences. They have also
optimized the isolation and processing of circulating cell free DNA from tumors for these
sensitive methods. The comprehensive genome wide analysis of molecular changes in cancer
completed by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) has been used to identify many highly
frequent cancer specific methylation events in lung cancer that will be combined with an
integrated approach to sample processing and preparation and novel sensitive detection
strategies to provide utrasensitive detection of tumor specific changes in DNA methylation in
blood and sputum samples. With a large population based screening cohort, the Pittsburgh
Lung Screening Study, they will develop and characterize the performance of sensitive methods
for detecting cancer specific changes in DNA methylation. This molecular detection will
compliment CT screening to address the important issue of early detection of lung cancer."

determine which MPM patients are at highest risk for early recurrence or death. The EDRN
Mesothelioma Biomarker Discovery Laboratory will refine and validate three novel MPM blood/effusion
based markers (FBLN3, SOMAmer 13 classifier, HMGB1 Isoforms) and investigate whether immune-
oncologic gene expression differences in the cellular component of the circulating blood
microenvironment can stratify AE and MPM from other control cohorts. All of these in Phase I/II

MPM) consisting of 13 slow-off-rate-modified-aptamers (SOMAmers) and a newly constructed FBLN3
SOMAmer will be assembled and technically validated using identical specimens that were used to
discover these 14 analytes. Diagnostic and prognostic capabilities in both plasma and pleural effusion
will be performed with healthy, non-AE exposed, AE, MPM, and non- MPM cancer cohorts, followed by
a blinded validation in specimens provided by the Princess Margaret Cancer Center. The University of
Hawaii/Cedar Sinai Medical Center, using 202 NYU pleural effusions, will evaluate a unique, technically
validated, electrospray ionization liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry assay for HMGB1
and its isoforms to differentiate MPM from non-MPM benign and malignant effusions. The HMGB1
effusion results will be compared to those obtained with the Soma 14 NYU MPM using validation
cohorts from an approved EDRN MPM screening program in Santiago, Chile and South Glasgow
University Hospital. Finally we will refine and validate our buffy coat/PBMC MPM profile of 5 immuno-
oncology genes which in Phase II studies can separate non AE individuals vs AE individuals vs MPM with
AUCs of 1.0. These studies could lead to 3 novel platforms which individually or combined could
significantly improve chances for early diagnosis and accurate prognostication of patients with MPM."

This application proposes the formation of a University of Michigan (UM) EDRN Biomarker Development Lab

biomarkers, most notably TMPRSS2-ETS gene fusions. Through collaboration with an EDRN Clinical
Validation Center (CVC; Dr. Sanda PI), we have developed, validated and clinically implemented Mi-Prostate

based on individualized risk predictions of aggressive prostate cancer on biopsy. Here, using this work as a

long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). Although lncRNA biomarker utility has been largely unexplored, we recently
characterized the lncRNA compendium (“MiTranscriptome”), identifying several prostate cancer-specific and

we have developed RT-PCR based next generation sequencing (NGS) panels capable of quantifying

5U01CA214201-02	U01CA214201	9355593	2017	Novel approaches to study immune responses to post translational modifications for cancer detection	"Project Summary/Abstract
Despite advances in screening and treatment, mortalities from breast and lung cancers have remained high in
the US over the last 20 years. It is widely accepted that early detection is critical to improving outcomes in both
diseases. Both also rely on imaging for screening, but false positive and false negative detection are
associated with unnecessary biopsies, missed diagnoses, and costs. There is an urgent need for biochemical
markers that improve the performance of imaging technologies. Our laboratories have been successful at
identifying useful cancer biomarkers by exploiting patients’ own ability to produce antibodies against tumor-
associated antigens (TAA), referred to as tumor-associated autoantibodies (TAAb). With prior EDRN support,
we developed high-throughput programmable protein display methods for the rapid detection and validation of
autoantibody biomarker signatures in breast and lung cancers. Our breast cancer TAAb biomarkers have been
licensed and integrated into Videssa™ Breast that is now available as CLIA-certified test. Our triple negative
breast cancer markers have been validated in blinded phase 2 multicenter validation studies. These
demonstrate the great utility of TAAb in cancer early detection. However, the sensitivities of most TAAbs is
moderate and there is a suggestion that greater sensitivity and specificity could be obtained by examining
TAAb directed at aberrantly modified proteins in cancers. Our central hypothesis is that aberrant protein
glycosylation, a hallmark of breast and lung cancers, induces glycoprotein-specific TAAb that can be measured
as specific serum biomarkers of these cancers. Alterations in glycosylation are highly immunogenic, and there
is strong historical evidence for significant antibody responses to cancer-altered glycoproteins. However, all
current protein (or polypeptide) display tools allow limited or no post-translational modification. This historical
roadblock has prevented the identification of these biomarkers because of the lack of screening methods that
test immunogenic structural glycoproteins. We introduce a tool for the high-throughput display of full-length
proteins decorated with cancer-specific O-glycan structures. This will revolutionize the opportunity to screen
glycan-protein epitopes in their natural context. Our team comprises strong expertise in functional proteomics,
biomarker development, glycoproteomics, medical oncology and biostatistics. Targeted proteins will include:
the extra-cellular domains of relevant single pass membrane proteins, proteins known to be O-glycosylated
and overexpressed in the two cancers, and all known mucins. They will be translated in situ using human
ribosomes and chaperone proteins and then systematically decorated with Tn and STn O-GalNAc-type glycans
by consecutive addition of recombinant glycosyltransferases and sugar nucleotides to mirror what occurs in the
two cancers. Adhering to the principles of PRoBE design, we will screen these arrays with cancer patient and
control sera. Our study will focus on cancer patients and non-cancer subjects with positive imaging findings.
Study design will include Phase I discovery (arrays/ELISA) and Phase II validation using ELISA."

United states. It is the second leading cause of cancer-related death. The clinical diversity of
PCa is dramatic, ranging from asymptomatic disease to metastatic and fatal malignancy. One
cause of this clinical diversity is the remarkable intra- and inter-tumoural heterogeneity in
disease genomics. As a result, currently clinically-used risk-stratification strategies do not
robustly discriminate aggressive from indolent diseases, leading to systemic over- and under-
treatment. Approximately 40% of men diagnosed with PCa who seek curative treatment
undergo surgical removal of their prostate (radical prostatectomy, RP). Of these, approximately
30% are found at surgery to have disease outside their prostate (non-organ-confined, non-OC).
These men are candidates for multi-modal adjuvant treatment with chemo- and hormone-
therapy to improve outcomes. We therefore propose to tackle this problem, using fluid
biomarkers to circumvent the molecular heterogeneity of the disease. Our proposal leverages
an active and productive multi-investigator, multi-institutional proteomic collaboration to develop
biomarkers for the early detection of locally aggressive non-organ-confined disease. Our two
lead biomarkers are 1) A multiple peptide panel that discriminates OC from non-OC in EDRN
phase 2 equivalent validation (Nature Communications, in press). 2) Surface expression of CUB
Domain Containing Protein 1 on exosomes differentiates PCa aggressiveness (EDRN Phase 1
equivalent discovery, Oncotarget, 2016). We propose both validation of these targets in a
globally-unique biobank of expressed prostatic secretions, as well as novel biomarker
discovery/development strategies to extend them in the same clinical context and sample
matrix. Successful completion of our proposed studies will result in validation of at least two
biomarkers for clinical utility in separation of OC vs. non-OC disease, helping to personalize
therapy for a tumour type that afflicts 1 in 7 North American men."

Ultrasensitive Detection of Tumor Specific DNA Methylation Changes for the Early Detection of
Lung Cancer 
ABSTRACT 
This proposal seeks to improve upon the management of lung cancer through detection of
tumor specific abnormal DNA methylation. Despite highly publicized advances in genomics and
proteomics, the promise of non-invasive diagnostics and personalized medicine remains largely
unrealized. Recently, comprehensive determination of genetic and epigenetic aberrations has
become a major activity in cancer research since it is well understood that these aberrations
provide clues to the process of tumorigenesis. The applicants have developed extremely
sensitive assays for the detection of hypermethylated DNA sequences. They have also
optimized the isolation and processing of circulating cell free DNA from tumors for these
sensitive methods. The comprehensive genome wide analysis of molecular changes in cancer
completed by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) has been used to identify many highly
frequent cancer specific methylation events in lung cancer that will be combined with an
integrated approach to sample processing and preparation and novel sensitive detection
strategies to provide utrasensitive detection of tumor specific changes in DNA methylation in
blood and sputum samples. With a large population based screening cohort, the Pittsburgh
Lung Screening Study, they will develop and characterize the performance of sensitive methods
for detecting cancer specific changes in DNA methylation. This molecular detection will
compliment CT screening to address the important issue of early detection of lung cancer."

With the increasing adoption of computed tomography (CT) as a screening tool for lung cancer, methods
for identifying the small number of patients with malignant nodules from among the large number of patients
with benign CT-detected nodules is a growing and urgent clinical need. We have targeted the problem of
developing biomarkers for detecting malignant solid or part-solid nodules that are 6 – 25 mm in diameter that
are identified by screening at risk individuals or found incidentally in screen-eligible individuals. The ability to
sensitively detect lung cancer in this clinical setting could reduce many of the potentially harmful
consequences that currently arise from uncertainties about which of these indeterminate lung nodules require
the most aggressive workup. The core of our approach is the integration of molecular biomarkers measured
in non-invasively collected nasal brushes and plasma specimens together with complementary imaging and
clinical markers. On the basis of our preliminary data, we will use total RNA sequencing of both large and
small RNA to deeply characterize the cancer-associated airway-wide field of injury in nasal epithelium;
exosome-derived plasma miRNA to capture information about tumor-associated products found in the
circulation; and qualitative and quantitative imaging characteristics to capture information about the biology of
the nodule and the local environment that would otherwise only be available through direct sampling.
Further, we will be profiling these features in several unique cohorts of smokers with indeterminate nodules
detected either incidentally or by screening that represent the clinical population in which most lung cancers
are diagnosed. Our use of biorepositories that have been collected from the clinical settings in which the
biomarker would ultimately be applied, utilizing a prospective-specimen-collection, retrospective-blinded-
evaluation (PRoBE) design minimizes potential bias and improves applicability to the intended use
population. A key aspect of our biomarker development plan is a two-staged feature selection process that
will allow us to efficiently use patient cohorts to detect robustly cancer-associated molecular and imaging
features that will then be used to construct integrated cancer predictive models. The performance and
clinical utility of the resulting models will undergo preliminary validation studies at the end of the proposed
studies. This will allow us to make a GO / NO-GO decision about whether they should be subsequently
tested in larger validation trials based on a rigorous evaluation of their validity and also whether they
represent progress toward our goal of shrinking the intermediate risk category, thereby improving the
diagnostic workup of the large number of patients for whom there is currently considerable clinical
uncertainty."

 Mammography is an early detection modality for breast cancer that is implemented
widely in the United States, has established benchmarks of performance, and in most studies
throughout the world has been demonstrated to reduce mortality due to the disease. This
relatively inexpensive x-ray imaging of the breast also provides a location that can be directly
sampled through needle biopsy which leads generally to an unambiguous pathologic diagnosis
of invasive cancer, carcinoma in situ, or benign findings. No system is perfect and
mammographic screening, particularly in the US, prompts over 1.6 million biopsies per year
detecting approximately 230,000 invasive and 60,000 non-invasive cancers for a positive
predictive value of less than 20%. There may be substantial room to improve on this and
reduce the number of biopsies but this improvement must not sacrifice detection rates so the
negative predictive value (NPV, identification of true negatives) must remain very high. In this
Biomarker Development Laboratory application, we propose to test whether a combination of
mammographic feature analysis and candidate biomarkers that we have identified can achieve
an NPV that would be acceptable to patients and providers to prevent unnecessary breast
biopsies. One of the biomarkers is a type of circulating giant cell termed “Cancer Associated
Macrophage Like” (CAML) that can only be detected using freshly drawn whole blood, we
propose to conduct a prospective trial at Duke University in women undergoing breast cancer
diagnosis. Our realistic goal is to accrue ~1000 women over the course of 4 years for which full
field digital mammography has been performed. The images will undergo feature extraction for
decision modeling. Blood will be analyzed for the presence and type of CAML cells,
immunosignaturing using the high density peptide arrays developed by Stephen Johnston at
Arizona State, and measurements of two specific analytes that have the highest sensitivity and
specificity for basal type cancers, CA125 and TP53 autoantibodies. As feature analysis from
imaging alone can achieve, at least for masses on mammography, an AUC of ~0.9, the study is
designed to determine whether the biomarkers have sufficient complementary information to the
imaging and each other to increase the AUC to 0.95 allowing us to identify a threshold where
there is a 98% NPV. We will make use of the most careful and consistent standard operating
procedures, the best candidate biomarkers, and the most well developed imaging algorithms to
make this a definitive study."

1U01CA214172-01	U01CA214172	9277686	2016	A unique approach combining avatar mice and targeted mass spectrometry to identify blood biomarkers for early detection of breast cancer	"Project Summary/Abstract
 Tens of millions of women undergo population-based screening for breast cancer by mammography. De-
spite the life-saving potential of early detection, screening guidelines for mammography are controversial and
continue to evolve. At issue are the specificity of mammography for distinguishing benign vs cancerous le-
sions, the sensitivity of mammography in some patient populations (e.g. women with dense breasts), and con-
cerns regarding over-diagnosis (e.g. some ductal carcinoma in situ). Our ultimate clinical aim is to develop a
blood test for early detection of breast cancer that can be used in conjunction with mammography to improve
sensitivity and specificity during screening, and thus have enormous clinical impact by detecting treatable can-
cers missed by mammography (reducing mortality) and by avoiding unnecessary invasive procedures for be-
nign or non-life-threatening disease.
 Despite considerable effort, attempts to identify blood-based screening biomarkers for early detection of
breast cancer have failed, due to technological and methodological limitations. Clearly new approaches are
warranted. We are proposing a completely novel strategy, based on the initial discovery of candidate bi-
omarkers in the plasma of “avatar mice” (harboring early passage human breast cancer xenografts), and fol-
lowed by biomarker triage and validation using a novel biomarker pipeline based on a targeted form of mass
spectrometry (MS), multiple reaction monitoring (MRM). If successful, this study could provide a road map for
applying this general approach to other cancer sites, beyond breast cancer.
 Briefly, candidate circulating biomarkers identified in the avatar mouse plasma will be verified in the plasma
from the human patients and prioritized for further testing based on integrative proteo-genomic analyses using
large breast cancer datasets generated by NCI genomic and proteomic consortia (TCGA and CPTAC). A nov-
el, multiplex MRM-based assay will be developed and analytically validated (according to established fit-for-
purpose guidelines) to quantify up to 50-100 prioritized biomarker candidates. Candidate biomarkers will be
evaluated in an existing, strongly unbiased collection of plasma samples in which plasmas were collected prior
to biopsy, compliant with PRoBE study design criteria, under an SOP from women with undiagnosed mammo-
graphic lesions. Performance of the candidate biomarkers will initially be assessed in a training set (100 cas-
es, 100 controls) to verify which candidates show a mean difference in plasma levels between cases vs con-
trols, and to test the possibility of building a multiple marker prediction model. Subsequently, individual candi-
date biomarkers (as well as a potential multiple marker prediction model) will be assessed in an independent
validation set (150 cases, 150 controls) to estimate the sensitivity and specificity of the markers/panel."
