1U54CA274329-01	U54CA274329	10518243	2022	Pancreatic Cancer ARTNet Center	"Abstract
Pancreatic cancer patients show an extremely poor prognosis, which is at least in part due to poor response to
the current standard-of-care chemotherapies. While pancreatic tumors present an inadequate response to
chemotherapy, exposure to chemotherapy leads to development of acquired resistance. The response and
resistance to chemotherapies are modulated by signaling and metabolic alterations in tumor cells and companion
changes in the immune and non-immune stroma. Major advances in (a) understanding signaling responses of
cancer cells and stroma to therapy, (b) understanding metabolic adaptations to signaling and environmental
stressors, (c) development of novel therapeutic combinations to improve long-term response to current
standards-of-care chemotherapies, and (d) coordinating research/translation efforts by NCI leadership, will
provide unparalleled advances in targeting/preventing acquired therapy resistance. The ARTNet Center for
Pancreatic Cancer (ACPC) intends to achieve these objectives through an integrated research theme that
combined investigations into the metabolic and signaling mediators of acquired resistance in tumor cells and
stromal remodeling in pancreatic cancer will lead to novel effective therapies to improve the patient prognosis.
Research within ACPC will be fostered through sound guidance from leadership, IAC, EAC, ARTNet network
and NCI program. The overall goal of the Center is to study innovative hypothesis-driven mechanisms of
metabolic and signaling alterations in tumor cells and tumor-stromal metabolic crosstalk that contribute to
acquired therapy resistance in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). We hypothesize that our unique
leadership team, outstanding expertise of project and core leaders, singular set of technological capabilities and
resources, operational design, and strong institutional support of the ACPC will drive transformative advances
in the acquired therapy resistance field that will be in alignment with the other ARTNet members and NCIâ€™s
mission for the program. Providing novel insights into the mechanistic aspects of the signaling and metabolic
mechanisms, the proposed basic and translational studies will ultimately drive the development of novel
therapeutic combinations that can change the clinical course of cancer therapy. This will be achieved through
the following Specific Aims: Aim 1. Investigate novel mechanisms of acquired resistance at the interface of tumor-
stromal metabolic cross talk and examine the preclinical efficacy of identified targets to improve the therapeutic
response against pancreatic cancer. Aim 2. Provide robust and innovative toolsets and resources to investigate
and validated mechanisms of acquired therapy resistance. Aim 3. Facilitate a systems-level mechanistic
understanding of acquired therapy resistance mechanisms."

1U54CA274220-01	U54CA274220	10517140	2022	Acquired Resistance to Therapy and Iron (ARTI) Center	"Overall Summary
Approximately 50% of cancer patients are treated with radiation therapy (RT), but local recurrence can still occur
even with the use of advanced RT techniques. This local recurrence, which commonly develops in 30-50% of
cancer cases, is exacerbated by the acquisition of RT resistance. This RT resistance is especially true for
patients with locally advanced thoracic cancers, such as lung and esophageal cancers. RT can lead to an iron-
dependent cell death modality, called ferroptosis, but whether ferroptosis resistance occurs within tumors giving
rise to acquired RT resistance is not known and is the central theme of the proposed Acquired Resistance to
Therapy and Iron (ARTI) Center. The overarching goals of the ARTI Center are: 1) to bridge the basic science
mechanisms of ferroptosis in acquired resistance with translational research in preclinical models and human
patient samples; 2) to identify cohorts of patients who are at greatest risk to develop acquired RT resistance;
and 3) to investigate the ability of novel therapeutic agents to re-sensitize lung and esophageal cancer cells to
radiation by inducing ferroptosis. The ARTI Center comprises two basic/mechanistic projects (Project 1 and
Project 2), one preclinical/translational project (Project 3), and one shared resource core (Molecular Imaging
Core [MIC]). Project 1 will focus on elucidating whether ferroptosis evasion is a key driver in acquired RT
resistance using radioresistant lung cancer and esophageal cancer cell lines and xenograft models that will be
used in Project 2. Project 2 will test the hypothesis that hypoxia, a long-recognized driver of tumor
radioresistance, suppresses ferroptosis induction during RT and contributes to RT-induced acquired resistance
to ferroptosis. Furthermore, expression of hypoxia-related genes and other targets of acquired RT resistance will
be analyzed by single-cell sequencing in Project 3. Project 3 investigates changes in immune cells in the tumor
microenvironment of humanized tumor models derived from chemoradiation therapy-responsive or -non-
responsive esophageal adenocarcinoma patients. These ferroptosis-mediated immunologic changes in the
tumor microenvironment may serve as prognostic biomarkers for identifying tumors that may acquire RT
resistance and predicting cancer patient outcomes, which could, in the future, be modulated by the ferroptosis-
inducing agents tested in Projects 1 and 2. Projects 1, 2, and 3 will be supported by the MIC that utilizes
bioluminescence imaging to monitor tumor growth, positron emission tomography (PET) tracers to monitor
cystine transporter activity and to identify hypoxic regions within tumors, as well as novel, redox-tuned PET
tracers for identifying activated innate immune cells. The ARTI Center will develop an Administrative Core for
effective communication and collaboration between the ARTI Center Project and Core Leaders and Co-Leaders
with National Cancer Institute (NCI) of Acquired Resistance to Therapy Network (ARTNet) program staff as well
as other ARTNet centers to synergize ARTI Center-related activities."

2U54CA224019-05	U54CA224019	10517757	2022	Architecture and Trajectory of Acquired Resistance to Therapy in AML	"PROJECT SUMMARY: Overall
The long-term goal of this Program is to define mechanisms of acquired drug resistance in acute myeloid
leukemia (AML) so that novel drug combinations can be deployed to prevent disease relapse and improve patient
outcomes. The overall five-year survival rate for AML remains 20%, an outcome that has not changed for several
decades. Although seven new regimens have been approved for AML in recent years, the improved initial
remission rates with these therapies do not lead to durable outcomes. Disease relapse is fueled by a complex
cross-talk of tumor cells adapting with support from the bone marrow microenvironment. The investigators of this
proposed ARTNet Center have collaborated for 15+ years, including as a Center in the DRSN consortium â€“ the
predecessor to ARTNet. Our prior work has involved development of the largest-to-date functional genomic
dataset on AML patient samples, genome-wide CRISPR screens, broad studies of AML interactions with stromal
and immune cells, and testing of diverse drug combinations. These studies have led to >150 collaborative
publications, continuous collaborative funding for 15+ years, creation of numerous large datasets deposited into
public repositories, and translation of findings into numerous clinical trials. Our overarching hypothesis is that
the architecture of acquired drug resistance is governed by temporal extrinsic and intrinsic factors and
elucidating this trajectory will allow for the identification of properly timed therapeutic strategies to stave
off acquired resistance and stay ahead of tumor evolution and adaptation. This hypothesis will be tested
through three well integrated Projects addressing the following questions: 1) How does AML tumor cell intrinsic
biology adapt to evade therapeutic pressure? We will use genome-wide CRISPR platforms as well as long-term
progenitor expansion of primary AML patient samples to understand feedback pathways and shifting epigenetic
and cell state landscapes that can drive acquired drug resistance. 2) How does the stromal and immune
microenvironment govern drug resistance? We will use co-culture and advanced bone marrow models to perform
genome-wide screens and test the impact of single-agents on AML-microenvironment cross-talk. Through
computational modeling, we will nominate targeting strategies to mitigate tumor extrinsic resistance signals and
boost immune anti-tumor responses. 3) How can resistance signatures and drug combinations be effectively
clinically translated? We will use high-throughput and advanced, engineered models of human bone marrow to
test and prioritize drug combinations from targets in Projects 1 and 2. We will also study longitudinal specimens
from patients enrolled on ongoing clinical trials. All of these data will inform and refine the work of Projects 1 and
2. Our Center will be supported by an Administrative Core and a Functional Phenotyping Core. Collectively, we
will develop a comprehensive understanding of acquired drug resistance in AML and identify new regimens to
treat patients at the earliest possible stage, prevent relapse, and achieve durable remissions."

is to characterize the mechanisms of, and therapeutically counteract, acquired resistance to molecular therapies
in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) by delineating the tumor-tumor microenvironment (TME) ecosystem and
its plasticity during treatment. Acquired resistance is defined as tumor progression that occurs during therapy
and after an initial tumor response. The overarching hypothesis is that acquired resistance to molecular therapies
can be thwarted by defining and exploiting vulnerabilities in the cellular, signaling, and geographic tumor
ecosystem networks that allow tumors to survive and grow during therapy. In lung cancer and other cancer types,
the use of targeted therapies that inhibit important and common oncogenic driver alterations such as mutant
EGFR and KRAS (G12C) and block immunosuppressive checkpoints such as PD1/PDL1 is improving patient
outcomes. A major challenge to transforming cancers into chronic or curable diseases is acquired resistance,
which enables lethal cancer progression in patients. Understanding the mechanisms underlying acquired
resistance is essential to develop counteracting strategies that improve patient survival. During the prior NCI
U54 DRSC funding period, our team uncovered several mechanisms of acquired resistance to targeted therapy
in human NSCLC by studying clinical specimens and innovative patient-derived models including humanized
murine models bearing patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) and patient-derived organoids (PDOs) with an intact
TME. Our expert team proposes to investigate these mechanisms, and identify others, synergistically and
iteratively via 3 Research Projects and optimal interactions with 2 Cores. A Data Science Core will analyze,
harmonize, centralize, and share data obtained across the basic and translational continuum using innovative
methods. An Administrative Core will ensure optimal project integration and internal and external interactions
with the ARTNet Consortium, and scientific and lay communities. Project 1 (Clinical tumor-TME acquired
resistance) is translational and uses clinical specimens and patient-derived models to test the hypothesis that
tumor macrophages and tumor fibroblasts promote acquired resistance via paracrine signaling interactions
including cytokine, CD47, and extracellular matrix (ECM) cues sensed by cancer cells and converging on survival
pathways such as YAP and NF-kB. Project 2 (PDX tumor-TME acquired resistance) is translational and uses
humanized mouse models to test the hypothesis that an immune-suppressive TME and activation of macrophage
and fibroblast signaling circuits that support tumor cell survival via PDK1, YAP, and NF-kB signaling promote
acquired resistance. Project 3 (PDO tumor-TME acquired resistance) is basic and uses synthetic lethal and
proteomic profiling in PDOs with a TME to test the hypothesis that signaling interactions involving the ECM,
TROP2, and CD47 promote acquired resistance. Synergistic, iterative interactions to study these mechanisms
across projects and systems will yield robust, translatable treatment strategies to counteract acquired resistance."

 Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) remains a leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide
with ~500,000 cases/year. Cisplatin is the gold standard systemic agent for HNSCC. Cisplatin resistance, both
intrinsic and acquired, has been described in preclinical models and is frequently encountered in clinical practice;
when it occurs it is deadly. The overarching goal of H-CARR is to develop a robust biological understanding
of the key drivers of cisplatin resistance in HNSCC and develop the means of detecting it early in development
and overcoming it once it arises. We previously showed that: 1) cellular processing of cisplatin generated
metabolic stress is a critical driver of sensitivity and/or resistance and 2) coordinated genomic (TP53 mutation)
and transcriptomic (Nrf-2 activation) reprogramming is essential to organizing the metabolic response to cisplatin
generated stress. H-CARR brings together our biological and metabolic models of cisplatin resistance and our
translational capabilities to image tumor metabolism non-invasively and detect biological shifts using circulating
tumor cells (CTCs), to provide a comprehensive window into acquisition of cisplatin resistance as outlined in the
Projects listed below, supported by a robust administrative and analytical infrastructure organized into 3 Cores.
Project 1 will use state of the art metabolomic studies to identify the critical metabolic dependencies of
cisplatin resistant HNSCC, identify opportunities for effective metabolic inhibition and improve our understanding
of the cross-talk between the acquisition of cisplatin resistance and modulation of the tumor immune
microenvironment. Project 2 will explore the genomic and transcriptomic reprogramming required to sustain the
metabolic shifts which accompany development of resistance and interrogate how Nrf-2 dependent and
independent signaling drives resistance and enhanced distant metastasis through intrinsic cellular mechanisms
and paracrine signaling between tumor cells and adrenergic neurons. Project 3 will test whether the metabolic
reprogramming outlined in Project 1 is detectable via non-invasive imaging (hyperpolarized magnetic resonance
imaging) and whether the biological shifts outlined in Project 2 due to clonal extinction and expansion can be
detected using CTC analysis in patients undergoing cisplatin-based treatment.
 H-CARR has the potential to realize the full clinical utility of cisplatin by identifying acquisition of
resistance early during treatment and developing the means to overcome this and associated phenotypes such
as enhanced distant metastasis. Successful completion of the proposed experiments will generate the new
clinical standard for precision oncology approaches to clinical utilization of cisplatin in HNSCC and related upper-
aerodigestive tract cancers of the lung and esophagus and therefore have a major impact on cancer survival
worldwide."

The goal of our proposed Coordinating and Data Management Center (CDMC) application is to coordinate the
activities across the Acquired Resistance to Therapy Network (ARTNet), and to manage, integrate and
disseminate the data and resources generated through the network. Leveraging cutting-edge multi-disciplinary
team approaches, we will support the ARTNet to inform new strategies that can be better translated to overcome
significant challenges in acquired resistance to cancer therapies. Our strategy is to enhance the productivity of
ARTNet investigators by fostering a collaborative and supportive research community, accelerate the progress
of ARTNet research by reducing barriers to accessing analytical expertise, ensure the reproducibility of ARTNet
data by deploying best practices for data acquisition and harmonization, and unleash the full potential of ARTNet
activities by developing enhanced tools to enable resource sharing to the broader scientific community.
First, we will provide a centralized administrative infrastructure to coordinate ARTNet activities, building upon
our well-functioning infrastructure that currently coordinates network studies under the umbrella of the NCI
Cancer Moonshot initiatives. Second, we will actively promote the ARTNet and engage in trans-consortium
interactions, where we will leverage our demonstrable experience in Cross-Moonshot outreach and
Bioconductorâ€™s decades-long record in community engagement. Third, we will provide multidisciplinary analytical
expertise to support ARTNet collaborative research, leveraging five of Roswell Park CCSGâ€™s shared resources:
Biostatistics, Bioinformatics, Biomedical Informatics, Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics, and Data Bank and
BioRepository. Our analytical support will be provided at no cost to ARTNet investigators in need of analytical
expertise, based on collaboration, transparency, and sharing. Fourth, we will develop improved data integration
software and workflows to enhance ARTNetâ€™s research capacity, capitalizing on our extensive track-record in
developing NIH-supported Moonshot, Bioconductor and AnVIL ecosystems.
The main deliverables from the proposed aims will be administrative and outreach support to coordinate
network activities, facilitate network collaboration, and engage in interaction with the broader community (Aim
1); polices and infrastructures to ensure that all resources generated by the ARTNet will be findable in a
centralized virtual resource sharing repository, and that all resources will be shared with the broader scientific
community (Aim 2); workflows to ensure that all data generated by the ARTNet will be harmonized using
standards interoperable with the broader cancer data ecosystem, analysis tools to integrate ARTNet data and
facilitate cross-study analysis within and beyond the ARTNet, and multidisciplinary analytical supports to
accelerate ARTNet research progress.(Aim 3)."
