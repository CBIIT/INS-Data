5U24CA163056-11	U24CA163056	10124296	2021	Barrett's Esophagus Translational Research Network Coordinating Center (BETRNetCC)	"PROJECT SUMMARY
Although esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is a relatively uncommon cancer, the incidence of this disease
has increased rapidly in recent decades; moreover, at the time of detection of EA, most patients have very
poor prognosis. The alarming increase in EA over the past several decades, along with the poor prognosis for
those affected, demand investigation into the risk factors for this disease, improved management of patients at
risk, and development of preventive measures. Advances in these areas will have significant public health
benefit in terms of reducing morbidity and mortality for those affected, as well as reducing the public health
costs associated with managing EA at advanced stages.
To better manage patients at risk for EA will require an improved understanding of the mechanisms of
neoplastic progression in the esophagus. Such progression involves the development of Barrett's esophagus,
a premalignant lesion in which the normal stratified squamous epithelium of the distal esophagus is replaced
by columnar epithelium, visible as an abnormality on endoscopy, and confirmed on biopsy as specialized
columnar epithelium with intestinal metaplasia.
For these reasons, the NCI has developed the Barrett's Esophagus Translational Research Network
(BETRNet), a consortium research initiative with the goal of reducing the incidence, morbidity, and mortality of
EAC, through answering key questions related to the progression of this disease, especially in the
premalignant stage of BE, the only precursor lesion definitively associated with EA.
In this application we describe the accomplishments to date, as well as the vision forward, for the BETRNet
Coordinating Center (BETRNet-CC), with the following critical functions:
• Administrative and logistical support for the BETRNet program, including efficient communications and
 coordination of efforts to connect available resources, serve as a data management center, and integrate
 activities of the research centers;

5U54CA163004-10	U54CA163004	10183175	2021	The Role of the Microenvironment in Barrett's Esophagus	"OVERALL PROJECT SUMMARY
Barrett’s esophagus is an increasingly prevalent, preneoplastic disorder resulting from acid/bile reflux and
chronic inflammation at the GE junction. This application is a renewal of a long-standing multicenter,
translational research program from Columbia University, the University of Pennsylvania and the Mayo Clinic.
The team, which has been highly productive, will now focus on the role of microbiota and the tumor
microenvironment in the development and progression of Barrett’s esophagus and esophageal
adenocarcinoma. The group has added additional collaborative sites at MIT, the Dana Farber Cancer Institute
and Munich Technical University, and will utilize heavily a new Microbiome and Metabolomics Core at Penn-
CHOP. Thus, the team comprises broad and unique expertise in mouse models, genomics, microbiology and
clinical research. The application is built around the hypothesis that the inflammation-dependent tumor
microenvironment, modulated by the GE junction microbiome, is critical for early progression of esophageal
carcinogenesis. The proposal will utilize both the novel transgenic (L2-IL-1β) and innovative 3D organoid
models, along with a cross-sectional study of 100 BE patients. Project 1 will study the role of microbiota and
myeloid cells in the L2-IL-1β mouse model of Barrett’s esophagus. This project will incorporate germ-free
housing, antibiotic eradication, colonization with defined flora, myeloid cell ablation and correlative human
studies. Project 2 is focused on the characterization of microenvironment drivers in BE, and will include
FACS/IHC analysis of CAFs and immune cells (MDSCs/Tregs) in BE patients, along with 3D organoids in
culture. The role of IL-6 in response to epithelial TP53 mutations and immune cell activation will be defined.
Finally, Project 3 will seek to identify novel biomarkers and gene signatures related to the microbiome and
microenvironment. The study will analyze bile acids, a product of microbes, and minimally invasive tests such
as saliva/breath test/tethered capsule sponge to analyze microbes to develop screening/surveillance
strategies. Overall, these projects will advance the science of the microbiome and microenvironment in BE that
will hopefully lead to translational applications."	3-Dimensional;Ablation;Antibiotics;Barrett Esophagus;Bile Acids;Bile Reflux;Breath Tests;Cells;Chronic;Clinic;Clinical Research;Cross-Sectional Studies;Dana-Farber Cancer Institute;Development;Disease;Epithelial;Esophageal Adenocarcinoma;Genomics;Germ-Free;Goals;Housing;Human;Immune;Inflammation;Interleukin-1 beta;Interleukin-6;Intervention;Knowledge;Lead;Microbe;Microbiology;Modeling;Mutation;Myeloid Cells;Organoids;Patients;Pennsylvania;Porifera;Regulatory T-Lymphocyte;Role;Saliva;Site;TP53 gene;Testing;Transgenic Organisms;Universities;biomarker signature;capsule;esophageal carcinogenesis;genetic signature;immune activation;innovation;metabolomics;microbiome;microbiome research;microbiota;minimally invasive;mouse model;novel;novel marker;predictive marker;response;screening;surveillance strategy;translational research program;tumor microenvironment;tumorigenic	COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES	NEW YORK	NY	UNITED STATES	Julian Abrams, Anil K Rustgi	Rihab R.

5U54CA163059-10	U54CA163059	10155436	2021	Early Targets in Progression of Barrett's Esophagus to Esophageal Adenocarcinoma	"- Project Summary/Abstract
 Recently, the incidence of esophageal (EAC) and gastro-esophageal junction (GEJAC) adenocarcinoma
has increased dramatically, and have a poor 5-year survival rate of less than 15%. When detected early, these
patients can have a good clinical outcome following surgery. These observations underscore the importance
of early cancer detection. Patients with Barrett's esophagus (BE) are known to be at increased risk.
 Our overarching goal is to advance new methods of imaging to visualize the effects of spatial distribution
of genetic alterations in BE by using novel imaging methods to evaluate tumor heterogeneity on the
progression toward EAC. We propose a multi-institutional, trans-disciplinary, translational Research Center in
the Barrett's Esophagus Translational Research Network (BETRNet). Our mission is to build on our expertise
in genomic characterization, peptide biochemistry, and clinical translation to achieve our ultimate goal to
perform early cancer detection at an early stage where therapeutic intervention can be most effective. We will
identify a complementary panel of genes that are overexpressed on the cell surface and will be used to
develop and validate new peptide imaging agents. The targets chosen will address 3 important clinical needs:
1) Real-time endoscopic identification of pre-malignant lesions and early stage cancer to guide endoscopic
resection; 2) Risk stratification of BE patients for timing of endoscopic surveillance; and 3) Detection of gastro-
esophageal junction adenocarcinomas in patients without endoscopic appearance of BE.
 We will use state-of-the-art genomic tools to to identify early overexpressed gene targets that arise in
progression of BE to EAC by providing comprehensive analyses of gene expression alterations, DNA copy
number variation, and genetic mutations. We will select candidate genes that are expressed on the cell
surface where they can be endoscopically imaged in vivo. We will rigorously validate the panel of candidate
targets with quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays using an independent
cohort of human esophagus specimens. We will use these targets to first identify and validate monomer
peptides that are highly specific. We will then arrange monomer peptides in a dimer configuration to produce
multivalent ligand target interactions to improve binding performance and allow for early targets to be detected
at low levels of expression. We will use a flexible fiber multi-spectral endoscope that can pass through the
working channel of a standard medical endoscope to detect multiple targets at the same time.
 Successful completion of these aims will provide an integrated multi-spectral imaging methodology to
longitudinally visualize overexpressed molecular targets that drive progression of Barrett's esophagus to
esophageal adenocarcinoma. This innovative approach can serve as the foundation for validated preventive
measures to improve patient management."

5U54CA163059-09	U54CA163059	9948581	2020	Early Targets in Progression of Barrett's Esophagus to Esophageal Adenocarcinoma	"- Project Summary/Abstract
 Recently, the incidence of esophageal (EAC) and gastro-esophageal junction (GEJAC) adenocarcinoma
has increased dramatically, and have a poor 5-year survival rate of less than 15%. When detected early, these
patients can have a good clinical outcome following surgery. These observations underscore the importance
of early cancer detection. Patients with Barrett's esophagus (BE) are known to be at increased risk.
 Our overarching goal is to advance new methods of imaging to visualize the effects of spatial distribution
of genetic alterations in BE by using novel imaging methods to evaluate tumor heterogeneity on the
progression toward EAC. We propose a multi-institutional, trans-disciplinary, translational Research Center in
the Barrett's Esophagus Translational Research Network (BETRNet). Our mission is to build on our expertise
in genomic characterization, peptide biochemistry, and clinical translation to achieve our ultimate goal to
perform early cancer detection at an early stage where therapeutic intervention can be most effective. We will
identify a complementary panel of genes that are overexpressed on the cell surface and will be used to
develop and validate new peptide imaging agents. The targets chosen will address 3 important clinical needs:
1) Real-time endoscopic identification of pre-malignant lesions and early stage cancer to guide endoscopic
resection; 2) Risk stratification of BE patients for timing of endoscopic surveillance; and 3) Detection of gastro-
esophageal junction adenocarcinomas in patients without endoscopic appearance of BE.
 We will use state-of-the-art genomic tools to to identify early overexpressed gene targets that arise in
progression of BE to EAC by providing comprehensive analyses of gene expression alterations, DNA copy
number variation, and genetic mutations. We will select candidate genes that are expressed on the cell
surface where they can be endoscopically imaged in vivo. We will rigorously validate the panel of candidate
targets with quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays using an independent
cohort of human esophagus specimens. We will use these targets to first identify and validate monomer
peptides that are highly specific. We will then arrange monomer peptides in a dimer configuration to produce
multivalent ligand target interactions to improve binding performance and allow for early targets to be detected
at low levels of expression. We will use a flexible fiber multi-spectral endoscope that can pass through the
working channel of a standard medical endoscope to detect multiple targets at the same time.
 Successful completion of these aims will provide an integrated multi-spectral imaging methodology to
longitudinally visualize overexpressed molecular targets that drive progression of Barrett's esophagus to
esophageal adenocarcinoma. This innovative approach can serve as the foundation for validated preventive
measures to improve patient management."

3U54CA163004-07S1	U54CA163004	9720207	2018	The Role of the Microenvironment in Barrett's Esophagus	"OVERALL PROJECT SUMMARY
Barrett’s esophagus is an increasingly prevalent, preneoplastic disorder resulting from acid/bile reflux and
chronic inflammation at the GE junction. This application is a renewal of a long-standing multicenter,
translational research program from Columbia University, the University of Pennsylvania and the Mayo Clinic.
The team, which has been highly productive, will now focus on the role of microbiota and the tumor
microenvironment in the development and progression of Barrett’s esophagus and esophageal
adenocarcinoma. The group has added additional collaborative sites at MIT, the Dana Farber Cancer Institute
and Munich Technical University, and will utilize heavily a new Microbiome and Metabolomics Core at Penn-
CHOP. Thus, the team comprises broad and unique expertise in mouse models, genomics, microbiology and
clinical research. The application is built around the hypothesis that the inflammation-dependent tumor
microenvironment, modulated by the GE junction microbiome, is critical for early progression of esophageal
carcinogenesis. The proposal will utilize both the novel transgenic (L2-IL-1β) and innovative 3D organoid
models, along with a cross-sectional study of 100 BE patients. Project 1 will study the role of microbiota and
myeloid cells in the L2-IL-1β mouse model of Barrett’s esophagus. This project will incorporate germ-free
housing, antibiotic eradication, colonization with defined flora, myeloid cell ablation and correlative human
studies. Project 2 is focused on the characterization of microenvironment drivers in BE, and will include
FACS/IHC analysis of CAFs and immune cells (MDSCs/Tregs) in BE patients, along with 3D organoids in
culture. The role of IL-6 in response to epithelial TP53 mutations and immune cell activation will be defined.
Finally, Project 3 will seek to identify novel biomarkers and gene signatures related to the microbiome and
microenvironment. The study will analyze bile acids, a product of microbes, and minimally invasive tests such
as saliva/breath test/tethered capsule sponge to analyze microbes to develop screening/surveillance

Barrett’s esophagus is an increasingly prevalent, preneoplastic disorder resulting from acid/bile reflux and
chronic inflammation at the GE junction. This application is a renewal of a long-standing multicenter,
translational research program from Columbia University, the University of Pennsylvania and the Mayo Clinic.
The team, which has been highly productive, will now focus on the role of microbiota and the tumor
microenvironment in the development and progression of Barrett’s esophagus and esophageal
adenocarcinoma. The group has added additional collaborative sites at MIT, the Dana Farber Cancer Institute
and Munich Technical University, and will utilize heavily a new Microbiome and Metabolomics Core at Penn-
CHOP. Thus, the team comprises broad and unique expertise in mouse models, genomics, microbiology and
clinical research. The application is built around the hypothesis that the inflammation-dependent tumor
microenvironment, modulated by the GE junction microbiome, is critical for early progression of esophageal
carcinogenesis. The proposal will utilize both the novel transgenic (L2-IL-1β) and innovative 3D organoid
models, along with a cross-sectional study of 100 BE patients. Project 1 will study the role of microbiota and
myeloid cells in the L2-IL-1β mouse model of Barrett’s esophagus. This project will incorporate germ-free
housing, antibiotic eradication, colonization with defined flora, myeloid cell ablation and correlative human
studies. Project 2 is focused on the characterization of microenvironment drivers in BE, and will include
FACS/IHC analysis of CAFs and immune cells (MDSCs/Tregs) in BE patients, along with 3D organoids in
culture. The role of IL-6 in response to epithelial TP53 mutations and immune cell activation will be defined.
Finally, Project 3 will seek to identify novel biomarkers and gene signatures related to the microbiome and
microenvironment. The study will analyze bile acids, a product of microbes, and minimally invasive tests such
as saliva/breath test/tethered capsule sponge to analyze microbes to develop screening/surveillance
strategies. Overall, these projects will advance the science of the microbiome and microenvironment in BE that
will hopefully lead to translational applications."

2U54CA163059-06	U54CA163059	9277831	2017	Early Targets in Progression of Barrett's Esophagus to Esophageal Adenocarcinoma	"- Project Summary/Abstract
 Recently, the incidence of esophageal (EAC) and gastro-esophageal junction (GEJAC) adenocarcinoma
has increased dramatically, and have a poor 5-year survival rate of less than 15%. When detected early, these
patients can have a good clinical outcome following surgery. These observations underscore the importance
of early cancer detection. Patients with Barrett's esophagus (BE) are known to be at increased risk.
 Our overarching goal is to advance new methods of imaging to visualize the effects of spatial distribution
of genetic alterations in BE by using novel imaging methods to evaluate tumor heterogeneity on the
progression toward EAC. We propose a multi-institutional, trans-disciplinary, translational Research Center in
the Barrett's Esophagus Translational Research Network (BETRNet). Our mission is to build on our expertise
in genomic characterization, peptide biochemistry, and clinical translation to achieve our ultimate goal to
perform early cancer detection at an early stage where therapeutic intervention can be most effective. We will
identify a complementary panel of genes that are overexpressed on the cell surface and will be used to
develop and validate new peptide imaging agents. The targets chosen will address 3 important clinical needs:
1) Real-time endoscopic identification of pre-malignant lesions and early stage cancer to guide endoscopic
resection; 2) Risk stratification of BE patients for timing of endoscopic surveillance; and 3) Detection of gastro-
esophageal junction adenocarcinomas in patients without endoscopic appearance of BE.
 We will use state-of-the-art genomic tools to to identify early overexpressed gene targets that arise in
progression of BE to EAC by providing comprehensive analyses of gene expression alterations, DNA copy
number variation, and genetic mutations. We will select candidate genes that are expressed on the cell
surface where they can be endoscopically imaged in vivo. We will rigorously validate the panel of candidate
targets with quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays using an independent
cohort of human esophagus specimens. We will use these targets to first identify and validate monomer
peptides that are highly specific. We will then arrange monomer peptides in a dimer configuration to produce
multivalent ligand target interactions to improve binding performance and allow for early targets to be detected
at low levels of expression. We will use a flexible fiber multi-spectral endoscope that can pass through the
working channel of a standard medical endoscope to detect multiple targets at the same time.
 Successful completion of these aims will provide an integrated multi-spectral imaging methodology to
longitudinally visualize overexpressed molecular targets that drive progression of Barrett's esophagus to
esophageal adenocarcinoma. This innovative approach can serve as the foundation for validated preventive
measures to improve patient management."

The applicant group, which includes established investigators from Columbia University, the University of Pennsylvania, and the Mayo Clinic, propose a multidisciplinary, multicenter, translational research program to study the origins and pathogenesis of the disorder. The team, many of whom have collaborated in the past, will focus on the role of chronic inflammation and bile acids in the upregulation of established and novel stem cell markers, and possible ways to target these progenitor cells. The proposal builds on extensive basic science findings, the development of novel transgenic (L2-IL-1beta) and surgical models of BE/esophageal adenocarcinoma, and preliminary analyses of human BE  
tissues. The groups will bring to the network a very large BE patient population, experienced Barrett's clinical investigators, and bench researchers with extensive experience with stem cells and inflammatory models of Gl cancer. Three projects are proposed. Project 1 will focus on the role of Notch signaling in models of Barrett's esophagus, and will determine the effects of Notch inhibition or Notch activation on progression to dysplasia. Project 2 will seek to characterize the cell of origin in Barrett's esophagus in our mouse models. We will use constituitive and inducible mouse models of Cre expression to lineage trace active and quiescent progenitors that are upregulated in our model and in human BE. Additionally, we will carry out a pilot clinical trial using an antagonist of a G-protein coupled receptor expressed on progenitor cells upregulated in BE. Finally, Project 3 will aim to identify novel biomarkers and gene signatures in BE, correlating data sets from animal and human models, clarifying the importance of non-goblet cell columnar epithelium and changes in the gastric cardia. We will also assemble a cohort of patients undergoing radiofrequency ablation, identifying biomarkers of response to therapy and using successfully ablated patients as a novel human model to study the development of BE. Overall, these studies aim to elucidate the earliest stages and cell types that contribute to BE pathogenesis in order to better stratify risk and develop preventive therapies."

In Project 1, genomic data will be analyzed to identify molecular targets based on properties of gene amplification and/or overexpression. These targets will be used to select highly specific peptides in Project 2 that will be fluorescent-labeled for detection on imaging. A multi-spectral scanning fiber endoscope will be developed in Project 3 to perform real time visualization of a panel of peptides in 3 fluorescence channels. The unique instrument design can pass through the working channel of a standard medical endoscope to allow for concurrent white light imaging. Future versions of this instrument may have 12 or more channels. Image processing algorithms will developed to ""red-flag"" diseased regions on a panoramic view of the distal esophagus. This integrated imaging strategy aims to assist the physician in guiding tissue biopsy of high grade dysplasia and early adenocarcinoma that can not been seen otherwise. Phase 1 studies will be performed to prepare for a future multi-center clinical validation study. Future applications will allow for real time spatial visualization and monitoring of other targets, including those associated with stem cells or with biomarkers of cancer risk. Moreover, imaging of molecular targets can be performed in patients with Barrett's esophagus over time to better understand the molecular mechanisms of this disease. The 3 Cores will support the Primary Research Projects, Pilot Projects, and Cross-BETRNet Projects. The Administrative Core will provide support for grants and regulatory management, including budgets, financial reporting, progress reports, human subjects protocols, investigation of new drug (IND) applications, and Steering Committee representation. The Bioinformatics Core will provide support the Primary Projects for statistical evaluation of genomic, imaging, and clinical data and the BETRNet Network for data sharing and archiving of tissue specimens. The Validation & Pathology Core will provide support for validation of peptide binding activity to amplified and overexpressed gene targets in high-grade dysplasia and early adenocarcinoma."

Three projects are proposed. Project 1 will focus on the role of Notch signaling in models of Barrett's esophagus, and will determine the effects of Notch inhibition or Notch activation on progression to dysplasia. Project 2 will seek to characterize the cell of origin in Barrett's esophagus in our mouse models. We will use constituitive and inducible mouse models of Cre expression to lineage trace active and quiescent progenitors that are upregulated in our model and in human BE. Additionally, we will carry out a pilot clinical trial using an antagonist of a G-protein coupled receptor expressed on progenitor cells upregulated in BE. Finally, Project 3 will aim to identify novel biomarkers and gene signatures in BE, correlating data sets from animal and human models, clarifying the importance of non-goblet cell columnar epithelium and changes in the gastric cardia. We will also assemble a cohort of patients undergoing radiofrequency ablation, identifying biomarkers of response to therapy and using successfully ablated patients as a novel human model to study the development of BE. Overall, these studies aim to elucidate the earliest stages and cell types that contribute to BE pathogenesis in order to better stratify risk and develop preventive therapies.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The broad, long-term objective of this project is to develop a multi-institutional, multi-disciplinary translational Research Center to accelerate the clinical use of targeted imaging methodologies for the early detection and prevention of esophageal adenocarcinoma through the Barrett's Esophagus Translational Research Network (BETRNet). 3 inter-related Primary Research Projects and Shared Research Resources (Cores) will be established to develop advanced endoscopic imaging as an enabling technology for management of patients with Barrett's esophagus by visualizing molecular targets from amplified and overexpressed genes. In Project 1, genomic data will be analyzed to identify molecular targets based on properties of gene amplification and/or overexpression. These targets will be used to select highly specific peptides in Project 2 that will be fluorescent-labeled for detection on imaging. A multi-spectral scanning fiber endoscope will be developed in Project 3 to perform real time visualization of a panel of peptides in 3 fluorescence channels. The unique instrument design can pass through the working channel of a standard medical endoscope to allow for concurrent white light imaging. Future versions of this instrument may have 12 or more channels. Image processing algorithms will developed to ""red-flag"" diseased regions on a panoramic view of the distal esophagus. This integrated imaging strategy aims to assist the physician in guiding tissue biopsy of high grade dysplasia and early adenocarcinoma that can not been seen otherwise.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall objectives of this BETRNet Translational Research Center (TRC-F) are: 1) to conduct a rigorous, integrated spectrum of transdisciplinary human research in Barrett's esophagus (BE) and esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) 2) to increase the biological understanding of key observations made by our clinical researchers (familial aggregation of BE and EAC, restitution of squamous mucosa after ablation); 3) to translate knowledge derived from genetic and physiologic research to solving clinical dilemmas in detection, prognosis, and therapy of BE in order to prevent EAC and improve the outcomes of EAC;4) to foster a transdisciplinary and translational research culture and to effectively expand and enhance scientific research focused on BE and EAC; 5) to evaluate research and transdisciplinary programs and to continuously Improve research, productivity and enhance translational implementation. These objectives build and synergize on existing multi-institutional collaborative networks and the considerable clinical, basic science, and translational expertise available at our institutions, focusing on improving the outcomes of patients with BE and EAC. The overarching organization framework for this TRCF proposal is 1) to focus research on understanding the genetic susceptibility, genomic and epigenetic changes that influence the development of BE and EAC; 2) to explore the physiologic, transcriptional, and epigenetic factors that lead to durable ablation of BE; and 3) to translate discoveries into applications that improve familial screening, effective detection, molecular prognostication, and durable ablation of BE.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The broad, long-term objective of this project is to develop a multi-institutional, multi-disciplinary translational Research Center to accelerate the clinical use of targeted imaging methodologies for the early detection and prevention of esophageal adenocarcinoma through the Barrett's Esophagus Translational Research Network (BETRNet). 3 inter-related Primary Research Projects and Shared Research Resources (Cores) will be established to develop advanced endoscopic imaging as an enabling technology for management of patients with Barrett's esophagus by visualizing molecular targets from amplified and overexpressed genes. In Project 1, genomic data will be analyzed to identify molecular targets based on properties of gene amplification and/or overexpression. These targets will be used to select highly specific peptides in Project 2 that will be fluorescent-labeled for detection on imaging. A multi-spectral scanning fiber endoscope will be developed in Project 3 to perform real time visualization of a panel of peptides in 3 fluorescence channels. The unique instrument design can pass through the working channel of a standard medical endoscope to allow for concurrent white light imaging. Future versions of this instrument may have 12 or more channels. Image processing algorithms will developed to ""red-flag"" diseased regions on a panoramic view of the distal esophagus. This integrated imaging strategy aims to assist the physician in guiding tissue biopsy of high grade dysplasia and early adenocarcinoma that can not been seen otherwise. Phase 1 studies will be performed to prepare for a future multi-center clinical validation study. Future applications will allow for real time spatial visualization and monitoring of other targets, including those associated with stem cells or with biomarkers of cancer risk. Moreover, imaging of molecular targets can be performed in patients with Barrett's esophagus over time to better understand the molecular mechanisms of this disease. The 3 Cores will support the Primary Research Projects, Pilot Projects, and Cross-BETRNet Projects. The Administrative Core will provide support for grants and regulatory management, including budgets, financial reporting, progress reports, human subjects protocols, investigation of new drug (IND) applications, and Steering Committee representation. The Bioinformatics Core will provide support the Primary Projects for statistical evaluation of genomic, imaging, and clinical data and the BETRNet Network for data sharing and archiving of tissue specimens. The Validation & Pathology Core will provide support for validation of peptide binding activity to amplified and overexpressed gene targets in high-grade dysplasia and early adenocarcinoma.

5U54CA163004-02	U54CA163004	8339428	2012	Stem Cells And The Origins of Barrett's Esophagus	"  
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Barrett's esophagus is an increasingly prevalent, preneoplastic disorder that results primarily from gastroduodenal reflux of acid and bile. The applicant group, which includes established investigators from Columbia University, the University of Pennsylvania, and the Mayo Clinic, propose a multidisciplinary, multicenter, translational research program to study the origins and pathogenesis of the disorder. The team, many of whom have collaborated in the past, will focus on the role of chronic inflammation and bile acids in the upregulation of established and novel stem cell markers, and possible ways to target these progenitor cells. The proposal builds on extensive basic science findings, the development of novel transgenic (L2-IL-1beta) and surgical models of BE/esophageal adenocarcinoma, and preliminary analyses of human BE  
tissues. The groups will bring to the network a very large BE patient population, experienced Barrett's clinical investigators, and bench researchers with extensive experience with stem cells and inflammatory models of Gl cancer. Three projects are proposed. Project 1 will focus on the role of Notch signaling in models of Barrett's esophagus, and will determine the effects of Notch inhibition or Notch activation on progression to dysplasia. Project 2 will seek to characterize the cell of origin in Barrett's esophagus in our mouse models. We will use constituitive and inducible mouse models of Cre expression to lineage trace active and quiescent progenitors that are upregulated in our model and in human BE. Additionally, we will carry out a pilot clinical trial using an antagonist of a G-protein coupled receptor expressed on progenitor cells upregulated in BE. Finally, Project 3 will aim to identify novel biomarkers and gene signatures in BE, correlating data sets from animal and human models, clarifying the importance of non-goblet cell columnar epithelium and changes in the gastric cardia. We will also assemble a cohort of patients undergoing radiofrequency ablation, identifying biomarkers of response to therapy and using successfully ablated patients as a novel human model to study the development of BE. Overall, these studies aim to elucidate the earliest stages and cell types that contribute to BE pathogenesis in order to better stratify risk and develop preventive therapies.
