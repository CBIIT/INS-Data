3R01CA239701-01A1S3	R01CA239701	10626271	2022	Admixture analysis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in African American children: the ADMIRAL Study	"Abstract
This application is being submitted in response to the Notice of Special Interest (NOSI) identified as “NOT-CA-
22-057”. In our parent project titled “Admixture analysis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in African
American children (ADMIRAL Study; R01CA239701), we are performing admixture mapping to identify ancestral
genomic loci that may account for differential risk and unfavorable clinical phenotypes of ALL in African American
(AA) children. In this Administrative Supplement Opportunity to Stimulate or Strengthen Global Cancer Health
Disparities Research, we propose synergistic molecular epidemiology research to identify leukemia biology
factors that potentially underly the same clinical problem (unfavorable ALL phenotypes) among children in Africa.
The high burden of childhood ALL and urgent importance to effectively control the cancer in Africa is highlighted
by the World Health Organization’s Global Initiative for Childhood Cancer. The goal of the proposed
supplemental research project is to leverage this African childhood ALL cohort as a triangulating comparator that
shares genetic ancestry with AA but lacks European admixture and has a distinctively different landscape of
environmental immune challenges, namely, endemic viral infections. The purpose is to identify the biological
underpinnings of unfavorable ALL prognostic factors in AA and African children that can be targeted to reduce
ALL survival disparities in these populations. Our overarching approach is to characterize somatic, inherited, and
environmental determinants of clinical differences in childhood ALL among world populations; the Specific Aims
are to: 1. Identify the cytogenetic abnormalities that may underpin unfavorable ALL clinical phenotypes among
children of African ancestry and their association with African/European genetic admixture. 2. Compare the
prevalence of replicated inherited single nucleotide variants (SNVs) that are reported in the literature to be
associated with ALL risk and outcomes among African, AA and EA children. 3. Characterize the plasma
exogenous virome in children with ALL in Africa."

3R01CA239701-01A1S2	R01CA239701	10555358	2022	Sex and racial/ethnic differences in B-ALL genomics	"Project Summary
Children with substantial African ancestry have long been known to have half or less the rate of B-
cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) than do children with other continental ancestries. Moreover,
AA children have lower incidence despite having greater exposure to many putatively causal environmental
risk factors for B-ALL than do white children. However, even within AA children, we still observe a 30% excess
incidence of ALL among males compared to females at all ages and a remarkable 300% increased incidence
at 12 years of age. The male excess may depend on sex-varying associations with the disease for germline
genetics on the autosomes and the X chromosome, sex differences in immune function, and/or hormonal
differences. Common genetic variants established by genomewide association studies (GWAS)
incompletely explain the deficit of B-ALL in AA children, suggesting undiscovered contributing genetic
factors may be detected by admixture mapping. Few studies examine GWAS by sex. The parent R01 of this
Administrative Supplement, titled “Admixture analysis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in African American
children: the ADMIRAL Study” (R01 CA239701), includes existing DNA samples and data for 930 B-ALL
patients with AA ancestry and will accrue ~600 samples over the remaining project years. We are conducting
admixture mapping in the assembled group of patients to detect new genetic loci and new variants at
established loci associated with occurrence of B-ALL. In addition, we are examining admixture in association
with clinical characteristics at diagnosis and survival. Candidate genes/variants will be functionally evaluated
through both in silico and in vitro techniques. For the Administrative Supplement, we will conduct sex-stratified
GWAS in AA children with B-ALL from the parent R01 and we will expand our analyses to include the X
chromosome, which is generally excluded from GWAS. As part of this Award, we will generate a new source of
genomic data from healthy AA children using umbilical cord hematopoietic stem cells, which we will use to map
sex-differential expression quantitative trait loci for each sex thereby decreasing our search space for disease-
relevant loci and increase our power to identify biologically relevant loci in AA males and females with B-ALL.
Findings will be placed in context to those observed in AA children that we are currently generating as part of
our other funded research. The proposed research will potentially answer a long-standing mystery by revealing
critical genes or loci that may explain increased incidence of B-ALL in AA males. Identifying sex-varying
associations between germline SNVs and childhood ALL will allow us to identify biologic mechanisms
contributing to the observed sex differences in AA B-ALL incidence."	12 year old;Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia;Administrative Supplement;Admixture;Adult;African;African American;African ancestry;Age;Award;B-Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia;B-Lymphocytes;Behavior;Biological;Birth Weight;CD34 gene;Candidate Disease Gene;Case-Control Studies;Cessation of life;Characteristics;Child;Childhood;Childhood Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia;Childhood Leukemia;Childhood Precursor B Lymphoblastic Leukemia;Clinical;Clinical Data;Complex;Confidence Intervals;DNA;Data;Diagnosis;Disease;Environment;Environmental Risk Factor;Etiology;European;Exhibits;Exposure to;Female;Funding;Future;Genes;Genetic;Genetic Models;Genome;Genomics;Goals;Hematopoietic;Hematopoietic stem cells;Heritability;Hormonal;Human;In Vitro;Incidence;Inherited;Investigation;Knowledge;Malignant Childhood Neoplasm;Malignant Neoplasms;Maps;Maternal Age;Modeling;Molecular;Newborn Infant;Odds Ratio;Parents;Patients;Perinatal;Prevalence;Prevention strategy;Process;Puberty;Quantitative Trait Loci;Relapse;Research;Risk;Risk Factors;Role;Sampling;Sex Chromosomes;Sex Differences;Single Nucleotide Polymorphism;Source;Techniques;Time;Tissues;Umbilical cord structure;Variant;X Chromosome;admixture mapping;autosome;base;caucasian American;differential expression;disorder risk;ethnic difference;experience;gene environment interaction;genetic variant;genome wide association study;genome-wide;genomic data;genomic locus;genotypic sex;immune function;in silico;male;minority children;parent grant;public health relevance;racial and ethnic;racial difference;risk variant;sex;stem cells;trait;young adult	UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA	MINNEAPOLIS	MN	UNITED STATES	Michael E Scheurer, Logan G.

Children with substantial African ancestry have long been known to have half or less the rate of B-cell acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) than do children with other continental ancestries. This is true both in
international comparisons of rates of ALL in African nations to those elsewhere, and in comparing rate of B-ALL
in African-American (AA) children to that in European-American (EA) children in the United States. The inverse
association of African ancestry with incidence of B-ALL is independent of established perinatal risk factors for
the disease. Moreover, AA children have lower incidence despite having greater exposure to many putatively
causal environmental risk factors for B-ALL than do EA children. Common genetic variants established by
genomewide association studies incompletely explain the deficit of B-ALL in AA children, suggesting
undiscovered contributing genetic factors may be detected by admixture mapping. We have assembled existing
DNA samples and data for 930 B-ALL patients with AA ancestry and will additionally accrue ~590 over the life
of the project. We will conduct admixture mapping in the assembled group of patients to detect new genetic loci
and new variants at established loci associated with occurrence of B-ALL. In addition, we will examine admixture
in association with clinical characteristics at diagnosis and survival. Candidate genes/variants will be functionally
evaluated through both in silico and in vitro techniques. The proposed research will potentially answer a long-
standing mystery by revealing critical genes or loci that explain the comparative deficit of B-ALL in AA compared
to EA children. In addition, we may uncover genes or variants associated with the worse characteristics at
presentation in AA patients as well as with worse survival, which will indicate avenues for improving outcome
among AA children."
