5P50CA228944-06	P50CA228944	10700901	2023	Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center Lung SPORE	"Project Summary/Abstract – Overall
The Fred Hutch Lung SPORE consists of four innovative projects, three supportive cores, and the required
Developmental Research Program and Career Enhancement Program. We have leveraged the strengths of
the investigators and our Center to tackle three critical barriers precluding meaningful improvements in lung
cancer survival rates: facilitation of pulmonary nodule evaluation for lung cancer early detection and
screening, lack of effective therapies for small cell lung cancer (SCLC), and the sub-optimal response rates of
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients to novel immune-based therapies. To overcome these barriers,
we propose the following four projects: 1) Targeting the Neutrophil Lineage to Enhance Immune Checkpoint
Inhibitor Efficacy in NSCLC, 2) Targeting Neoantigens for Lung Cancer Immunotherapy, 3) Identifying
Determinants of Sensitivity to LSD1 Inhibition in SCLC, and 4) Risk Stratification for Pulmonary Nodules
Detected by CT Imaging Using Plasma and Imaging Biomarkers. These projects will be supported by an
Administrative Core, a Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Core (BBC), and a Histopathology and Biospecimen
Core (HBC)."
