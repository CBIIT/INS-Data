5P50CA097257-20	P50CA097257	10472553	2022	Brain Tumor SPORE Grant	"Project Summary/Abstract
 This SPORE renewal application represents the efforts of interdisciplinary teams of investigators
from the Neuro-Oncology Program of the UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center
(HDFCCC) to apply their knowledge and expertise to translational research focused on brain cancer.
This SPORE proposal has three overall specific objectives: 1) to identify factors that contribute to the
likelihood of surviving brain cancer; 2) to identify noninvasive imaging parameters that can help predict
therapeutic response in patients with glioma; and 3) to develop better mechanism-based therapies for
the treatment of brain cancer. The heart of the proposal is four new translational research projects,
each driven by teams of applied and basic investigators, and each intended to create novel tools and
therapeutic modalities useful in the diagnosis and treatment of brain tumors. Project 1 is a new study
motivated by previous SPORE-funded successes in identifying molecular features (TERT promoter
mutation, 1p/19q deletion, and IDH1 mutation) that divide lower grade glioma into 4 distinct groups, and
along with work from others, led to modifications in WHO criteria for glioma classification. Project 1
investigators now hypothesize that an analysis of levels of various circulating myeloid cells, rather than
of tumor molecular features, may yield advances in differentiating prognosis for IDH-wildtype
glioblastoma after accounting for certain clinical characteristics. They will test this hypothesis using an
approach they pioneered that defines and quantitates aberrant immune cell populations from fresh or
frozen peripheral blood based on patterns of DNA methylation in the immune cell genomes, a new field
of study called immunomethylomics. Project 2 is a new study facilitated in part by previous SPORE-
funded studies that used MRSI to noninvasively define changes in steady state levels of metabolites
that related to low-grade glioma progression. In Project 2 the investigators hypothesize that the use of
hyperpolarized carbon-13 (C13) imaging, developed at UCSF, can provide complementary information
about metabolic processes, which in turn can be used to noninvasively differentiate between normal
brain, tumor and gliosis in the human glioblastoma setting. Project 3 is a new study that evolved from
groundbreaking work from the Costello lab that identified GABP as the transcription factor that uniquely
binds the mutant TERT promoter and drives TERT expression, cellular immortalization and
tumorigenesis in many types of cancer including glioma. The work proposed in Project 3 will lay the
groundwork for the development of mutant TERT promoter-based therapeutics by assessing the
uniformity of TERT promoter mutations in human glioma samples, by directly defining the importance of
GABP in TERT activation, and by devising ways to increase cell death following TERT silencing.
Project 4 is a new project based on the observation that inhibition of the downstream mTOR target
4EBP is critical for effective growth suppression of PI3K-driven glioblastoma, and that clinical failure of
PI3K pathway-targeted therapeutics in glioblastoma is the result insufficient sustained 4EBP
suppression. Accordingly Project 4 investigators synthesized an entirely new class of molecules that
provide sustained 4EBP suppression and growth inhibition in vivo, and in this project will define the
optimal glioma target population for the drug, will optimize the efficacy of the lead agent, and propose
the first clinical trial of this new class of agents in glioma patients. This SPORE proposal also requests
continued support for the extremely important Career Enhancement and Developmental Research
Programs, and for three Cores (Administrative, Biospecimen/Pathology, and Biostatistics and Clinical)
that will support the efforts of the four projects. By addressing the overall specific objectives described,
the research proposed in this Brain Tumor SPORE application has a high likelihood of changing the
way we detect, diagnose, and treat brain cancer."	19q;Accounting;Address;Binding;Biometry;Brain Neoplasms;Carbon;Cell Death;Cells;Characteristics;Classification;Clinical;Clinical Trials;Comprehensive Cancer Center;DNA Methylation;Development;Diagnosis;Disease;FRAP1 gene;Failure;Family;Freezing;Funding;Genome;Glioblastoma;Glioma;Gliosis;Grant;Growth;Heart;Human;Image;Immune;Incidence;Individual;Knowledge;Lead;Learning;Malignant neoplasm of brain;Metabolism;Modality;Modification;Molecular;Mutation;Myeloid Cells;Neurosurgeon;Oncologist;Pathology;Pathway interactions;Patients;Pattern;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Population;Prediction of Response to Therapy;Process;Prognosis;Research;Research Personnel;Research Project Grants;Sampling;Target Populations;Testing;Therapeutic;Translational Research;Work;base;cancer type;career;field study;improved;in vivo;magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging;mortality;mutant;neuro-oncology;non-invasive imaging;novel;oncology program;peripheral blood;programs;promoter;success;targeted treatment;tool;transcription factor;tumor;tumorigenesis	UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO	SAN FRANCISCO	CA	UNITED STATES	Mitchel S.

The proposal has four overall specific objectives: 1) to identify factors that contribute to the likelihood of surviving brain cancer; 2) o identify imaging parameters and linked tissue biomarkers that predict recurrence and outcome in patients with low grade glioma; 3) to develop improved therapies for pediatric brain tumors harboring BRAF mutations; and 4) to improve immunotherapy for brain cancer. At the heart of the proposal are four translational research projects. Project 1 will identify genetic variations associated with survival in low-grade glioma and GBM patients, and will integrate survival genes identified in genome-wide association studies with IDH mutation and other molecular characteristics in the best example of integrative genomics pertaining to glioma survival to date. Project 2 will assess the ability of the spectroscopic markers identified in the previous funding period to predict time to progression and overall survival in low-grade glioma patients. The project also includes a first-ever analysis of the mutations that drive low-grade glioma formation and progression and which may help link genetic alterations to the spectroscopic changes noted. Project 3 is new to this proposal and will build on seminal studies that identified BRAF mutations in pediatric brain tumors. The project will preclinically evaluate new combinations of mechanism-based BRAF, MEK, and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors as well as initiate the first clinical trials of BRAF inhibitors in the pediatric brain tumor population. Project 4 will determine the impact of the PI(3)K//B7-H1 pathway on expansion of immunomodulatory T-cells and macrophages, and will investigate the utility of inhibiting PI(3)K/B7-H1 to augment immunotherapy in a clinical trial for GBM patients.

5P50CA097257-13	P50CA097257	8920005	2015	SPORE: Brain Tumore SPORE Grant	DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This revised SPORE renewal application represents the efforts of interdisciplinary teams of investigators from the Neuro-Oncology Program of the UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center to apply their expertise to translational research focused on brain cancer. The proposal has four overall specific objectives: 1) to identify factors that contribute to the likelihood of surviving brain cancer; 2) o identify imaging parameters and linked tissue biomarkers that predict recurrence and outcome in patients with low grade glioma; 3) to develop improved therapies for pediatric brain tumors harboring BRAF mutations; and 4) to improve immunotherapy for brain cancer. At the heart of the proposal are four translational research projects. Project 1 will identify genetic variations associated with survival in low-grade glioma and GBM patients, and will integrate survival genes identified in genome-wide association studies with IDH mutation and other molecular characteristics in the best example of integrative genomics pertaining to glioma survival to date. Project 2 will assess the ability of the spectroscopic markers identified in the previous funding period to predict time to progression and overall survival in low-grade glioma patients. The project also includes a first-ever analysis of the mutations that drive low-grade glioma formation and progression and which may help link genetic alterations to the spectroscopic changes noted. Project 3 is new to this proposal and will build on seminal studies that identified BRAF mutations in pediatric brain tumors. The project will preclinically evaluate new combinations of mechanism-based BRAF, MEK, and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors as well as initiate the first clinical trials of BRAF inhibitors in the pediatric brain tumor population. Project 4 will determine the impact of the PI(3)K//B7-H1 pathway on expansion of immunomodulatory T-cells and macrophages, and will investigate the utility of inhibiting PI(3)K/B7-H1 to augment immunotherapy in a clinical trial for GBM patients.

The heart of the application is five translational research projects, each driven by teams of applied and basic investigators, and each intended to create novel tools and therapies useful in the treatment of brain tumors. Project One is an extension of a highly successful population science project that intends to define factors important in glioma patient survival. Project Two is an extension of a highly successful imaging project that intends to use sophisticated spectroscopic techniques to non-invasively define factors that predict low-grade glioma biology. Project Three builds on novel drug-containing lipidic nanoparticles developed in the previous funding period, and proposes to generate and test new therapeutic nanoparticles whose distribution can be controlled by convection-enhanced delivery and monitored in real time spectroscopically. Project Four proposes lab based and clinical studies intended to clarify and exploit the negative association discovered in the previous funding period between Akt activation and sensitivity to the EGFR inhibitor erlotinib. Project Five, which evolved from the convergence of two Developmental Research Projects in the previous funding period, proposes lab-based and clinical studies intended to investigate and exploit the role the PTEN/Akt/mTOR pathway plays in response to glioma vaccine therapy. The application also requests continued support for highly successful Career Development and Developmental Research Programs, and for four Cores (the existing Tissue and Administrative Cores and the new Animal and Biostatistics/Clinical Core) that will support all aspects of the work.

2P50CA097257-06	P50CA097257	7245162	2007	BRAIN TUMOR SPORE GRANT	"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This SPORE renewal application represents the efforts of interdisciplinary teams of investigators from the Neuro-Oncology Program of the UCSF Comprehensive Cancer Center to apply their knowledge and expertise to translational research focused on brain tumors. The heart of the application is five translational research projects, each driven by teams of applied and basic investigators, and each intended to create novel tools and therapies useful in the treatment of brain tumors. Project One is an extension of a highly successful population science project that intends to define factors important in glioma patient survival. Project Two is an extension of a highly successful imaging project that intends to use sophisticated spectroscopic techniques to non-invasively define factors that predict low-grade glioma biology. Project Three builds on novel drug-containing lipidic nanoparticles developed in the previous funding period, and proposes to generate and test new therapeutic nanoparticles whose distribution can be controlled by convection-enhanced delivery and monitored in real time spectroscopically. Project Four proposes lab based and clinical studies intended to clarify and exploit the negative association discovered in the previous funding period between Akt activation and sensitivity to the EGFR inhibitor erlotinib. Project Five, which evolved from the convergence of two Developmental Research Projects in the previous funding period, proposes lab-based and clinical studies intended to investigate and exploit the role the PTEN/Akt/mTOR pathway plays in response to glioma vaccine therapy. The application also requests continued support for highly successful Career Development and Developmental Research Programs, and for four Cores (the existing Tissue and Administrative Cores and the new Animal and Biostatistics/Clinical Core) that will support all aspects of the work. Each project draws on the extensive experience of the investigators in brain tumor research, and on the long history of translational brain tumor research in the UCSF Department of Neurological Surgery and UCSF Brain Tumor Research Center. The projects will be additionally strengthened by collaborations with scientists in the UCSF Comprehensive Cancer Center and in the UCSF Breast and Prostate SPOREs. Finally, as a leading center of brain tumor clinical trials in America, an infrastructure is in place in the UCSF Neuro-Oncology Program to allow rapid clinical translation of important scientific discoveries.
