1U54CA272688-01	U54CA272688	10505675	2022	CAP-IT Center for LNP RNA Immunoprevention	"Overall Component: Project Summary/Abstract
The overall goal of CAP-IT Center for RNA Immunoprevention (CRI) is to pre-clinically delineate, formulate and
validate liponanoparticle RNA (LNP RNA) vaccines for precision prevention of individuals with increased cancer
risk. The PI is Dr. Lipkin, an established leader in Cancer Prevention who has made several important, clinically
translated contributions to the field. Project 1 will develop and validate an LNP RNA immunoprevention vaccine
for Lynch syndrome, a genetic cancer predisposition syndrome with highly immunogenic recurrent neoantigens
shared among cancers from different patients. Project 2 will develop and validate an LNP RNA immune
interception vaccine for patients with lung non-solid nodule (NSN) pre-malignant neoplasms, a lung
adenocarcinoma precursor lesion. To achieve these goals, we will use state-of-the-art technologies, including
LNP RNA vaccine formulation, computational genomic tumor immunology, spatial genomics and
immunopeptidomics. To ensure CRI's scientific rigor and excellence, we have assembled a scientifically
outstanding CRI External Advisory Board (EAB), which includes 2021 Lasker Award winner Drew Weissman
(Penn) for his work on LNP RNA COVID19 vaccines. Overall, the CAP-IT CRI will develop state-of-the-art LNP RNA
immunoprevention and immune interception vaccines and provide a technologically powerful platform to
jumpstart additional CAP-IT CRI LNP RNA vaccine projects. We anticipate that CAP-IT CRI will propel both
Lynch syndrome and lung NSN vaccines to NCI PREVENT and CP-NET clinical trials within the next 5 years
and FDA approval/clinical translation within ten years."

1U54CA272686-01	U54CA272686	10505611	2022	Cancer Prevention-Interception Targeted Agent Discovery Program at Fox Chase Cancer Center	"PROJECT SUMMARY - OVERALL
Hereditable cancer-predisposing mutations are estimated to be an underlying cause of more than 100,000 adult
cancers in the US each year. For many hereditary cancer syndromes, the life-time risk of developing cancer
approaches 100%. Despite revolutionary advances in “omics” technologies, our understanding of the molecular
alterations required to support the establishment of precancerous lesions and promote early tumor development
remains very limited, thus hindering the development of efficacious interventions. A multidisciplinary team of
accomplished investigators at Fox Chase Cancer Center (FCCC), with combined expertise in cancer prevention,
heritable cancer risk, cancer biology, molecular modeling, and drug discovery has been assembled to address
this unmet in an unprecedented way. The goal of the FCCC CAP-IT Center is to effectively coordinate the
development of efficacious molecularly-targeted agents for precision cancer prevention and early interception in
populations at high risk for cancer. All studies are facilitated by the unique resources of the FCCC Risk
Assessment Program, which includes over 12,000 families at high risk for cancer and 2000 confirmed germline
mutation carriers. A comprehensive pipeline for the development of agents for cancer prevention and interception
is proposed that consists of three well-developed research domains: target validation (Aim 1), agent identification
and screening (Aim 2), and pilot in vivo efficacy studies (Aim 3). Each domain will be led by a FCCC investigator,
who is a national leader in the respective field. Two highly innovative projects are proposed that illustrate the
robustness of the CAP-IT framework. Project 1 (entering at Target Validation) focuses on the development of a
newly-identified agent that refolds mutant p53. Its ability to target the TP53 mutations associated with Li-
Fraumeni Syndrome and inhibit precancerous lesions in a setting of mutant p53 will be evaluated. Project 2
(entering at Agent Identification and Screening) uniquely targets the initiated pancreatic stroma as a strategy for
early interception in the formation of pancreatic cancer. A neutralizing antibody against the stromal protein Netrin
G1, that can revert fibroblasts to a tumor-suppressive phenotype, has been discovered. Antibodies with improved
potency will be identified and tested in vivo for their ability to intercept the progression of pancreatic intraepithelial
neoplasia. All CAP-IT research and training will be strongly supported by the Leadership Team and coordinating
activities of the Administrative Core, led by Dr. Clapper. Expertise in biostatistics, bioinformatics, and data
management will be provided to CAP-IT investigators by an Informatics Core, led by Dr. Ross. Collaborations
among the NCI, FCCC and other CAP-IT Centers, as well as the sharing of data and resources through the Data
and Resource Coordination Center, will foster productivity and integration across the CAP-IT Network (Aim 4).
The long legacy of FCCC in clinical risk assessment and preclinical preventive agent development, when
combined with extensive expertise in drug design and cancer biology, makes this Center uniquely poised to be
instrumental in the discovery of molecularly-targeted agents to prevent or intercept early oncogenesis."
