5P50CA236733-05	P50CA236733	10700836	2023	Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center SPORE in Gastrointestinal Cancer	"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Overall
This application is a new submission of the Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center GI SPORE, which will focus on
colorectal cancer, the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States. Our potential for
success is high based on 1) productivity during the last cycle of our prior GI SPORE, 2) exceedingly strong
institutional support, 3) recruitment of talented investigators to the field of GI cancer through career enhancement
and developmental research funding, 4) access to unparalleled resources for drug discovery and small animal
imaging, 5) a blend of young and seasoned clinical investigators and basic scientists working together in a highly
collegial environment, 6) a committed group of patient advocates now organized into a patient advocacy council
and 7) multiple inter-SPORE, pharmaceutical, national and international horizontal and vertical collaborations.
We propose three projects and three supporting cores.
