1U24CA224285-01	U24CA224285	9455402	2017	Translational Cancer Immune Monitoring and Analysis Center (TCIMAC)	"ABSTRACT
Advances in immunotherapy have shown efficacy in various cancers. Immunotherapeutic approaches are
becoming the new treatment modality in some cancer types. However, clinical efficacy is still limited to a
marginal number of patients due to a newly developing understanding of the complex tumor microenvironment
and a limited ability to appropriately select patients who have specific biomarker signatures and have the
potential to optimally respond to specific immunotherapy or combination strategies. An additional challenge in
assessment of biomarkers that show clinical utility to predict patient benefit includes the use of different
methodologies and platforms that make it difficult to make accurate conclusions on the biomarkers in question.
Thus, optimized biomarker strategies that can overcome immune barriers will allow tailoring of the therapeutic
approaches and result in bold interventions that would be most beneficial to individual patients. The National
Cancer Moonshot was launched in 2016 with the goal of boldly combating cancer beyond incremental
advances leading to the creation of a “Cancer Immunotherapy Translational Science Network” that would
facilitate translational research and clinical advances in immunotherapy.  Our proposal to create a resource
center, named Translational Cancer Immune Monitoring and Analysis Center (TCIMAC) that will be a
critical resource capable of serving any of the NCI-supported clinical trial networks. The TCIMAC will be co-led
by Drs. Ignacio Wistuba, renowned cancer surgical and molecular pathologist, Elizabeth Mittendorf, well-known
breast cancer surgeon and immunologist, and Chantale Bernatchez, cancer immunologist. They will be
supported by a team that encompasses a multidisciplinary group of world-class and highly collaborative
experts on cancer and immunotherapy. The main goals of TCIMAC are to: 1) provide centralized and
harmonized services for sample collection, processing and quality assurance, and 2) use analytically-validated
and standardized assays and platforms to offer state-of-the-art analyses for patients enrolled on NCI-
sponsored early phase immunotherapy clinical trials. In Aim 1, we will assist in standardizing bio-banking
activities and share/develop standard operation procedures (SOPs) for biospecimen collection, processing,
quality assessment, and storage of biospecimens collected from NCI-sponsored early phase immunotherapy
clinical trials and to link the specimens to relevant clinical, pathological, immune and molecular data within the
TCIMAC-CIDC Network. In Aim 2, we will provide services to conduct both routine and innovative pathological,
immunological and molecular analyses using standardized and validated assays to aid the completion of NCI-
sponsored trials. In Aim 3, we will provide comprehensive biostatistics and computational services for data
collection and analysis for each analytical platform, and to perform analyses, interpretation and predictive
modeling of high dimensional (`omic”) data in the context of clinical outcomes. We envision that the TCIMAC
will be an indispensable element as we make meaningful progress in cancer immunotherapeutic approaches."

IMMUNE MONITORING AND ANALYSIS OF CANCER AT STANFORD (IMACS) 
 
Abstract 
The  Center  for  Immune  Monitoring  and  Analysis  of  Cancer  at  Stanford  (IMACS)  will  perform  highly 
comprehensive assays of immune phenotype and function for NCI-­identified clinical trials.  These will include 
standardized  assays  already  developed  on  CyTOF,  high-­dimensional  flow  cytometry,  Luminex,  TCRseq,  and 
RNAseq  platforms.    As  part  of  the  program  we  will  also  standardize  and  offer  as  assays  Stanford-­invented 
technologies under development, including Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging (MIBI) and Assays of Transposon-­
Accessible Chromatin (ATAC-­seq).  We have designed our center structure to work with investigators to define 
the assays best suited to the immunological questions being posed, and match these with the required sample 
types.  We will perform quality control measures on all assays, as well as generate a standard report for each 
assay  and  project.    Data  will  be  organized  via  our  online  database,  Stanford  Data  Miner,  to  ensure  data 
longevity and transferability, as well as access to both raw data files and analyzed results.  Finally, we will work 
with investigators on novel bioinformatics approaches to mining these high-­dimensional data sets.  These will 
include  approaches  designed  for  a  single  data  type  (e.g.,  viSNE  and  Citrus  for  CyTOF  and  flow  cytometry 
data), as well as approaches for integrating data across assays, using appropriate machine learning algorithms 
to aid NCI researchers in identifying immune hallmarks central to their trials. 
 
Relevance:  The IMACS center will provide access to a suite of state-­of-­the-­art immune assays, many of them 
developed  or  refined  at  Stanford.    This  unmatched  set  of  technologies  will  facilitate  the  discovery  of  new 
biomarkers  for  predicting  cancer  outcome  or  therapeutic  response,  as  well  as  defining  potential  new 
mechanisms of immune control of cancer.

1U24CA224331-01	U24CA224331	9457104	2017	Cancer Immune Monitoring and Analysis Center	"Summary
The critical role of the immune system in effecting anti-tumor responses to traditional and molecularly-targeted
therapies is increasingly recognized, such that there is now an explosion of activity in the clinical investigation
of immuno-oncology. In parallel, we have gained great advances in our ability to extract useful biologic
information from patient material through the development of: (i) high-throughput DNA/RNA sequencing, that
has uncovered major genetic determinants of clinically-evident immune responses; (ii) highly multiplexed
biological assays, that have revealed the complex interplay between immunity and cancer in relation to
therapy; and (iii) advanced computational methods, that have enabled large-scale integrative data analysis.
Underlying this activity is a need to identify the critical biomarkers of response and resistance to
therapy in each disease and across diseases. With the rapidly evolving clinical and experimental
developments in immunotherapy occurring across all major academic centers, the need to build a coordinated
infrastructure for data collection, processing and analysis has emerged as a high priority. At Dana-Farber
Cancer Institute (DFCI), the Center of Immuno-Oncology (CIO) was established several years ago and is a
local hub of translational immuno-oncology activity. As a part of its mission, the CIO supports dedicated
translational biomarker laboratories to provide expertise in the analysis of immune correlatives in the service of
immuno-oncology trials. Collectively, these resources provide multidisciplinary capabilities supporting both
investigator-initiated and externally-sponsored studies ranging from clinical trial design, the performance of
well-validated immune monitoring capabilities on patient samples during trials, the interpretation of data from
immune monitoring testing, and the development of novel assays based on the scientific questions motivated
by individual clinical studies. We propose to expand the laboratory and biostatistical capabilities of the
CIO along with those of additional DFCI units as a Cancer Immune Monitoring and Analysis Center
(CIMAC). We want to coordinate the efforts of the proposed DFCI-CIMAC with other CIMACs and with the
Cancer Immunologic Data Commons (CIDC) to develop the standards for designing studies rich with immune
correlatives and informative for candidate biomarkers, to be tested in future trials. Aim 1 focuses on
harmonizing the technical aspects of assays offered by the CIMACs; Aim 2 focuses on the assay-specific
scoring analyses and reporting of CIMAC offerings. Modeled on our long history of implementing standard and
innovative assays to study DFCI phase I/II trials, we describe a process for using `Tier 1' `shovel-ready' assays
that we expect as standard components of an immune monitoring tool-kit and `Tier 2' assays that are tailored
to the specific needs of a study (Aim 3). Altogether, these efforts fall within the concept and vision of
personalized medicine for immuno-oncology because only by the analyses of large well-annotated datasets
can we identify links between biology, molecular markers and clinical response."

1U24CA224319-01	U24CA224319	9457012	2017	High-Dimensional Immune Monitoring of NCI-Supported Immunotherapy Trials	"PROJECT SUMMARY
Immunotherapy is transforming decades of clinical practice in cancer care, but it also comes with new
questions about understanding mechanisms of action contributing to both antitumor activity and potential
associated toxicity. Most importantly, identifying why only a fraction of patients derives clinical benefit is at the
forefront of future developments, with the ever-elusive validation of useful clinical biomarkers as the ultimate
goal. As a consortium of immunologists, technologists, clinicians, computational biologists, data specialists,
and biostatisticians, the Mount Sinai CIMAC (MS-CIMAC) is uniquely positioned to generate immune profiling
datasets at an unprecedented level of granularity to identify biomarker signatures of disease course and
response to immunotherapy in cancer patients. MS-CIMAC will take full advantage of the smart cancer
immunotherapy trial designs championed by the NCI that mandate collection of baseline and on-treatment
biospecimens. Key strengths of MS-CIMAC are expected to be in unique high-dimensional yet sample-sparing
approaches, including CyTOF mass cytometry, seromics, microbiome, and multiplex chromogen IHC, thanks
to the implementation of cutting-edge yet validated protocols and analysis pipelines. Through a comprehensive
array of assays and analytical tools that bridge innovation and standardization, MS-CIMAC intends to pursue
the following three aims: a) help characterize immunocompetence at baseline and assess global immune
changes during treatment, b) drill down the specificity and quality of immune responses for mechanistic
evaluation of drugs, and c) automate, optimize, and integrate analyses of resulting datasets to facilitate
sharing, and to ultimately discover composite immune biomarkers that will impact clinical cancer care."

For this CIMAC renewal, the Stanford Cancer Immune Monitoring and Analysis Center
(CIMAC) will continue to collaborate with NCI and the CIMAC/CIDC network to identify and,
where appropriate, lead correlative studies for trials testing novel immunotherapy regimens. We
will participate in working group calls, network meetings, and coordination with clinical teams.
The Stanford CIMAC performs highly comprehensive assays of immune phenotype and
function for NCI-identified clinical trials. These will include already validated and harmonized
Tier 1 assays, validated Tier 2 assays, and newly proposed exploratory Tier 3 assays. For Tier 1
assays, we propose CyTOF, singleplex IHC, Olink, TCRseq and RNAseq. For Tier 2, we
propose single-cell TCRseq, MIBI, ATACseq, and CyTOF proteomics. For Tier 3, we propose
single-cell glycan imaging (by MALDI-ToF), spatial transcriptomics (Nanostring DSP platform),
and single-cell genomics/proteomics (Mission Bio Tapestri and BD Rhapsody platforms). We will
use longitudinal reference materials for tracking inter-batch and inter-project consistency. We
will assess quality control measures on all assays before uploading data to the Cancer Immune
Data Commons (CIDC) according to their specifications.
We will also perform biostatistical analysis of results for all assays performed, in relation to
clinical outcome data. For those trials where Stanford is the lead CIMAC, we will perform
integrative analysis across assays, using appropriate machine learning techniques and
multivariate regression algorithms such as LASSO or Elastic Net. We will work closely with the
clinical teams to obtain standardized clinical data, and to disseminate and publish results in
accordance with NCI guidelines."

Defining who is likely to respond to cancer immunotherapy and who may not benefit, due to primary/secondary
resistance or adverse events, is of critical interest for improving immuno-oncology (IO) treatments. Most clinical
trials of novel combinations either fail to include any support for complex correlative biomarker discovery, often
due to costs of specimen collection and assays, or are performed in an idiosyncratic manner, making non-
standardized data difficult to integrate as part of a larger repository. There is a need to go beyond just PD-L1
tissue expression and tumor mutation burden as FDA-approved yet imperfect predictors of immune checkpoint
blockade, by generating high-dimensional datasets that characterize the tumor immune microenvironment,
systemic circulating immune and proteomic markers from blood, and host-level immune fitness information
(microbiome). The Cancer Immune Monitoring and Analysis Centers, Cancer Immunologic Data Commons, and
Partnership for Accelerating Cancer Therapies (CIMAC-CIDC-PACT) is a Cancer Moonshot-funded network that
brings together laboratory, clinical, and computational scientists, administrators, and regulatory specialists from
four institutions, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (ISMMS), MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC),
Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI), and Stanford University. Our unprecedented, coordinated effort to conduct
IO clinical trial correlative studies and define new candidate biomarkers to improve immunotherapy had resulted
in 37 clinical trials selected in the first funding period, with ongoing datasets resulted for 17 of them. This was
achieved using rigorously assessed SOPs and processes from trial selection to data sharing. We propose to
continue and expand these efforts as follows: A set of well-established, harmonized, high-dimensional tumor and
blood-based assays will be applied to all newly selected trials, with the aim of evaluating and validating novel
biomarker of treatment, clinical response, and/or adverse events (Aim 1). To spur innovation and increase
granularity of our understanding of mechanism of action, high-tech yet validated single cell and spatial
transcriptomic technologies as well as other omics will be proposed in exceptional patients for unbiased
phenotyping, tissue composition, architectural organization, and immune profiling (Aim 2). The resulting unified
data repository will be mined to define multi-omic and cross-trial markers, through biostatistical and
computational innovative design to integrate datasets from various assays into higher analytical archetypes
across studies (Aim 3). Together, our network is at the forefront of immune monitoring standards, by balancing
innovation with reproducibility, to comprehensively assess biomarkers and strive for precision cancer treatment.
We are poised to create an unparalleled resource of harmonized, clinically annotated datasets shared with the
public that will establish best practice guidelines with the research community. Through rigorous implementation
of state-of-the-art, cross-compared platforms, the CIMAC-CIDC initiative aims to accelerate identification of
clinically actionable biomarkers of response, resistance, and adverse events, and define mechanisms at play."	16S ribosomal RNA sequencing;Acceleration;Achievement;Administrator;Adverse event;Agreement;Antigens;Architecture;Biological Assay;Biological Markers;Biometry;Blood;Cancer Center;Cell Therapy;Cells;Characteristics;Clinical;Clinical Trials;Collaborations;Communities;Complex;Correlative Study;Dana-Farber Cancer Institute;Data;Data Commons;Data Scientist;Data Set;Dedications;Ensure;FDA approved;Fruit;Funding;Genetic;Goals;Heart;Hematologic Neoplasms;Human;Human Resources;Immune;Immunologic Monitoring;Immunologics;Immunologist;Immunooncology;Immunotherapy;Institution;Joints;Knowledge;Laboratories;Leadership;Malignant Neoplasms;Manuscripts;Methodology;Mission;Modality;Modeling;Molecular;Molecular Profiling;Mutation;Outcome;Output;Pathologist;Pathology;Pathway interactions;Patients;Phenotype;Play;Postdoctoral Fellow;Practice Guidelines;Procedures;Process;Prognostic Marker;Proteomics;Protocols documentation;Recommendation;Reproducibility;Research;Resistance;Resources;Sampling;Scientist;Serum;Solid Neoplasm;Specialist;Specimen;Standardization;T cell receptor repertoire sequencing;Technology;Thinking;Time;Tissues;Tumor Tissue;Universities;Viral;Work;biomarker discovery;cancer clinical trial;cancer immunotherapy;cancer therapy;candidate marker;clinically actionable;complex data;cost;data integration;data repository;data sharing;demographics;design;early phase clinical trial;empowerment;exceptional responders;expectation;fitness;high dimensionality;immune checkpoint;immune checkpoint blockade;immunotherapy clinical trials;immunotherapy trials;improved;innovation;interest;machine learning method;medical schools;microbiome;multidimensional data;multiple omics;new therapeutic target;next generation;novel;novel marker;pharmacodynamic biomarker;predictive marker;programmed cell death ligand 1;programs;repository;response;response biomarker;sample collection;technology platoform;transcriptome sequencing;transcriptomics;tumor;tumor-immune system interactions	ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI	NEW YORK	NY	UNITED STATES	Sacha Gnjatic, Seunghee Kim-Schulze	Min-Kyung H Song	1983570	1983570	2023-07-21T12:07:00Z	2017-09-30T12:09:00Z	2028-06-30T12:06:00Z	RFA-CA-22-038	nofo_RFA-CA-22-038
