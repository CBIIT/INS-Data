High-dimensional molecular profiling, including genomic sequencing and digital pathology, has revolutionized
our understanding of cancer and has led to the identification of multiple new targets and biomarkers. However,
barriers impede unlocking the full potential of these data because most ‘omic data generated from National
Cancer Institute’s National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN) clinical trials are decentralized, with data housed at a
variety of sites and analyses taking place locally. To overcome these barriers for Alliance NCTN cooperative
group trials, in 2020 we established A-STOR: Alliance Standardized Translational Omics Resource, a secure,
HIPAA-compliant centralized repository of raw, and processed genomic and pathology image data from Alliance
clinical trials, with standardized genomic data harmonization to facilitate cross-study analyses. In this proposal
(a supplement to the Alliance U10 grant), we aim to realize the potential of A-STOR for artificial intelligence
(AI)/machine learning (ML) modeling by rapidly expanding our existing infrastructure to: host data from over a
dozen existing or ongoing Alliance/NCTN clinical trials (Aim 1), optimize infrastructure for cloud-based AI/ML
analyses including engagement with and feedback from AI/ML applications (Aim 1-2), ensure FAIR principles in
developing a unified clinical and adverse event (AE) data dictionary to facilitate clinical data harmonization (Aim
2), and complete an already-approved pooled multi-modal ML-based predictor as a pilot study (Aim 3). The
impact of these aims will collectively capitalize on the expertise of Alliance A-STOR Co-Chairs Dr. Daniel Stover
(clinical informatics, genomics) and Dr. James Blachly (computational biology, computer science), to optimize
foundational infrastructure, clinical/AE harmonization to facilitate data reuse as part of AI/ML efforts, and cloud-
based AI/ML compute optimization for data generated through Alliance NCTN cancer clinical trials."

The major emphases of the USC team are (a) to provide leadership across the NTCN to design and efficiently perform clinical trials evaluating the safety and efficacy of novel regimens or modifications of existing regimens; (b) to provide leadership in biomarker development and in integration of new technologies into NCTN trials, taking advantage of a systematic approach to collection, processing, and storage of blood, normal tissue, fresh or frozen tumor tissue, and other relevant biologic samples for molecular and pharmacologic studies; and (c) to evaluate cancer treatment regimens in special patient populations, such as rare cancers, the elderly and ethnic minorities. USC investigators have not only contributed extensively to SWOG trials but have demonstrated administrative/academic leadership, facilitating the translation of specific themes of investigation to SWOG. Recent SWOG trials evaluating the predictive role of ERCC1 expression in the outcome of patients with metastatic gastric cancer and the role of CTC enumeration and telomerase activity in prostate cancer highlight one aspect of the scientific leadership that USC investigators have provided in the NCI cooperative group system. They have also played an active role in NCI task forces and steering committees.

5U10CA031946-32	U10CA031946	8461702	2013	Cancer and Leukemia Group B	DESCRIPTION (Provided by applicant):  The CALGB is comprised of 26 academic medical centers and over 200 affiliated community hospitals joined in the pursuit of improved cancer treatment and better understanding of tumor biology and cancer treatment outcomes via the conduct of controlled clinical trials. Over 4,000 members of the Group including oncology physicians, radiologists, pathologists, statisticians, clinical research associates, oncology nurses, pharmacists, health outcomes researchers, and basic scientists participate in these studies. From 25-30 phase III protocols are active at any one time, along with phase II and phase I studies that provide preliminary data required for the appropriate design of large scale randomized trials. Multidisciplinary disease committees of the Group design and implement protocols for the treatment of patients with leukemia, lymphoma, breast, respiratory, Gl and GU cancer. Modality committees, including Leukemia Correlative Sciences, Imaging, Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, Surgery, Transplant, Cancer in the Elderly, Cancer Control and Health Outcomes, and Oncology Nursing provide expertise that enhances the contribution of these disciplines to CALGB studies. Scientific resources committees, including Clinical Research Associates, Pathology and Radiation Oncology, provide essential quality assurance and training activities for the Group. Major areas of emphasis in CALGB include development of innovative treatments for patients with cancer; studies of molecular predictors of prognosis and response to therapy; studies of the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and pharmacogenetics of new and established anticancer drugs; evaluation of minimally invasive surgical techniques and novel imaging technologies; determining the cost and cost-effectiveness of new cancer therapies; evaluating the impact of cancer and its treatment on the quality of life of cancer patients and their caregivers; developing new strategies for cancer prevention; and addressing the needs of special populations, particularly minorities and the elderly. A new core facility in cancer imaging was established to provide central review and archiving of PET and CT images and to set standards for image acquisition and transmission at CALGB institutions. Three new molecular reference laboratories are proposed in this application to provide biomarker assessments that are necessary to determine patient eligibility or treatment assignment in CALGB studies of targeted therapies. Three established biorepositories collect, archive and distribute frozen and paraffin-embedded solid tumor tissues, leukemia cells, plasma, serum, urine and DNA for correlative science studies.

Modality committees, including Leukemia Correlative Sciences, Imaging, Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, Surgery, Transplant, Cancer in the Elderly, Cancer Control and Health Outcomes, and Oncology Nursing provide expertise that enhances the contribution of these disciplines to CALGB studies. Scientific resources committees, including Clinical Research Associates, Pathology and Radiation Oncology, provide essential quality assurance and training activities for the Group. Major areas of emphasis in CALGB include development of innovative treatments for patients with cancer; studies of molecular predictors of prognosis and response to therapy; studies of the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and pharmacogenetics of new and established anticancer drugs; evaluation of minimally invasive surgical techniques and novel imaging technologies; determining the cost and cost-effectiveness of new cancer therapies; evaluating the impact of cancer and its treatment on the quality of life of cancer patients and their caregivers; developing new strategies for cancer prevention; and addressing the needs of special populations, particularly minorities and the elderly. A new core facility in cancer imaging was established to provide central review and archiving of PET and CT images and to set standards for image acquisition and transmission at CALGB institutions. Three new molecular reference laboratories are proposed in this application to provide biomarker assessments that are necessary to determine patient eligibility or treatment assignment in CALGB studies of targeted therapies. Three established biorepositories collect, archive and distribute frozen and paraffin-embedded solid tumor tissues, leukemia cells, plasma, serum, urine and DNA for correlative science studies.
