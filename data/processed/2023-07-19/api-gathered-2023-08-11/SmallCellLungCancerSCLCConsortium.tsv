The overarching goal of the NCI Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC) Coordinating Center has been to “break the
logjam” of fundamental knowledge gaps resulting in a 30+ year lack of progress on this lethal malignancy that
was designated a “recalcitrant cancer” by the US Congress and NCI. Our U24 Coordinating Center has done
this by promoting and facilitating information sharing, interaction, and collaborative research among NCI-
supported investigators studying SCLC. Over our initial five years of support, this Coordinating Center has
significantly increased research progress within the SCLC research community through efforts including, but not
limited to, the creation and ongoing expansion of comprehensive preclinical and clinical -omics databases,
centralized annotation and cataloging of available SCLC models, distribution and sharing of such models,
centralized data analytics, a centralized Consortium website, initiation and coordination of an interactive work-
in-progress (“WIPs”) forum as well as planning and oversight of annual meetings. Of all of this, the role of the
Coordinating Center in facilitating interactive WIPs (usually with ~100 attendees from dozens of institutions
including patient advocates) with unprecedented information and resource sharing, has made possible
tremendous progress in overcoming knowledge gaps, all of which are documented in a large number of peer
reviewed publications. This renewal application will continue the exceptional research momentum the SCLC
Consortium has generated, and build on this initial success through support of new initiatives. These include
centralized support for databasing and comparative analysis of genetically-engineered mouse models (GEMMs),
and multi-parameter characterization of patient-derived xenograft models developed across the Consortium.
These additional resources will be of direct utility to the SCLC research community. As part of the U24 renewal,
given the remarkable growth in scope and diversity of SCLC research, we have developed a new multi-PI
structure including Charles Rudin (MSK), John Minna (UTSW), with addition of two exciting young SCLC
investigators who have contributed important new insights into SCLC molecular and cellular biology - Trudy
Oliver (University of Utah), and Lauren Byers (MDACC). All four have been personally very active both in the
U24 activities and in their own individual SCLC U01 and R01 research. The complementary strengths of this
leadership team cover all of the important areas of SCLC basic, translational, and clinical trials research. Dr.
Rudin will continue as contact PI, providing administrative leadership and coordination. We emphasize that the
products of the Consortium will ultimately benefit human health through fostering development of novel strategies
for disease prevention, early intervention, immune surveillance, metastasis suppression, and therapeutics."

5U01CA235625-05	U01CA235625	10641667	2023	Employing CRISPR inactivation screening and in vivo models towards improving treatments for SCLC	"SUMMARY
With a lack of druggable oncogenic mutations in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and no approved targeted
therapies, we need to identify new treatment approaches for SCLC. In this proposal, we apply whole genome
CRISPR inactivation screens to identify genes that are essential for SCLC broadly, or for key genetically defined
subsets. We then determine whether pharmacologic inhibition of identified hits also results in selective killing of
SCLC cells. We apply in vivo systems including patient derived xenograft (PDX) and genetically engineered
mouse models to test pharmacologic inhibitors of key targets identified in these genetic screens. Aim 1 will focus
on a pathway that we already identified using CRISPR inactivation screens to be essential for Rb/p53-mutant
SCLC cells. Components of a NEDD8/RBX1 pathway, controlling Cullin activity and protein ubiquitylation, were
essential for SCLC cells. Pharmacologic inhibition of NEDD8 activating enzyme (NAE) using MLN4924 in patient
derived xenograft (PDX) models confirmed reliance of SCLC cells on this pathway. Excitingly, we identified
examples of exceptional responses to MLN4924 in some PDX models. Aim 1: Apply in vivo models to direct
NEDD8 inhibition to subsets of SCLC most likely to respond. Here, we explore the potential for inhibiting
the NEDD8 pathway in SCLC. We will combine NAE inhibition with cisplatin-etoposide chemotherapy and
determine whether durable responses result. Some SCLC PDX models exhibited exquisite sensitivity to NAE
inhibition; we will identify underlying mechanisms and genetic features of super-responding PDX models that
could be used to help predict exceptional responders. We will determine whether NAE inhibition should be
directed to all SCLC patients, or to key subsets, and whether this approach augments response to chemotherapy.
MLN4924 is already being tested in clinical trials for other cancer types and this work could rapidly lead to clinical
trials in SCLC. Aim 2: Apply CRISPR inactivation screens to identify new therapeutic targets for SCLC.
This Aim will extend our CRISPR inactivation screens to include mouse SCLC cell lines with key driver mutations
beyond Rb/p53, including Pten, Crebbp and Mycl. Our approach takes advantage of the fact that while human
SCLC has an extremely high mutational burden, leading to extensive heterogeneity among SCLC with a given
driver mutation, mouse SCLC with defined driver alterations are more homogenous, increasing signal to noise
in identifying vulnerabilities. We will identify dependencies in genetically-defined subsets of SCLC and will test
inhibitors of identified druggable targets in PDX and GEM models that harbor defined genetic alterations. We
leverage available mouse models and derived cell lines, along with a bank of genetically annotated PDX models,
studied in vivo and ex vivo, to identify and evaluate completely new ways to target key genetic subsets of SCLC."

5U01CA242919-05	U01CA242919	10693821	2023	Exploiting POU2F3 addiction in the tuft cell variant of small cell lung cancer	"Project Summary
Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is the most aggressive form of lung cancer, which is associated with a high mitotic
rate, early metastatic spread, and a rapid evolution of chemotherapy resistance. We recently discovered a novel
form of SCLC that resembles the tuft cell lineage, which can be distinguished from the classical neuroendocrine
form of this disease through immunohistochemical staining of POU2F3. Importantly, we have identified several
molecular vulnerabilities that are specific to the variant form of this disease. In this research proposal, we seek
to advance personalized therapies that exploit the unique lineage program present in the tuft cell variant of SCLC.
Our innovative functional genomics strategy has already uncovered actionable dependencies that are unique to
tuft cell variant of SCLC, such as the kinase IGF1R. In addition, we discovered a profound addiction of tuft cell
variant SCLC tumors to POU2F3. Here we will investigate the molecular basis of POU2F3 addiction in SCLC,
with the explicit intent to develop small molecules that interfere with POU2F3 function. The first Aim of this
proposal will build upon the extensive epigenomic analyses we have performed in SCLC, which has defined a
unique enhancer landscape sustained by POU2F3 in this disease. We will now employ two independent
functional approaches to elucidate the critical POU2F3 binding sites/enhancers in the genome of SCLC cells,
which will be leveraged to pinpoint the critical components of the tuft cell lineage circuit that might be targeted
therapeutically. The second Aim will evaluate POU2F3 cofactors, which we have already nominated via an
innovative ChIP-SICAP-mass spectrometry analysis of endogenous POU2F3 binding sites. We will perform
CRISPR exon scanning and biochemical analysis of each cofactor to define the critical POU2F3:cofactor
interactions that selectively support this malignancy. The final Aim of this proposal will employ functional
genomics to devise drug combinations with the IGF1R inhibitor linsitinib that are rational and exploit synthetic-
lethal genetic interactions. We will also employ our latest CRISPR innovation, homolog co-targeting CRISPR
screens, to expose redundant kinase vulnerabilities that are linked with neuroendocrine versus tuft cell variants
of SCLC. In summary, we estimate that the tuft cell-like variant is present in ~18% of SCLC cases, which
corresponds to approximately 5,000 newly diagnosed SCLC cases and approximately 3,500 deaths in the United
States alone each year. Hence, the proposed research could lead to a sustained impact that affects a large
patient population for which novel medicines are desperately needed."

5U01CA220323-05	U01CA220323	10456908	2022	Using patient-derived models to understand drug responses in SCLC	"PROJECT SUMMARY
Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) afflicts more than 30,000 patients per year and is rapidly fatal in 95% of cases,
with median survival is less than one year. Belying this grim prognosis, treatment-naive SCLC is highly
sensitive to chemotherapy, with response rates in excess of 70% for etoposide/platinum. However, relapse is
nearly inevitable, and relapsed SCLC presents two obstacles that have been insurmountable for at least 30
years: cross-resistance to chemotherapy, and absence of biomarker-driven targeted therapy.
Following relapse, resistance often extends beyond etoposide/platinum, and a disease that was once highly
chemosensitive becomes inexorably progressive. However, the molecular determinants of cross-resistance in
SCLC remain unclear. Although critically important, cross-resistance is difficult to study experimentally, as it
requires a model system that faithfully reproduces clinical outcomes.
Topotecan is the only approved second-line therapy, but NCCN guidelines list 10 agents of nearly equivalent
efficacy. None are particularly effective in unselected patients, and although there is significant molecular
heterogeneity in SCLC, this does not guide patient selection. As novel targets and therapeutic regimens
emerge, biomarker discovery will require a model system that recapitulates the molecular features of patient
tumors, so that molecular heterogeneity can be parsed into clinically meaningful subgroups.
We have generated a panel of 44 SCLC patient-derived xenograft models (PDXs) from biopsy specimens and
circulating tumor cells (CTCs). Our panel includes successive models from individual patients at time points
before and after specific lines of therapy, with detailed information about the corresponding clinical response.
For both standard chemotherapy and experimental agents in clinical trial, these models faithfully mirror patient
responses. However, unlike the patient experience, multiple strategies can be compared for identical tumors.
We propose to use these models to directly compare standard first and second-line chemotherapy with two
experimental regimens that have given promising results in the clinic or in preclinical assays: olaparib plus
temozolomide, in a phase I/II trial at MGH, and a combined Mcl-1/Bcl-2 inhibitors. Individually, these PDX
population trials are designed to reveal biomarkers of sensitivity and mechanisms of resistance for promising
experimental therapies. Collectively, they present a novel opportunity to model cross-resistance through
comparative analysis with reference to the clinical histories of each model.
The successful completion of this work will establish a large collection of PDX models with comprehensive
molecular an functional profiles. In addition, these experiments will investigate the molecular determinants of
cross-resistance following chemotherapy, a problem that has beleaguered management of SCLC for over
three decades."

5U01CA231776-05	U01CA231776	10469686	2022	Bioinformatic-Chemical Approach to Credential Molecular Targets to Combat Rapid Chemo-Radiation Resistance in SCLC	"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Limited stage small cell lung cancer (LS SCLC), the only curable form of SCLC, is remarkably sensitive to
etoposide plus cisplatin combined with thoracic radiotherapy with response rates > 70%; however, therapy-
refractory recurrence is common. LS SCLC has less than a 25% 5-year overall survival (OS) and ultimately a
strategy for improving long-term SCLC outcomes needs to successfully target tumor cell populations that
survive standard therapy and give rise to recurrent disease. There is, however, a considerable gap in
understanding the specific mechanisms responsible for chemoradiotherapy resistance in SCLC. Our project is
unique among the current portfolio of SCLC funded programs in that we have focused on
chemoradioresistance to increase cure rates in LS SCLC. Recently, our work has suggested using patient-
derived xenograft (PDX) models of SCLC may be an important tool to elucidate mechanisms of therapy
resistance. This approach was remarkably successful, identifying a tolerable and strongly synergistic anti-
SCLC interaction that led to a CTEP-approved trial based on our preclinical data - (NCI #10070; Study Chair:
Hann). In this research program, we will test key hypotheses via three specific aims that will provide more
mechanistic insights into the rapidly emergent chemoradiation resistance observed in LS SCLC.
One central hypothesis of this proposal is that adaptive gene expression changes mediate rapid emergence of
the chemoradiation resistance phenotype in LS SCLC. We have developed a novel chemoradiation treatment
regimen with SCLC PDX models to facilitate these studies. Development and characterization of this novel
model involves a unique collaboration between medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, bioinformaticians,
medical physicists, veterinarians and molecular/cell biologists that is extremely well suited to develop an
integrated program dedicated to resolving questions of SCLC chemoradioresistance. Finally, we have already
identified novel gene targets that are correlated with SCLC chemoradioresistance.
Our research program is organized as follows: Aim #1: Characterize natural history of response of
experimental models of SCLC to chemoradiation in vivo. We will determine response rates and recurrence
patterns of a panel of SCLC PDXs and transgenic mouse models. Aim #2: Characterization of molecular
underpinnings of SCLC chemoradiation resistance. We will reconstruct gene regulatory networks and gene
expression profiles associated with chemoradiation resistance and develop small-scale predictive classifiers for
therapy response to be validated in follow-up studies. Aim #3: Pharmacologic and genetic validation of
candidate genes for SCLC chemoradiation resistance in vitro and in vivo. We will validate our novel gene
candidates for conferring chemoradiation resistance using pharmacologic and genetic approach with SCLC
PDX-derived organoids and SCLC transgenic mouse models."

Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is responsible for over 30,000 deaths each year in the United States alone.
SCLC has a two-year survival rate of ~6% and unlike the other major subtypes of lung cancer, there are
currently no targeted therapies approved for SCLC. SCLC is initially highly responsive to chemotherapy, but
rapidly develops resistance leading to mortality in ~10 months. Clearly, a major unmet need for the treatment
of SCLC is the identification of new therapeutic targets and treatment strategies to combat chemo-resistant
disease. Our understanding of chemotherapy resistance mechanisms has been hampered by a lack of
relapsed human SCLC tissue due to rare surgical resections. In addition, there have been few mouse models
of the disease that exhibit short latencies and chemo-sensitivity. To address these challenges, we performed
whole exome sequencing on relapsed SCLC from 30 patients. Relapse-specific genomic alterations in the
WNT/APC/β-catenin pathway were identified in ~66% of relapsed SCLC suggesting that this pathway
promotes chemo-resistance. Second, we developed a novel mouse model of SCLC driven by loss of Rb1,
Trp53 and overexpression of Myc—three of the most common genetic alterations in the human disease. Mice
develop SCLC within weeks that highly resembles the human disease at the level of histopathology, biomarker
expression and chemo-sensitivity followed by relapse. This model will be a useful tool to test candidate
chemotherapy resistance mechanisms and identify novel therapeutic targets that inhibit chemo-resistance. The
objective of this study is to use this novel mouse model and comprehensive genomic analyses of primary and
relapsed human SCLC to identify mechanisms of chemotherapy resistance and novel therapeutic targets to
combat chemo-resistant disease. We hypothesize that activation of the WNT/β-catenin pathway promotes
chemo-resistance in SCLC and that targeted inhibition of the pathway will inhibit chemo-resistant disease. We
predict that expansion of our genomic and transcriptomic profiling will identify additional novel pathways
involved in chemo-resistance. To test these hypotheses, we will: 1) identify recurrent pathway alterations in
relapsed human and mouse SCLC using whole genome, exome, transcriptome and epigenome sequencing
and 2) functionally determine whether canonical WNT/β-catenin signaling and other candidate pathways are
necessary and sufficient for chemo-resistance in SCLC in vivo. This approach is innovative because we will
employ unbiased comprehensive genomic and epigenomic analyses on relapsed human SCLC and a novel
immune-competent mouse model of SCLC that recapitulates key features of the human disease. The WNT/β-
catenin pathway is largely unexplored in SCLC. This research is significant because there are currently no
targeted therapies approved for SCLC. A better understanding of the critical pathways driving chemo-
resistance in SCLC will impact the treatment and survival of patients with this intractable disease."

Limited stage small cell lung cancer (LS SCLC), the only curable form of SCLC, is remarkably sensitive to
etoposide plus cisplatin combined with thoracic radiotherapy with response rates > 70%; however, therapy-
refractory recurrence is common. LS SCLC has less than a 25% 5-year overall survival (OS) and ultimately a
strategy for improving long-term SCLC outcomes needs to successfully target tumor cell populations that
survive standard therapy and give rise to recurrent disease. There is, however, a considerable gap in
understanding the specific mechanisms responsible for chemoradiotherapy resistance in SCLC. Our project is
unique among the current portfolio of SCLC funded programs in that we have focused on
chemoradioresistance to increase cure rates in LS SCLC. Recently, our work has suggested using patient-
derived xenograft (PDX) models of SCLC may be an important tool to elucidate mechanisms of therapy
resistance. This approach was remarkably successful, identifying a tolerable and strongly synergistic anti-
SCLC interaction that led to a CTEP-approved trial based on our preclinical data - (NCI #10070; Study Chair:
Hann). In this research program, we will test key hypotheses via three specific aims that will provide more
mechanistic insights into the rapidly emergent chemoradiation resistance observed in LS SCLC.
One central hypothesis of this proposal is that adaptive gene expression changes mediate rapid emergence of
the chemoradiation resistance phenotype in LS SCLC. We have developed a novel chemoradiation treatment
regimen with SCLC PDX models to facilitate these studies. Development and characterization of this novel
model involves a unique collaboration between medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, bioinformaticians,
medical physicists, veterinarians and molecular/cell biologists that is extremely well suited to develop an
integrated program dedicated to resolving questions of SCLC chemoradioresistance. Finally, we have already
identified novel gene targets that are correlated with SCLC chemoradioresistance.
Our research program is organized as follows: Aim #1: Characterize natural history of response of
experimental models of SCLC to chemoradiation in vivo. We will determine response rates and recurrence
patterns of a panel of SCLC PDXs and transgenic mouse models. Aim #2: Characterization of molecular
underpinnings of SCLC chemoradiation resistance. We will reconstruct gene regulatory networks and gene
expression profiles associated with chemoradiation resistance and develop small-scale predictive classifiers for
therapy response to be validated in follow-up studies. Aim #3: Pharmacologic and genetic validation of
candidate genes for SCLC chemoradiation resistance in vitro and in vivo. We will validate our novel gene
candidates for conferring chemoradiation resistance using pharmacologic and genetic approach with SCLC
PDX-derived organoids and SCLC transgenic mouse models."

5U01CA242919-04	U01CA242919	10450100	2022	Exploiting POU2F3 addiction in the tuft cell variant of small cell lung cancer	"Project Summary
Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is the most aggressive form of lung cancer, which is associated with a high mitotic
rate, early metastatic spread, and a rapid evolution of chemotherapy resistance. We recently discovered a novel
form of SCLC that resembles the tuft cell lineage, which can be distinguished from the classical neuroendocrine
form of this disease through immunohistochemical staining of POU2F3. Importantly, we have identified several
molecular vulnerabilities that are specific to the variant form of this disease. In this research proposal, we seek
to advance personalized therapies that exploit the unique lineage program present in the tuft cell variant of SCLC.
Our innovative functional genomics strategy has already uncovered actionable dependencies that are unique to
tuft cell variant of SCLC, such as the kinase IGF1R. In addition, we discovered a profound addiction of tuft cell
variant SCLC tumors to POU2F3. Here we will investigate the molecular basis of POU2F3 addiction in SCLC,
with the explicit intent to develop small molecules that interfere with POU2F3 function. The first Aim of this
proposal will build upon the extensive epigenomic analyses we have performed in SCLC, which has defined a
unique enhancer landscape sustained by POU2F3 in this disease. We will now employ two independent
functional approaches to elucidate the critical POU2F3 binding sites/enhancers in the genome of SCLC cells,
which will be leveraged to pinpoint the critical components of the tuft cell lineage circuit that might be targeted
therapeutically. The second Aim will evaluate POU2F3 cofactors, which we have already nominated via an
innovative ChIP-SICAP-mass spectrometry analysis of endogenous POU2F3 binding sites. We will perform
CRISPR exon scanning and biochemical analysis of each cofactor to define the critical POU2F3:cofactor
interactions that selectively support this malignancy. The final Aim of this proposal will employ functional
genomics to devise drug combinations with the IGF1R inhibitor linsitinib that are rational and exploit synthetic-
lethal genetic interactions. We will also employ our latest CRISPR innovation, homolog co-targeting CRISPR
screens, to expose redundant kinase vulnerabilities that are linked with neuroendocrine versus tuft cell variants
of SCLC. In summary, we estimate that the tuft cell-like variant is present in ~18% of SCLC cases, which
corresponds to approximately 5,000 newly diagnosed SCLC cases and approximately 3,500 deaths in the United
States alone each year. Hence, the proposed research could lead to a sustained impact that affects a large
patient population for which novel medicines are desperately needed."

5U01CA213359-05	U01CA213359	10172863	2021	Clinical development of a DLL3-targeted theranostic for small cell lung cancer	"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is remarkable for exceptionally high metastatic potential, initial robust
response to DNA damaging agents, and near universal development of resistance. This combination of
predilection for early metastasis acquired treatment resistance – often times manifested as cross resistance to
multiple agents – highlights a critical need for novel systemic therapies operating through a novel mechanism
in order to achieve improved patient outcomes.
 Delta-like ligand 3 (DLL3), has recently been identified as a therapeutic target in SCLC. The highly
tumor-selective surface expression of this protein make it an excellent candidate target for an antibody drug
conjugate (ADC). Rovalpituzumab tesserine (Rova-T) is one such ADC that is showing encouraging efficacy
signals in the clinic. However, despite apparent clinical benefit, this agent has also been associated with some
severe adverse events attributable to the presence of the anthracycline PBD warhead. DLL3 targeting
approaches are in need of both a real-time, quantitative diagnostic biomarker and a therapeutic approach with
reduced toxicity.
 We propose a theranostic approach comprising on 89Zr immunoPET and a 90Y/177Lu
radioimmunotherapeutic. The first Aim improves upon already promising bioconjugation chemistry. We are
already able to obtain high-contrast immunoPET images using non-specific amine labeling and site-specific
maleimide bioconjugation. We will improve upon this approach by developing more stable thiol-clickable
methylsuflone chelators for 89Zr and 90Y/177Lu to minimize kidney dose. The second Aim identifies preclinical
dosing parameters and comprehensively optimizes efficacy and toxicity in a traditional cell line xenograft. Our
preliminary imaging data is focused on H82, an SCLC cell lined derived from a chemoexperienced patient. This
cell line is very resistant to etoposide in vitro and in vivo and will be used to identify a radiotherapy dose that
demonstrates efficacy in vivo, while minimizing dose to the kidney. Different dose ranges and schedules will be
explored. The final Aim explores radiotherapy in a variety of in vivo contexts including lesion sizes ranging from
0.1 to 10 mm in diameter and representing both chemonaïve and chemoresistant disease. Radioisotopes have
different energy deposition depending on the volume of the tumor being targeted. We will evaluate 90Y and
177Lu radioisotopes in different in vivo models of small cell lung cancer for the ability to eradicate lesions of
different sizes. A unique resource in the lab is our collection of 10 paired chemonaïve and chemoresistant
patient-derived xenograft lines. We will place particular emphasis on establishing efficacy in the context of
acquired chemoresistance.
 Data obtained in this study should provide preclinical evidence in support of clinical translation of a
DLL3 targeting theranostic based on rovalpituzumab."	90Y;Amines;Anthracycline;Antibodies;Antibody-drug conjugates;Biodistribution;Caliber;Cancer cell line;Cell Line;Cell surface;Central Nervous System Diseases;Chelating Agents;Chemistry;Chemoresistance;Clinic;Clinical;Clinical Trials;Collection;Cysteine;DNA Damage;DNA Minor Groove Binding Agent;Data;Deferoxamine;Deposition;Diagnosis;Disease;Dose;Etoposide;Exposure to;Extensive Stage;FDA approved;Goals;Image;ImmunoPET;In Vitro;Kidney;Label;Lead;Lesion;Ligands;Lutetium;Maleimides;Malignant Neoplasms;Malignant neoplasm of lung;Metastatic/Recurrent;Methods;Micrometastasis;Molecular;Mus;Neoplasm Metastasis;Patient Selection;Patient-Focused Outcomes;Patients;Pentetic Acid;Performance;Pericardial body location;Peritoneal;Pharmacodynamics;Pleural;Population;Positron;Pre-Clinical Model;Prognosis;Proteins;Radiation Tolerance;Radiation therapy;Radioconjugate;Radioimmunoconjugate;Radioimmunotherapy;Radioisotopes;Recurrence;Refractory;Resistance;Resistance development;Resources;Route;Schedule;Serious Adverse Event;Serum;Signal Transduction;Site;Specificity;Sulfhydryl Compounds;Surface;Systemic Therapy;Therapeutic;Therapeutic Index;Time;Toxic effect;Toxicology;Toxin;Treatment Protocols;Tumor Volume;United States;Work;Xenograft procedure;Zirconium;acquired treatment resistance;base;chemical synthesis;clinical development;clinical translation;companion diagnostics;design;diagnostic biomarker;efficacy evaluation;efficacy study;effusion;first-in-human;imaging agent;immunoreactivity;improved;in vivo;in vivo Model;lung small cell carcinoma;novel;novel therapeutic intervention;novel therapeutics;patient derived xenograft model;pre-clinical;preclinical imaging;protein expression;response;targeted agent;targeted treatment;theranostics;therapeutic target;tumor;tumor specificity	NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE	NEW YORK	NY	UNITED STATES	John Thomas Poirier	Jacek Capala	335437	335437	2020-12-07T12:12:00Z	2017-02-15T12:02:00Z	2023-01-31T12:01:00Z	PAR-16-049	nofo_PAR-16-049
5U01CA231844-04	U01CA231844	10241343	2021	Genomic and Functional Identification of Chemotherapy Resistance Mechanisms in Small Cell Lung Cancer	"Project Summary
Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is responsible for over 30,000 deaths each year in the United States alone.
SCLC has a two-year survival rate of ~6% and unlike the other major subtypes of lung cancer, there are
currently no targeted therapies approved for SCLC. SCLC is initially highly responsive to chemotherapy, but
rapidly develops resistance leading to mortality in ~10 months. Clearly, a major unmet need for the treatment
of SCLC is the identification of new therapeutic targets and treatment strategies to combat chemo-resistant
disease. Our understanding of chemotherapy resistance mechanisms has been hampered by a lack of
relapsed human SCLC tissue due to rare surgical resections. In addition, there have been few mouse models
of the disease that exhibit short latencies and chemo-sensitivity. To address these challenges, we performed
whole exome sequencing on relapsed SCLC from 30 patients. Relapse-specific genomic alterations in the
WNT/APC/β-catenin pathway were identified in ~66% of relapsed SCLC suggesting that this pathway
promotes chemo-resistance. Second, we developed a novel mouse model of SCLC driven by loss of Rb1,
Trp53 and overexpression of Myc—three of the most common genetic alterations in the human disease. Mice
develop SCLC within weeks that highly resembles the human disease at the level of histopathology, biomarker
expression and chemo-sensitivity followed by relapse. This model will be a useful tool to test candidate
chemotherapy resistance mechanisms and identify novel therapeutic targets that inhibit chemo-resistance. The
objective of this study is to use this novel mouse model and comprehensive genomic analyses of primary and
relapsed human SCLC to identify mechanisms of chemotherapy resistance and novel therapeutic targets to
combat chemo-resistant disease. We hypothesize that activation of the WNT/β-catenin pathway promotes
chemo-resistance in SCLC and that targeted inhibition of the pathway will inhibit chemo-resistant disease. We
predict that expansion of our genomic and transcriptomic profiling will identify additional novel pathways
involved in chemo-resistance. To test these hypotheses, we will: 1) identify recurrent pathway alterations in
relapsed human and mouse SCLC using whole genome, exome, transcriptome and epigenome sequencing
and 2) functionally determine whether canonical WNT/β-catenin signaling and other candidate pathways are
necessary and sufficient for chemo-resistance in SCLC in vivo. This approach is innovative because we will
employ unbiased comprehensive genomic and epigenomic analyses on relapsed human SCLC and a novel
immune-competent mouse model of SCLC that recapitulates key features of the human disease. The WNT/β-
catenin pathway is largely unexplored in SCLC. This research is significant because there are currently no
targeted therapies approved for SCLC. A better understanding of the critical pathways driving chemo-
resistance in SCLC will impact the treatment and survival of patients with this intractable disease."

This application focuses on developing new targeted therapy for SCLC focusing on two key lineage oncogenes
involved in SCLC pathogenesis and malignant behavior, ASCL1 and NEUROD1. Nearly 90% of SCLCs
express ASCL1, NEUROD1 or both. In the preclinical models, including human SCLC lines and xenografts and
genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) of SCLC, tumors that express either ASCL1 or NEUROD1
appear “addicted” to their expression and function. The presence of ASCL1 or NEUROD1 also are associated
with expression of important downstream oncogenes and regulatory genes. If ASCL1/NEUROD1 are removed
(through genetic knockdown) SCLCs undergo many logs of tumor cell kill. Using state of the art technology in
human preclinical models, we propose to systematically study the dependency of a large number of SCLC
lines and xenografts (including patient derived xenografts, PDXs, and circulating tumor cell derived xenografts,
CDXs) on ASCL1 and NEUROD1 through genetic knockdown, and systematically test the ability of blocking
genetically and pharmacologically downstream potentially “druggable” targets of these two transcription factors
to kill SCLCs. We have three specific aims: Aim 1. Determine ASCL1 and NEUROD1 expression patterns
and clinical and molecular correlates in preclinical SCLC models and tumor specimens; Aim 2. Determine
ASCL1 and NEUROD1 genetic dependency phenotypes, potential molecular biomarkers predicting response,
and frequency and mechanisms of resistance in SCLC preclinical models; Aim 3. Determine the role of ASCL1
and NEUROD1 directly regulated “downstream” targets as vulnerabilities that can be exploited for therapeutic
effect using in vivo xenograft shRNA mini-library “drop out” screens and selected drugs that inhibit downstream
“druggable” targets. As part of these aims we will also determine if resistance to ASCL1 or NEUROD1 targeted
therapy in SCLCs develops using CRISPR-CAS9 technology including potential mechanisms of this
resistance, and we will explore the possible use of ASCL1 and NEUROD1 expression as SCLC enrollment
biomarkers for developing “precision medicine” to predict the response of such targeted therapy in individual
SCLCs. We have developed a large amount of preliminary data on which this application is based including 1)
assembling the world’s largest collection of clinically and molecularly annotated human SCLC lines and
xenografts, as well as important GEMMs of SCLC, 2) generating a comprehensive list of directly regulated
downstream targets of ASCL1 and NEUROD1 through ChipSeq/RNASeq and chromatin landscape studies,
and 3) developing experimental approaches to systematically study the dependency of SCLCs on ASCL1 and
NEUORD1 downstream targets. We have assembled a world class team of investigators, including a patient
advocate, with complementary skills to assure the successful completion of this project. The final deliverables
will serve as the basis for new ASCL1 and NEUROD1 targeted therapeutics for SCLC."	3-Dimensional;ASCL1 gene;Ablation;Advocate;BETA2 protein;Behavior;Biological Assay;Biological Markers;CRISPR/Cas technology;Cancer Model;Cancer Patient;Cancer cell line;Cell Line;Cells;ChIP-seq;Chromatin;Clinical;Collection;Congresses;Data;Data Set;Databases;Dependence;Drops;Drug usage;Enrollment;Family member;Frequencies;Future;Genes;Genetic;Genetically Engineered Mouse;Growth;Health;Human;In Vitro;Individual;Induction of Apoptosis;Knock-out;Knowledge;Libraries;Malignant - descriptor;Malignant Neoplasms;Methodology;Methods;Modeling;Molecular;Molecular and Cellular Biology;Mus;Mutate;NFIB gene;Neoplasm Circulating Cells;Neurosecretory Systems;Oncogenes;Pathogenesis;Patients;Pattern;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacology;Phenotype;Pre-Clinical Model;Prevention approach;Prevention therapy;Proteins;Publishing;Regulator Genes;Research Personnel;Resistance;Role;Specimen;Technology;Testing;Therapeutic;Therapeutic Effect;Translations;Work;Xenograft Model;Xenograft procedure;base;behavior in vitro;cancer survival;cancer therapy;cell killing;clinical translation;clinically translatable;druggable target;in vitro Assay;in vivo;knock-down;lung small cell carcinoma;mRNA Expression;molecular marker;neoplastic cell;new therapeutic target;novel therapeutics;patient derived xenograft model;pre-clinical;precision medicine;predicting response;predictive marker;protein expression;resistance frequency;resistance mechanism;response;skills;small hairpin RNA;success;targeted treatment;therapeutic development;therapy development;transcription factor;transcriptome sequencing;tumor	UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER	DALLAS	TX	UNITED STATES	John D.

5U01CA213273-05	U01CA213273	10226133	2021	Novel therapeutic approaches for enhancing anti-tumor immunity in SCLC	"PROJECT SUMMARY
Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a highly lethal malignancy for which new therapeutic strategies are
desperately needed. One promising avenue is the use of immunotherapy (IMT) agents such as PD-1/PD-L1
pathway inhibitors. Despite its high mutation burden, however, data from our group and others indicate that
SCLC paradoxically has an immunosuppressed phenotype with relatively low levels of infiltrating T-cells,
reduced antigen presentation, and increased levels of CD47, a suppressor of myeloid function. Furthermore,
initial clinical testing suggests that most SCLC tumors often express low or very low levels of PD-L1 and fail to
respond to PD-1 inhibitor monotherapy; IMT resistance also inevitably emerges in responding tumors by
mechanisms that have not yet been characterized. Thus, immunosuppressive mechanisms other than the PD-
1/PD-L1 pathway are likely to play a major role in SCLC, and novel therapeutic approaches and combination
therapies are needed to realize the potential of IMT in SCLC.
The goal of this proposal is to address this issue by identifying new IMT targets and novel combination
regimens, and to rapidly translate them into the clinic. Our team already has promising leads. First, we
identified that SCLC is highly vulnerable to drugs targeting DNA damage repair (DDR) including PARP and
Chk1 inhibitors, a finding now supported by early clinical results. Our preliminary data further suggest that DDR
inhibition may increase PD-L1 expression and, by increasing the production of tumor-associated neoantigens
(TAA), may sensitize tumors to IMT. In Aim 1, we will test whether DDR inhibitors can increase the expression
of TAAs, and enhance the efficacy of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. Second, we have developed a novel strategy for
protecting immune cells from the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapy by using inhibitors of CDK4/6, which can
be used to protect immune cells, but not RB-deficient SCLC cells. In Aim 2, we will test whether CDK4/6
inhibition can enhance the anti-tumor effects of immune cells by protecting them from chemotherapy-induced
cytotoxicity and enable improved chemotherapy/IMT combinations in SCLC. Third, we have identified the
“don't-eat-me” signal CD47 as a novel IMT target for SCLC; blockade of CD47 effectively promotes the
phagocytosis of SCLC cells by macrophages and inhibits tumor growth. In Aim 3, we will test whether targeting
this CD47 myeloid checkpoint can enhance antitumor immunity and the efficacy of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade and
chemotherapy in vivo in SCLC models.
The overall hypothesis tested here is that antitumor immunity can be enhanced in SCLC by targeting all these
processes, leading to more effective IMT combination regimens. These studies will be facilitated by novel
immune-competent pre-clinical murine SCLC models that we have developed and by a multidisciplinary team
including clinical and laboratory investigators, immunologists, pathologists, and others with a record of
innovation in SCLC and IMT and a track record of translating laboratory findings into the clinic."

Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is characterized by aggressive growth, genomic heterogeneity, and rapid
development of resistance to chemotherapy. SCLC patients frequently demonstrate initial clinical response to
chemotherapy, including the clinical standard of care cisplatin-etoposide regimen, but eventually succumb to
chemo-refractory disease. Recent sequencing studies have demonstrated that SCLC is one of the most highly
mutated cancers, but these efforts have yet to identify targetable `driver' mutations in both chemo-sensitive and
chemo-refractory disease. Using an unbiased, high-throughput cellular screen of a diverse chemical library, we
have identified that SCLC chemo-sensitive and chemo-refractory tumor cells are highly sensitive to inhibitors of
the general transcription apparatus. In particular, we observed that SCLC tumor cells were highly sensitive to
THZ1, a newly identified covalent inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) that functions as a co-factor for
RNA polymerase II (Pol II). We found that this transcriptional vulnerability is conferred, in part, by the exquisite
sensitivity of key super-enhancer (SE) -driven SCLC oncogenes to transcriptional inhibition. We therefore
hypothesize that the inhibition of other transcriptional CDKs found at SEs and their associated genes could
provide additional therapeutic avenues. For this purpose we have developed structure-inspired approaches for
the design of covalent inhibitors targeting various transcriptional CDKs. We further hypothesize that
comparative analysis of enhancer landscapes and gene expression profiles from chemo-naïve and chemo-
refractory primary tumors will 1) identify transcriptional and epigenetic features specific to chemo-refractory
disease, 2) enable grouping into clinically relevant subtypes, and 3) identify transcriptional and epigenetic
dependencies specific to chemo-refractory disease that can be `drugged' using transcriptional CDK inhibitors.
As changes to tumor oncogene expression and chemo-resistance have been shown to impact the immune
compartment, we anticipate that chemo-refractory tumors will also exhibit changes in immune cell activation
and infiltration. By extending our classification of clinical subtypes to the tumor microenvironment, we hope to
find both tumor and immune cell gene expression programs that amenable to small molecule targeting with the
goal of enhancing tumor immune surveillance capabilities. Lastly, as many transcription CDKs are known to
transcriptionally regulate key pathways that modulate the response to DNA-damaging agents and
immunotherapies we will investigate whether transcriptional CDK inhibitors may also be combined with other
investigational SCLC therapies."

Limited stage small cell lung cancer (LS SCLC), the only curable form of SCLC, is remarkably sensitive to
etoposide plus cisplatin combined with thoracic radiotherapy with response rates > 70%; however, therapy-
refractory recurrence is common. LS SCLC has less than a 25% 5-year overall survival (OS) and ultimately a
strategy for improving long-term SCLC outcomes needs to successfully target tumor cell populations that
survive standard therapy and give rise to recurrent disease. There is, however, a considerable gap in
understanding the specific mechanisms responsible for chemoradiotherapy resistance in SCLC. Our project is
unique among the current portfolio of SCLC funded programs in that we have focused on
chemoradioresistance to increase cure rates in LS SCLC. Recently, our work has suggested using patient-
derived xenograft (PDX) models of SCLC may be an important tool to elucidate mechanisms of therapy
resistance. This approach was remarkably successful, identifying a tolerable and strongly synergistic anti-
SCLC interaction that led to a CTEP-approved trial based on our preclinical data - (NCI #10070; Study Chair:
Hann). In this research program, we will test key hypotheses via three specific aims that will provide more
mechanistic insights into the rapidly emergent chemoradiation resistance observed in LS SCLC.
One central hypothesis of this proposal is that adaptive gene expression changes mediate rapid emergence of
the chemoradiation resistance phenotype in LS SCLC. We have developed a novel chemoradiation treatment
regimen with SCLC PDX models to facilitate these studies. Development and characterization of this novel
model involves a unique collaboration between medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, bioinformaticians,
medical physicists, veterinarians and molecular/cell biologists that is extremely well suited to develop an
integrated program dedicated to resolving questions of SCLC chemoradioresistance. Finally, we have already
identified novel gene targets that are correlated with SCLC chemoradioresistance.
Our research program is organized as follows: Aim #1: Characterize natural history of response of
experimental models of SCLC to chemoradiation in vivo. We will determine response rates and recurrence
patterns of a panel of SCLC PDXs and transgenic mouse models. Aim #2: Characterization of molecular
underpinnings of SCLC chemoradiation resistance. We will reconstruct gene regulatory networks and gene
expression profiles associated with chemoradiation resistance and develop small-scale predictive classifiers for
therapy response to be validated in follow-up studies. Aim #3: Pharmacologic and genetic validation of
candidate genes for SCLC chemoradiation resistance in vitro and in vivo. We will validate our novel gene
candidates for conferring chemoradiation resistance using pharmacologic and genetic approach with SCLC
PDX-derived organoids and SCLC transgenic mouse models."

5U01CA235625-03	U01CA235625	10092980	2021	Employing CRISPR inactivation screening and in vivo models towards improving treatments for SCLC	"SUMMARY
With a lack of druggable oncogenic mutations in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and no approved targeted
therapies, we need to identify new treatment approaches for SCLC. In this proposal, we apply whole genome
CRISPR inactivation screens to identify genes that are essential for SCLC broadly, or for key genetically defined
subsets. We then determine whether pharmacologic inhibition of identified hits also results in selective killing of
SCLC cells. We apply in vivo systems including patient derived xenograft (PDX) and genetically engineered
mouse models to test pharmacologic inhibitors of key targets identified in these genetic screens. Aim 1 will focus
on a pathway that we already identified using CRISPR inactivation screens to be essential for Rb/p53-mutant
SCLC cells. Components of a NEDD8/RBX1 pathway, controlling Cullin activity and protein ubiquitylation, were
essential for SCLC cells. Pharmacologic inhibition of NEDD8 activating enzyme (NAE) using MLN4924 in patient
derived xenograft (PDX) models confirmed reliance of SCLC cells on this pathway. Excitingly, we identified
examples of exceptional responses to MLN4924 in some PDX models. Aim 1: Apply in vivo models to direct
NEDD8 inhibition to subsets of SCLC most likely to respond. Here, we explore the potential for inhibiting
the NEDD8 pathway in SCLC. We will combine NAE inhibition with cisplatin-etoposide chemotherapy and
determine whether durable responses result. Some SCLC PDX models exhibited exquisite sensitivity to NAE
inhibition; we will identify underlying mechanisms and genetic features of super-responding PDX models that
could be used to help predict exceptional responders. We will determine whether NAE inhibition should be
directed to all SCLC patients, or to key subsets, and whether this approach augments response to chemotherapy.
MLN4924 is already being tested in clinical trials for other cancer types and this work could rapidly lead to clinical
trials in SCLC. Aim 2: Apply CRISPR inactivation screens to identify new therapeutic targets for SCLC.
This Aim will extend our CRISPR inactivation screens to include mouse SCLC cell lines with key driver mutations
beyond Rb/p53, including Pten, Crebbp and Mycl. Our approach takes advantage of the fact that while human
SCLC has an extremely high mutational burden, leading to extensive heterogeneity among SCLC with a given
driver mutation, mouse SCLC with defined driver alterations are more homogenous, increasing signal to noise
in identifying vulnerabilities. We will identify dependencies in genetically-defined subsets of SCLC and will test
inhibitors of identified druggable targets in PDX and GEM models that harbor defined genetic alterations. We
leverage available mouse models and derived cell lines, along with a bank of genetically annotated PDX models,
studied in vivo and ex vivo, to identify and evaluate completely new ways to target key genetic subsets of SCLC."

5U01CA220323-04	U01CA220323	10247067	2021	Using patient-derived models to understand drug responses in SCLC	"PROJECT SUMMARY
Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) afflicts more than 30,000 patients per year and is rapidly fatal in 95% of cases,
with median survival is less than one year. Belying this grim prognosis, treatment-naive SCLC is highly
sensitive to chemotherapy, with response rates in excess of 70% for etoposide/platinum. However, relapse is
nearly inevitable, and relapsed SCLC presents two obstacles that have been insurmountable for at least 30
years: cross-resistance to chemotherapy, and absence of biomarker-driven targeted therapy.
Following relapse, resistance often extends beyond etoposide/platinum, and a disease that was once highly
chemosensitive becomes inexorably progressive. However, the molecular determinants of cross-resistance in
SCLC remain unclear. Although critically important, cross-resistance is difficult to study experimentally, as it
requires a model system that faithfully reproduces clinical outcomes.
Topotecan is the only approved second-line therapy, but NCCN guidelines list 10 agents of nearly equivalent
efficacy. None are particularly effective in unselected patients, and although there is significant molecular
heterogeneity in SCLC, this does not guide patient selection. As novel targets and therapeutic regimens
emerge, biomarker discovery will require a model system that recapitulates the molecular features of patient
tumors, so that molecular heterogeneity can be parsed into clinically meaningful subgroups.
We have generated a panel of 44 SCLC patient-derived xenograft models (PDXs) from biopsy specimens and
circulating tumor cells (CTCs). Our panel includes successive models from individual patients at time points
before and after specific lines of therapy, with detailed information about the corresponding clinical response.
For both standard chemotherapy and experimental agents in clinical trial, these models faithfully mirror patient
responses. However, unlike the patient experience, multiple strategies can be compared for identical tumors.
We propose to use these models to directly compare standard first and second-line chemotherapy with two
experimental regimens that have given promising results in the clinic or in preclinical assays: olaparib plus
temozolomide, in a phase I/II trial at MGH, and a combined Mcl-1/Bcl-2 inhibitors. Individually, these PDX
population trials are designed to reveal biomarkers of sensitivity and mechanisms of resistance for promising
experimental therapies. Collectively, they present a novel opportunity to model cross-resistance through
comparative analysis with reference to the clinical histories of each model.
The successful completion of this work will establish a large collection of PDX models with comprehensive
molecular an functional profiles. In addition, these experiments will investigate the molecular determinants of
cross-resistance following chemotherapy, a problem that has beleaguered management of SCLC for over
three decades."

5U01CA242919-02	U01CA242919	9980811	2020	Exploiting POU2F3 addiction in the tuft cell variant of small cell lung cancer	"Project Summary
Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is the most aggressive form of lung cancer, which is associated with a high mitotic
rate, early metastatic spread, and a rapid evolution of chemotherapy resistance. We recently discovered a novel
form of SCLC that resembles the tuft cell lineage, which can be distinguished from the classical neuroendocrine
form of this disease through immunohistochemical staining of POU2F3. Importantly, we have identified several
molecular vulnerabilities that are specific to the variant form of this disease. In this research proposal, we seek
to advance personalized therapies that exploit the unique lineage program present in the tuft cell variant of SCLC.
Our innovative functional genomics strategy has already uncovered actionable dependencies that are unique to
tuft cell variant of SCLC, such as the kinase IGF1R. In addition, we discovered a profound addiction of tuft cell
variant SCLC tumors to POU2F3. Here we will investigate the molecular basis of POU2F3 addiction in SCLC,
with the explicit intent to develop small molecules that interfere with POU2F3 function. The first Aim of this
proposal will build upon the extensive epigenomic analyses we have performed in SCLC, which has defined a
unique enhancer landscape sustained by POU2F3 in this disease. We will now employ two independent
functional approaches to elucidate the critical POU2F3 binding sites/enhancers in the genome of SCLC cells,
which will be leveraged to pinpoint the critical components of the tuft cell lineage circuit that might be targeted
therapeutically. The second Aim will evaluate POU2F3 cofactors, which we have already nominated via an
innovative ChIP-SICAP-mass spectrometry analysis of endogenous POU2F3 binding sites. We will perform
CRISPR exon scanning and biochemical analysis of each cofactor to define the critical POU2F3:cofactor
interactions that selectively support this malignancy. The final Aim of this proposal will employ functional
genomics to devise drug combinations with the IGF1R inhibitor linsitinib that are rational and exploit synthetic-
lethal genetic interactions. We will also employ our latest CRISPR innovation, homolog co-targeting CRISPR
screens, to expose redundant kinase vulnerabilities that are linked with neuroendocrine versus tuft cell variants
of SCLC. In summary, we estimate that the tuft cell-like variant is present in ~18% of SCLC cases, which
corresponds to approximately 5,000 newly diagnosed SCLC cases and approximately 3,500 deaths in the United
States alone each year. Hence, the proposed research could lead to a sustained impact that affects a large
patient population for which novel medicines are desperately needed."

5U01CA213273-04	U01CA213273	9974992	2020	Novel therapeutic approaches for enhancing anti-tumor immunity in SCLC	"PROJECT SUMMARY
Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a highly lethal malignancy for which new therapeutic strategies are
desperately needed. One promising avenue is the use of immunotherapy (IMT) agents such as PD-1/PD-L1
pathway inhibitors. Despite its high mutation burden, however, data from our group and others indicate that
SCLC paradoxically has an immunosuppressed phenotype with relatively low levels of infiltrating T-cells,
reduced antigen presentation, and increased levels of CD47, a suppressor of myeloid function. Furthermore,
initial clinical testing suggests that most SCLC tumors often express low or very low levels of PD-L1 and fail to
respond to PD-1 inhibitor monotherapy; IMT resistance also inevitably emerges in responding tumors by
mechanisms that have not yet been characterized. Thus, immunosuppressive mechanisms other than the PD-
1/PD-L1 pathway are likely to play a major role in SCLC, and novel therapeutic approaches and combination
therapies are needed to realize the potential of IMT in SCLC.
The goal of this proposal is to address this issue by identifying new IMT targets and novel combination
regimens, and to rapidly translate them into the clinic. Our team already has promising leads. First, we
identified that SCLC is highly vulnerable to drugs targeting DNA damage repair (DDR) including PARP and
Chk1 inhibitors, a finding now supported by early clinical results. Our preliminary data further suggest that DDR
inhibition may increase PD-L1 expression and, by increasing the production of tumor-associated neoantigens
(TAA), may sensitize tumors to IMT. In Aim 1, we will test whether DDR inhibitors can increase the expression
of TAAs, and enhance the efficacy of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. Second, we have developed a novel strategy for
protecting immune cells from the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapy by using inhibitors of CDK4/6, which can
be used to protect immune cells, but not RB-deficient SCLC cells. In Aim 2, we will test whether CDK4/6
inhibition can enhance the anti-tumor effects of immune cells by protecting them from chemotherapy-induced
cytotoxicity and enable improved chemotherapy/IMT combinations in SCLC. Third, we have identified the
“don't-eat-me” signal CD47 as a novel IMT target for SCLC; blockade of CD47 effectively promotes the
phagocytosis of SCLC cells by macrophages and inhibits tumor growth. In Aim 3, we will test whether targeting
this CD47 myeloid checkpoint can enhance antitumor immunity and the efficacy of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade and
chemotherapy in vivo in SCLC models.
The overall hypothesis tested here is that antitumor immunity can be enhanced in SCLC by targeting all these
processes, leading to more effective IMT combination regimens. These studies will be facilitated by novel
immune-competent pre-clinical murine SCLC models that we have developed and by a multidisciplinary team
including clinical and laboratory investigators, immunologists, pathologists, and others with a record of
innovation in SCLC and IMT and a track record of translating laboratory findings into the clinic."

Limited stage small cell lung cancer (LS SCLC), the only curable form of SCLC, is remarkably sensitive to
etoposide plus cisplatin combined with thoracic radiotherapy with response rates > 70%; however, therapy-
refractory recurrence is common. LS SCLC has less than a 25% 5-year overall survival (OS) and ultimately a
strategy for improving long-term SCLC outcomes needs to successfully target tumor cell populations that
survive standard therapy and give rise to recurrent disease. There is, however, a considerable gap in
understanding the specific mechanisms responsible for chemoradiotherapy resistance in SCLC. Our project is
unique among the current portfolio of SCLC funded programs in that we have focused on
chemoradioresistance to increase cure rates in LS SCLC. Recently, our work has suggested using patient-
derived xenograft (PDX) models of SCLC may be an important tool to elucidate mechanisms of therapy
resistance. This approach was remarkably successful, identifying a tolerable and strongly synergistic anti-
SCLC interaction that led to a CTEP-approved trial based on our preclinical data - (NCI #10070; Study Chair:
Hann). In this research program, we will test key hypotheses via three specific aims that will provide more
mechanistic insights into the rapidly emergent chemoradiation resistance observed in LS SCLC.
One central hypothesis of this proposal is that adaptive gene expression changes mediate rapid emergence of
the chemoradiation resistance phenotype in LS SCLC. We have developed a novel chemoradiation treatment
regimen with SCLC PDX models to facilitate these studies. Development and characterization of this novel
model involves a unique collaboration between medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, bioinformaticians,
medical physicists, veterinarians and molecular/cell biologists that is extremely well suited to develop an
integrated program dedicated to resolving questions of SCLC chemoradioresistance. Finally, we have already
identified novel gene targets that are correlated with SCLC chemoradioresistance.
Our research program is organized as follows: Aim #1: Characterize natural history of response of
experimental models of SCLC to chemoradiation in vivo. We will determine response rates and recurrence
patterns of a panel of SCLC PDXs and transgenic mouse models. Aim #2: Characterization of molecular
underpinnings of SCLC chemoradiation resistance. We will reconstruct gene regulatory networks and gene
expression profiles associated with chemoradiation resistance and develop small-scale predictive classifiers for
therapy response to be validated in follow-up studies. Aim #3: Pharmacologic and genetic validation of
candidate genes for SCLC chemoradiation resistance in vitro and in vivo. We will validate our novel gene
candidates for conferring chemoradiation resistance using pharmacologic and genetic approach with SCLC
PDX-derived organoids and SCLC transgenic mouse models."

5U01CA213333-04	U01CA213333	9937691	2020	Targeting the transcriptional and epigenetic landscape in chemo-refractory Small-Cell Lung Cancer	"Summary
Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is characterized by aggressive growth, genomic heterogeneity, and rapid
development of resistance to chemotherapy. SCLC patients frequently demonstrate initial clinical response to
chemotherapy, including the clinical standard of care cisplatin-etoposide regimen, but eventually succumb to
chemo-refractory disease. Recent sequencing studies have demonstrated that SCLC is one of the most highly
mutated cancers, but these efforts have yet to identify targetable `driver' mutations in both chemo-sensitive and
chemo-refractory disease. Using an unbiased, high-throughput cellular screen of a diverse chemical library, we
have identified that SCLC chemo-sensitive and chemo-refractory tumor cells are highly sensitive to inhibitors of
the general transcription apparatus. In particular, we observed that SCLC tumor cells were highly sensitive to
THZ1, a newly identified covalent inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) that functions as a co-factor for
RNA polymerase II (Pol II). We found that this transcriptional vulnerability is conferred, in part, by the exquisite
sensitivity of key super-enhancer (SE) -driven SCLC oncogenes to transcriptional inhibition. We therefore
hypothesize that the inhibition of other transcriptional CDKs found at SEs and their associated genes could
provide additional therapeutic avenues. For this purpose we have developed structure-inspired approaches for
the design of covalent inhibitors targeting various transcriptional CDKs. We further hypothesize that
comparative analysis of enhancer landscapes and gene expression profiles from chemo-naïve and chemo-
refractory primary tumors will 1) identify transcriptional and epigenetic features specific to chemo-refractory
disease, 2) enable grouping into clinically relevant subtypes, and 3) identify transcriptional and epigenetic
dependencies specific to chemo-refractory disease that can be `drugged' using transcriptional CDK inhibitors.
As changes to tumor oncogene expression and chemo-resistance have been shown to impact the immune
compartment, we anticipate that chemo-refractory tumors will also exhibit changes in immune cell activation
and infiltration. By extending our classification of clinical subtypes to the tumor microenvironment, we hope to
find both tumor and immune cell gene expression programs that amenable to small molecule targeting with the
goal of enhancing tumor immune surveillance capabilities. Lastly, as many transcription CDKs are known to
transcriptionally regulate key pathways that modulate the response to DNA-damaging agents and
immunotherapies we will investigate whether transcriptional CDK inhibitors may also be combined with other
investigational SCLC therapies."

Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is responsible for over 30,000 deaths each year in the United States alone.
SCLC has a two-year survival rate of ~6% and unlike the other major subtypes of lung cancer, there are
currently no targeted therapies approved for SCLC. SCLC is initially highly responsive to chemotherapy, but
rapidly develops resistance leading to mortality in ~10 months. Clearly, a major unmet need for the treatment
of SCLC is the identification of new therapeutic targets and treatment strategies to combat chemo-resistant
disease. Our understanding of chemotherapy resistance mechanisms has been hampered by a lack of
relapsed human SCLC tissue due to rare surgical resections. In addition, there have been few mouse models
of the disease that exhibit short latencies and chemo-sensitivity. To address these challenges, we performed
whole exome sequencing on relapsed SCLC from 30 patients. Relapse-specific genomic alterations in the
WNT/APC/β-catenin pathway were identified in ~66% of relapsed SCLC suggesting that this pathway
promotes chemo-resistance. Second, we developed a novel mouse model of SCLC driven by loss of Rb1,
Trp53 and overexpression of Myc—three of the most common genetic alterations in the human disease. Mice
develop SCLC within weeks that highly resembles the human disease at the level of histopathology, biomarker
expression and chemo-sensitivity followed by relapse. This model will be a useful tool to test candidate
chemotherapy resistance mechanisms and identify novel therapeutic targets that inhibit chemo-resistance. The
objective of this study is to use this novel mouse model and comprehensive genomic analyses of primary and
relapsed human SCLC to identify mechanisms of chemotherapy resistance and novel therapeutic targets to
combat chemo-resistant disease. We hypothesize that activation of the WNT/β-catenin pathway promotes
chemo-resistance in SCLC and that targeted inhibition of the pathway will inhibit chemo-resistant disease. We
predict that expansion of our genomic and transcriptomic profiling will identify additional novel pathways
involved in chemo-resistance. To test these hypotheses, we will: 1) identify recurrent pathway alterations in
relapsed human and mouse SCLC using whole genome, exome, transcriptome and epigenome sequencing
and 2) functionally determine whether canonical WNT/β-catenin signaling and other candidate pathways are
necessary and sufficient for chemo-resistance in SCLC in vivo. This approach is innovative because we will
employ unbiased comprehensive genomic and epigenomic analyses on relapsed human SCLC and a novel
immune-competent mouse model of SCLC that recapitulates key features of the human disease. The WNT/β-
catenin pathway is largely unexplored in SCLC. This research is significant because there are currently no
targeted therapies approved for SCLC. A better understanding of the critical pathways driving chemo-
resistance in SCLC will impact the treatment and survival of patients with this intractable disease."

This application focuses on developing new targeted therapy for SCLC focusing on two key lineage oncogenes
involved in SCLC pathogenesis and malignant behavior, ASCL1 and NEUROD1. Nearly 90% of SCLCs
express ASCL1, NEUROD1 or both. In the preclinical models, including human SCLC lines and xenografts and
genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) of SCLC, tumors that express either ASCL1 or NEUROD1
appear “addicted” to their expression and function. The presence of ASCL1 or NEUROD1 also are associated
with expression of important downstream oncogenes and regulatory genes. If ASCL1/NEUROD1 are removed
(through genetic knockdown) SCLCs undergo many logs of tumor cell kill. Using state of the art technology in
human preclinical models, we propose to systematically study the dependency of a large number of SCLC
lines and xenografts (including patient derived xenografts, PDXs, and circulating tumor cell derived xenografts,
CDXs) on ASCL1 and NEUROD1 through genetic knockdown, and systematically test the ability of blocking
genetically and pharmacologically downstream potentially “druggable” targets of these two transcription factors
to kill SCLCs. We have three specific aims: Aim 1. Determine ASCL1 and NEUROD1 expression patterns
and clinical and molecular correlates in preclinical SCLC models and tumor specimens; Aim 2. Determine
ASCL1 and NEUROD1 genetic dependency phenotypes, potential molecular biomarkers predicting response,
and frequency and mechanisms of resistance in SCLC preclinical models; Aim 3. Determine the role of ASCL1
and NEUROD1 directly regulated “downstream” targets as vulnerabilities that can be exploited for therapeutic
effect using in vivo xenograft shRNA mini-library “drop out” screens and selected drugs that inhibit downstream
“druggable” targets. As part of these aims we will also determine if resistance to ASCL1 or NEUROD1 targeted
therapy in SCLCs develops using CRISPR-CAS9 technology including potential mechanisms of this
resistance, and we will explore the possible use of ASCL1 and NEUROD1 expression as SCLC enrollment
biomarkers for developing “precision medicine” to predict the response of such targeted therapy in individual
SCLCs. We have developed a large amount of preliminary data on which this application is based including 1)
assembling the world’s largest collection of clinically and molecularly annotated human SCLC lines and
xenografts, as well as important GEMMs of SCLC, 2) generating a comprehensive list of directly regulated
downstream targets of ASCL1 and NEUROD1 through ChipSeq/RNASeq and chromatin landscape studies,
and 3) developing experimental approaches to systematically study the dependency of SCLCs on ASCL1 and
NEUORD1 downstream targets. We have assembled a world class team of investigators, including a patient
advocate, with complementary skills to assure the successful completion of this project. The final deliverables
will serve as the basis for new ASCL1 and NEUROD1 targeted therapeutics for SCLC."	3-Dimensional;ASCL1 gene;Ablation;Advocate;BETA2 protein;Behavior;Biological Assay;Biological Markers;CRISPR/Cas technology;Cancer Model;Cancer Patient;Cancer cell line;Cell Line;Cells;ChIP-seq;Chromatin;Clinical;Collection;Congresses;Data;Data Set;Databases;Dependence;Drops;Drug usage;Enrollment;Family member;Frequencies;Future;Genes;Genetic;Genetically Engineered Mouse;Growth;Health;Human;In Vitro;Individual;Induction of Apoptosis;Knock-out;Knowledge;Libraries;Malignant - descriptor;Malignant Neoplasms;Methodology;Methods;Modeling;Molecular;Molecular and Cellular Biology;Mus;Mutate;NFIB gene;Neoplasm Circulating Cells;Neurosecretory Systems;Oncogenes;Pathogenesis;Patients;Pattern;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacology;Phenotype;Pre-Clinical Model;Prevention approach;Prevention therapy;Proteins;Publishing;Regulator Genes;Research Personnel;Resistance;Role;Specimen;Technology;Testing;Therapeutic;Therapeutic Effect;Translations;Work;Xenograft Model;Xenograft procedure;base;behavior in vitro;cancer survival;cancer therapy;cell killing;clinical translation;clinically translatable;druggable target;in vitro Assay;in vivo;knock-down;lung small cell carcinoma;mRNA Expression;molecular marker;neoplastic cell;new therapeutic target;novel therapeutics;pre-clinical;precision medicine;predicting response;predictive marker;protein expression;resistance frequency;resistance mechanism;response;skills;small hairpin RNA;success;targeted treatment;therapeutic development;therapy development;transcription factor;transcriptome sequencing;tumor	UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER	DALLAS	TX	UNITED STATES	John D.

5U01CA213359-03	U01CA213359	9617228	2019	Preclinical development of a DLL3-targeted theranostic for small cell lung cancer	"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is remarkable for exceptionally high metastatic potential, initial robust
response to DNA damaging agents, and near universal development of resistance. This combination of
predilection for early metastasis acquired treatment resistance – often times manifested as cross resistance to
multiple agents – highlights a critical need for novel systemic therapies operating through a novel mechanism
in order to achieve improved patient outcomes.
 Delta-like ligand 3 (DLL3), has recently been identified as a therapeutic target in SCLC. The highly
tumor-selective surface expression of this protein make it an excellent candidate target for an antibody drug
conjugate (ADC). Rovalpituzumab tesserine (Rova-T) is one such ADC that is showing encouraging efficacy
signals in the clinic. However, despite apparent clinical benefit, this agent has also been associated with some
severe adverse events attributable to the presence of the anthracycline PBD warhead. DLL3 targeting
approaches are in need of both a real-time, quantitative diagnostic biomarker and a therapeutic approach with
reduced toxicity.
 We propose a theranostic approach comprising on 89Zr immunoPET and a 90Y/177Lu
radioimmunotherapeutic. The first Aim improves upon already promising bioconjugation chemistry. We are
already able to obtain high-contrast immunoPET images using non-specific amine labeling and site-specific
maleimide bioconjugation. We will improve upon this approach by developing more stable thiol-clickable
methylsuflone chelators for 89Zr and 90Y/177Lu to minimize kidney dose. The second Aim identifies preclinical
dosing parameters and comprehensively optimizes efficacy and toxicity in a traditional cell line xenograft. Our
preliminary imaging data is focused on H82, an SCLC cell lined derived from a chemoexperienced patient. This
cell line is very resistant to etoposide in vitro and in vivo and will be used to identify a radiotherapy dose that
demonstrates efficacy in vivo, while minimizing dose to the kidney. Different dose ranges and schedules will be
explored. The final Aim explores radiotherapy in a variety of in vivo contexts including lesion sizes ranging from
0.1 to 10 mm in diameter and representing both chemonaïve and chemoresistant disease. Radioisotopes have
different energy deposition depending on the volume of the tumor being targeted. We will evaluate 90Y and
177Lu radioisotopes in different in vivo models of small cell lung cancer for the ability to eradicate lesions of
different sizes. A unique resource in the lab is our collection of 10 paired chemonaïve and chemoresistant
patient-derived xenograft lines. We will place particular emphasis on establishing efficacy in the context of

5U01CA213333-03	U01CA213333	9709254	2019	Targeting the transcriptional and epigenetic landscape in chemo-refractory Small-Cell Lung Cancer	"Summary
Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is characterized by aggressive growth, genomic heterogeneity, and rapid
development of resistance to chemotherapy. SCLC patients frequently demonstrate initial clinical response to
chemotherapy, including the clinical standard of care cisplatin-etoposide regimen, but eventually succumb to
chemo-refractory disease. Recent sequencing studies have demonstrated that SCLC is one of the most highly
mutated cancers, but these efforts have yet to identify targetable `driver' mutations in both chemo-sensitive and
chemo-refractory disease. Using an unbiased, high-throughput cellular screen of a diverse chemical library, we
have identified that SCLC chemo-sensitive and chemo-refractory tumor cells are highly sensitive to inhibitors of
the general transcription apparatus. In particular, we observed that SCLC tumor cells were highly sensitive to
THZ1, a newly identified covalent inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) that functions as a co-factor for
RNA polymerase II (Pol II). We found that this transcriptional vulnerability is conferred, in part, by the exquisite
sensitivity of key super-enhancer (SE) -driven SCLC oncogenes to transcriptional inhibition. We therefore
hypothesize that the inhibition of other transcriptional CDKs found at SEs and their associated genes could
provide additional therapeutic avenues. For this purpose we have developed structure-inspired approaches for
the design of covalent inhibitors targeting various transcriptional CDKs. We further hypothesize that
comparative analysis of enhancer landscapes and gene expression profiles from chemo-naïve and chemo-
refractory primary tumors will 1) identify transcriptional and epigenetic features specific to chemo-refractory
disease, 2) enable grouping into clinically relevant subtypes, and 3) identify transcriptional and epigenetic
dependencies specific to chemo-refractory disease that can be `drugged' using transcriptional CDK inhibitors.
As changes to tumor oncogene expression and chemo-resistance have been shown to impact the immune
compartment, we anticipate that chemo-refractory tumors will also exhibit changes in immune cell activation
and infiltration. By extending our classification of clinical subtypes to the tumor microenvironment, we hope to
find both tumor and immune cell gene expression programs that amenable to small molecule targeting with the
goal of enhancing tumor immune surveillance capabilities. Lastly, as many transcription CDKs are known to
transcriptionally regulate key pathways that modulate the response to DNA-damaging agents and
immunotherapies we will investigate whether transcriptional CDK inhibitors may also be combined with other
investigational SCLC therapies."

5U01CA231844-02	U01CA231844	9772410	2019	Genomic and Functional Identification of Chemotherapy Resistance Mechanisms in Small Cell Lung Cancer	"Project Summary
Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is responsible for over 30,000 deaths each year in the United States alone.
SCLC has a two-year survival rate of ~6% and unlike the other major subtypes of lung cancer, there are
currently no targeted therapies approved for SCLC. SCLC is initially highly responsive to chemotherapy, but
rapidly develops resistance leading to mortality in ~10 months. Clearly, a major unmet need for the treatment
of SCLC is the identification of new therapeutic targets and treatment strategies to combat chemo-resistant
disease. Our understanding of chemotherapy resistance mechanisms has been hampered by a lack of
relapsed human SCLC tissue due to rare surgical resections. In addition, there have been few mouse models
of the disease that exhibit short latencies and chemo-sensitivity. To address these challenges, we performed
whole exome sequencing on relapsed SCLC from 30 patients. Relapse-specific genomic alterations in the
WNT/APC/β-catenin pathway were identified in ~66% of relapsed SCLC suggesting that this pathway
promotes chemo-resistance. Second, we developed a novel mouse model of SCLC driven by loss of Rb1,
Trp53 and overexpression of Myc—three of the most common genetic alterations in the human disease. Mice
develop SCLC within weeks that highly resembles the human disease at the level of histopathology, biomarker
expression and chemo-sensitivity followed by relapse. This model will be a useful tool to test candidate
chemotherapy resistance mechanisms and identify novel therapeutic targets that inhibit chemo-resistance. The
objective of this study is to use this novel mouse model and comprehensive genomic analyses of primary and
relapsed human SCLC to identify mechanisms of chemotherapy resistance and novel therapeutic targets to
combat chemo-resistant disease. We hypothesize that activation of the WNT/β-catenin pathway promotes
chemo-resistance in SCLC and that targeted inhibition of the pathway will inhibit chemo-resistant disease. We
predict that expansion of our genomic and transcriptomic profiling will identify additional novel pathways
involved in chemo-resistance. To test these hypotheses, we will: 1) identify recurrent pathway alterations in
relapsed human and mouse SCLC using whole genome, exome, transcriptome and epigenome sequencing
and 2) functionally determine whether canonical WNT/β-catenin signaling and other candidate pathways are
necessary and sufficient for chemo-resistance in SCLC in vivo. This approach is innovative because we will
employ unbiased comprehensive genomic and epigenomic analyses on relapsed human SCLC and a novel
immune-competent mouse model of SCLC that recapitulates key features of the human disease. The WNT/β-
catenin pathway is largely unexplored in SCLC. This research is significant because there are currently no
targeted therapies approved for SCLC. A better understanding of the critical pathways driving chemo-
resistance in SCLC will impact the treatment and survival of patients with this intractable disease."

5U01CA213273-03	U01CA213273	9745547	2019	Novel therapeutic approaches for enhancing anti-tumor immunity in SCLC	"PROJECT SUMMARY
Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a highly lethal malignancy for which new therapeutic strategies are
desperately needed. One promising avenue is the use of immunotherapy (IMT) agents such as PD-1/PD-L1
pathway inhibitors. Despite its high mutation burden, however, data from our group and others indicate that
SCLC paradoxically has an immunosuppressed phenotype with relatively low levels of infiltrating T-cells,
reduced antigen presentation, and increased levels of CD47, a suppressor of myeloid function. Furthermore,
initial clinical testing suggests that most SCLC tumors often express low or very low levels of PD-L1 and fail to
respond to PD-1 inhibitor monotherapy; IMT resistance also inevitably emerges in responding tumors by
mechanisms that have not yet been characterized. Thus, immunosuppressive mechanisms other than the PD-
1/PD-L1 pathway are likely to play a major role in SCLC, and novel therapeutic approaches and combination
therapies are needed to realize the potential of IMT in SCLC.
The goal of this proposal is to address this issue by identifying new IMT targets and novel combination
regimens, and to rapidly translate them into the clinic. Our team already has promising leads. First, we
identified that SCLC is highly vulnerable to drugs targeting DNA damage repair (DDR) including PARP and
Chk1 inhibitors, a finding now supported by early clinical results. Our preliminary data further suggest that DDR
inhibition may increase PD-L1 expression and, by increasing the production of tumor-associated neoantigens
(TAA), may sensitize tumors to IMT. In Aim 1, we will test whether DDR inhibitors can increase the expression
of TAAs, and enhance the efficacy of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. Second, we have developed a novel strategy for
protecting immune cells from the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapy by using inhibitors of CDK4/6, which can
be used to protect immune cells, but not RB-deficient SCLC cells. In Aim 2, we will test whether CDK4/6
inhibition can enhance the anti-tumor effects of immune cells by protecting them from chemotherapy-induced
cytotoxicity and enable improved chemotherapy/IMT combinations in SCLC. Third, we have identified the
“don't-eat-me” signal CD47 as a novel IMT target for SCLC; blockade of CD47 effectively promotes the
phagocytosis of SCLC cells by macrophages and inhibits tumor growth. In Aim 3, we will test whether targeting
this CD47 myeloid checkpoint can enhance antitumor immunity and the efficacy of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade and
chemotherapy in vivo in SCLC models.
The overall hypothesis tested here is that antitumor immunity can be enhanced in SCLC by targeting all these
processes, leading to more effective IMT combination regimens. These studies will be facilitated by novel
immune-competent pre-clinical murine SCLC models that we have developed and by a multidisciplinary team
including clinical and laboratory investigators, immunologists, pathologists, and others with a record of
innovation in SCLC and IMT and a track record of translating laboratory findings into the clinic."

1U01CA242919-01	U01CA242919	9826108	2019	Exploiting POU2F3 addiction in the tuft cell variant of small cell lung cancer	"Project Summary
Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is the most aggressive form of lung cancer, which is associated with a high mitotic
rate, early metastatic spread, and a rapid evolution of chemotherapy resistance. We recently discovered a novel
form of SCLC that resembles the tuft cell lineage, which can be distinguished from the classical neuroendocrine
form of this disease through immunohistochemical staining of POU2F3. Importantly, we have identified several
molecular vulnerabilities that are specific to the variant form of this disease. In this research proposal, we seek
to advance personalized therapies that exploit the unique lineage program present in the tuft cell variant of SCLC.
Our innovative functional genomics strategy has already uncovered actionable dependencies that are unique to
tuft cell variant of SCLC, such as the kinase IGF1R. In addition, we discovered a profound addiction of tuft cell
variant SCLC tumors to POU2F3. Here we will investigate the molecular basis of POU2F3 addiction in SCLC,
with the explicit intent to develop small molecules that interfere with POU2F3 function. The first Aim of this
proposal will build upon the extensive epigenomic analyses we have performed in SCLC, which has defined a
unique enhancer landscape sustained by POU2F3 in this disease. We will now employ two independent
functional approaches to elucidate the critical POU2F3 binding sites/enhancers in the genome of SCLC cells,
which will be leveraged to pinpoint the critical components of the tuft cell lineage circuit that might be targeted
therapeutically. The second Aim will evaluate POU2F3 cofactors, which we have already nominated via an
innovative ChIP-SICAP-mass spectrometry analysis of endogenous POU2F3 binding sites. We will perform
CRISPR exon scanning and biochemical analysis of each cofactor to define the critical POU2F3:cofactor
interactions that selectively support this malignancy. The final Aim of this proposal will employ functional
genomics to devise drug combinations with the IGF1R inhibitor linsitinib that are rational and exploit synthetic-
lethal genetic interactions. We will also employ our latest CRISPR innovation, homolog co-targeting CRISPR
screens, to expose redundant kinase vulnerabilities that are linked with neuroendocrine versus tuft cell variants
of SCLC. In summary, we estimate that the tuft cell-like variant is present in ~18% of SCLC cases, which
corresponds to approximately 5,000 newly diagnosed SCLC cases and approximately 3,500 deaths in the United
States alone each year. Hence, the proposed research could lead to a sustained impact that affects a large
patient population for which novel medicines are desperately needed."

Limited stage small cell lung cancer (LS SCLC), the only curable form of SCLC, is remarkably sensitive to
etoposide plus cisplatin combined with thoracic radiotherapy with response rates > 70%; however, therapy-
refractory recurrence is common. LS SCLC has less than a 25% 5-year overall survival (OS) and ultimately a
strategy for improving long-term SCLC outcomes needs to successfully target tumor cell populations that
survive standard therapy and give rise to recurrent disease. There is, however, a considerable gap in
understanding the specific mechanisms responsible for chemoradiotherapy resistance in SCLC. Our project is
unique among the current portfolio of SCLC funded programs in that we have focused on
chemoradioresistance to increase cure rates in LS SCLC. Recently, our work has suggested using patient-
derived xenograft (PDX) models of SCLC may be an important tool to elucidate mechanisms of therapy
resistance. This approach was remarkably successful, identifying a tolerable and strongly synergistic anti-
SCLC interaction that led to a CTEP-approved trial based on our preclinical data - (NCI #10070; Study Chair:
Hann). In this research program, we will test key hypotheses via three specific aims that will provide more
mechanistic insights into the rapidly emergent chemoradiation resistance observed in LS SCLC.
One central hypothesis of this proposal is that adaptive gene expression changes mediate rapid emergence of
the chemoradiation resistance phenotype in LS SCLC. We have developed a novel chemoradiation treatment
regimen with SCLC PDX models to facilitate these studies. Development and characterization of this novel
model involves a unique collaboration between medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, bioinformaticians,
medical physicists, veterinarians and molecular/cell biologists that is extremely well suited to develop an
integrated program dedicated to resolving questions of SCLC chemoradioresistance. Finally, we have already
identified novel gene targets that are correlated with SCLC chemoradioresistance.
Our research program is organized as follows: Aim #1: Characterize natural history of response of
experimental models of SCLC to chemoradiation in vivo. We will determine response rates and recurrence
patterns of a panel of SCLC PDXs and transgenic mouse models. Aim #2: Characterization of molecular
underpinnings of SCLC chemoradiation resistance. We will reconstruct gene regulatory networks and gene
expression profiles associated with chemoradiation resistance and develop small-scale predictive classifiers for
therapy response to be validated in follow-up studies. Aim #3: Pharmacologic and genetic validation of
candidate genes for SCLC chemoradiation resistance in vitro and in vivo. We will validate our novel gene
candidates for conferring chemoradiation resistance using pharmacologic and genetic approach with SCLC
PDX-derived organoids and SCLC transgenic mouse models."

This application focuses on developing new targeted therapy for SCLC focusing on two key lineage oncogenes
involved in SCLC pathogenesis and malignant behavior, ASCL1 and NEUROD1. Nearly 90% of SCLCs
express ASCL1, NEUROD1 or both. In the preclinical models, including human SCLC lines and xenografts and
genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) of SCLC, tumors that express either ASCL1 or NEUROD1
appear “addicted” to their expression and function. The presence of ASCL1 or NEUROD1 also are associated
with expression of important downstream oncogenes and regulatory genes. If ASCL1/NEUROD1 are removed
(through genetic knockdown) SCLCs undergo many logs of tumor cell kill. Using state of the art technology in
human preclinical models, we propose to systematically study the dependency of a large number of SCLC
lines and xenografts (including patient derived xenografts, PDXs, and circulating tumor cell derived xenografts,
CDXs) on ASCL1 and NEUROD1 through genetic knockdown, and systematically test the ability of blocking
genetically and pharmacologically downstream potentially “druggable” targets of these two transcription factors
to kill SCLCs. We have three specific aims: Aim 1. Determine ASCL1 and NEUROD1 expression patterns
and clinical and molecular correlates in preclinical SCLC models and tumor specimens; Aim 2. Determine
ASCL1 and NEUROD1 genetic dependency phenotypes, potential molecular biomarkers predicting response,
and frequency and mechanisms of resistance in SCLC preclinical models; Aim 3. Determine the role of ASCL1
and NEUROD1 directly regulated “downstream” targets as vulnerabilities that can be exploited for therapeutic
effect using in vivo xenograft shRNA mini-library “drop out” screens and selected drugs that inhibit downstream
“druggable” targets. As part of these aims we will also determine if resistance to ASCL1 or NEUROD1 targeted
therapy in SCLCs develops using CRISPR-CAS9 technology including potential mechanisms of this
resistance, and we will explore the possible use of ASCL1 and NEUROD1 expression as SCLC enrollment
biomarkers for developing “precision medicine” to predict the response of such targeted therapy in individual
SCLCs. We have developed a large amount of preliminary data on which this application is based including 1)
assembling the world’s largest collection of clinically and molecularly annotated human SCLC lines and
xenografts, as well as important GEMMs of SCLC, 2) generating a comprehensive list of directly regulated
downstream targets of ASCL1 and NEUROD1 through ChipSeq/RNASeq and chromatin landscape studies,
and 3) developing experimental approaches to systematically study the dependency of SCLCs on ASCL1 and
NEUORD1 downstream targets. We have assembled a world class team of investigators, including a patient
advocate, with complementary skills to assure the successful completion of this project. The final deliverables
will serve as the basis for new ASCL1 and NEUROD1 targeted therapeutics for SCLC."	3-Dimensional;ASCL1 gene;Ablation;Advocate;BETA2 protein;Behavior;Biological Assay;Biological Markers;CRISPR/Cas technology;Cancer Model;Cancer Patient;Cancer cell line;Cell Line;Cells;ChIP-seq;Chromatin;Clinical;Collection;Congresses;Data;Data Set;Databases;Dependence;Drops;Drug usage;Enrollment;Family member;Frequencies;Future;Genes;Genetic;Genetically Engineered Mouse;Growth;Health;Human;In Vitro;Individual;Induction of Apoptosis;Knock-out;Knowledge;Libraries;Malignant - descriptor;Malignant Neoplasms;Methodology;Methods;Modeling;Molecular;Molecular and Cellular Biology;Mus;Mutate;NFIB gene;Neoplasm Circulating Cells;Neurosecretory Systems;Oncogenes;Pathogenesis;Patients;Pattern;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacology;Phenotype;Pre-Clinical Model;Prevention approach;Prevention therapy;Proteins;Publishing;Regulator Genes;Research Personnel;Resistance;Role;Specimen;Technology;Testing;Therapeutic;Therapeutic Effect;Translations;Work;Xenograft Model;Xenograft procedure;base;behavior in vitro;cancer survival;cancer therapy;cell killing;clinical translation;clinically translatable;druggable target;in vitro Assay;in vivo;knock-down;lung small cell carcinoma;mRNA Expression;molecular marker;neoplastic cell;new therapeutic target;novel therapeutics;pre-clinical;precision medicine;predicting response;predictive marker;protein expression;resistance frequency;resistance mechanism;response;skills;small hairpin RNA;success;targeted treatment;therapeutic development;therapy development;transcription factor;transcriptome sequencing;tumor	UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER	DALLAS	TX	UNITED STATES	John D.

5U01CA220323-02	U01CA220323	9786689	2019	Using patient-derived models to understand drug responses in SCLC	"PROJECT SUMMARY
Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) afflicts more than 30,000 patients per year and is rapidly fatal in 95% of cases,
with median survival is less than one year. Belying this grim prognosis, treatment-naive SCLC is highly
sensitive to chemotherapy, with response rates in excess of 70% for etoposide/platinum. However, relapse is
nearly inevitable, and relapsed SCLC presents two obstacles that have been insurmountable for at least 30
years: cross-resistance to chemotherapy, and absence of biomarker-driven targeted therapy.
Following relapse, resistance often extends beyond etoposide/platinum, and a disease that was once highly
chemosensitive becomes inexorably progressive. However, the molecular determinants of cross-resistance in
SCLC remain unclear. Although critically important, cross-resistance is difficult to study experimentally, as it
requires a model system that faithfully reproduces clinical outcomes.
Topotecan is the only approved second-line therapy, but NCCN guidelines list 10 agents of nearly equivalent
efficacy. None are particularly effective in unselected patients, and although there is significant molecular
heterogeneity in SCLC, this does not guide patient selection. As novel targets and therapeutic regimens
emerge, biomarker discovery will require a model system that recapitulates the molecular features of patient
tumors, so that molecular heterogeneity can be parsed into clinically meaningful subgroups.
We have generated a panel of 44 SCLC patient-derived xenograft models (PDXs) from biopsy specimens and
circulating tumor cells (CTCs). Our panel includes successive models from individual patients at time points
before and after specific lines of therapy, with detailed information about the corresponding clinical response.
For both standard chemotherapy and experimental agents in clinical trial, these models faithfully mirror patient
responses. However, unlike the patient experience, multiple strategies can be compared for identical tumors.
We propose to use these models to directly compare standard first and second-line chemotherapy with two
experimental regimens that have given promising results in the clinic or in preclinical assays: olaparib plus
temozolomide, in a phase I/II trial at MGH, and a combined Mcl-1/Bcl-2 inhibitors. Individually, these PDX
population trials are designed to reveal biomarkers of sensitivity and mechanisms of resistance for promising
experimental therapies. Collectively, they present a novel opportunity to model cross-resistance through
comparative analysis with reference to the clinical histories of each model.
The successful completion of this work will establish a large collection of PDX models with comprehensive
molecular an functional profiles. In addition, these experiments will investigate the molecular determinants of

1U01CA235625-01	U01CA235625	9670435	2019	Employing CRISPR inactivation screening and in vivo models towards improving treatments for SCLC	"SUMMARY
With a lack of druggable oncogenic mutations in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and no approved targeted
therapies, we need to identify new treatment approaches for SCLC. In this proposal, we apply whole genome
CRISPR inactivation screens to identify genes that are essential for SCLC broadly, or for key genetically defined
subsets. We then determine whether pharmacologic inhibition of identified hits also results in selective killing of
SCLC cells. We apply in vivo systems including patient derived xenograft (PDX) and genetically engineered
mouse models to test pharmacologic inhibitors of key targets identified in these genetic screens. Aim 1 will focus
on a pathway that we already identified using CRISPR inactivation screens to be essential for Rb/p53-mutant
SCLC cells. Components of a NEDD8/RBX1 pathway, controlling Cullin activity and protein ubiquitylation, were
essential for SCLC cells. Pharmacologic inhibition of NEDD8 activating enzyme (NAE) using MLN4924 in patient
derived xenograft (PDX) models confirmed reliance of SCLC cells on this pathway. Excitingly, we identified
examples of exceptional responses to MLN4924 in some PDX models. Aim 1: Apply in vivo models to direct
NEDD8 inhibition to subsets of SCLC most likely to respond. Here, we explore the potential for inhibiting
the NEDD8 pathway in SCLC. We will combine NAE inhibition with cisplatin-etoposide chemotherapy and
determine whether durable responses result. Some SCLC PDX models exhibited exquisite sensitivity to NAE
inhibition; we will identify underlying mechanisms and genetic features of super-responding PDX models that
could be used to help predict exceptional responders. We will determine whether NAE inhibition should be
directed to all SCLC patients, or to key subsets, and whether this approach augments response to chemotherapy.
MLN4924 is already being tested in clinical trials for other cancer types and this work could rapidly lead to clinical
trials in SCLC. Aim 2: Apply CRISPR inactivation screens to identify new therapeutic targets for SCLC.
This Aim will extend our CRISPR inactivation screens to include mouse SCLC cell lines with key driver mutations
beyond Rb/p53, including Pten, Crebbp and Mycl. Our approach takes advantage of the fact that while human
SCLC has an extremely high mutational burden, leading to extensive heterogeneity among SCLC with a given
driver mutation, mouse SCLC with defined driver alterations are more homogenous, increasing signal to noise
in identifying vulnerabilities. We will identify dependencies in genetically-defined subsets of SCLC and will test
inhibitors of identified druggable targets in PDX and GEM models that harbor defined genetic alterations. We
leverage available mouse models and derived cell lines, along with a bank of genetically annotated PDX models,
studied in vivo and ex vivo, to identify and evaluate completely new ways to target key genetic subsets of SCLC."

1U01CA231844-01	U01CA231844	9602351	2018	Genomic and Functional Identification of Chemotherapy Resistance Mechanisms in Small Cell Lung Cancer	"Project Summary
Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is responsible for over 30,000 deaths each year in the United States alone.
SCLC has a two-year survival rate of ~6% and unlike the other major subtypes of lung cancer, there are
currently no targeted therapies approved for SCLC. SCLC is initially highly responsive to chemotherapy, but
rapidly develops resistance leading to mortality in ~10 months. Clearly, a major unmet need for the treatment
of SCLC is the identification of new therapeutic targets and treatment strategies to combat chemo-resistant
disease. Our understanding of chemotherapy resistance mechanisms has been hampered by a lack of
relapsed human SCLC tissue due to rare surgical resections. In addition, there have been few mouse models
of the disease that exhibit short latencies and chemo-sensitivity. To address these challenges, we performed
whole exome sequencing on relapsed SCLC from 30 patients. Relapse-specific genomic alterations in the
WNT/APC/β-catenin pathway were identified in ~66% of relapsed SCLC suggesting that this pathway
promotes chemo-resistance. Second, we developed a novel mouse model of SCLC driven by loss of Rb1,
Trp53 and overexpression of Myc—three of the most common genetic alterations in the human disease. Mice
develop SCLC within weeks that highly resembles the human disease at the level of histopathology, biomarker
expression and chemo-sensitivity followed by relapse. This model will be a useful tool to test candidate
chemotherapy resistance mechanisms and identify novel therapeutic targets that inhibit chemo-resistance. The
objective of this study is to use this novel mouse model and comprehensive genomic analyses of primary and
relapsed human SCLC to identify mechanisms of chemotherapy resistance and novel therapeutic targets to
combat chemo-resistant disease. We hypothesize that activation of the WNT/β-catenin pathway promotes
chemo-resistance in SCLC and that targeted inhibition of the pathway will inhibit chemo-resistant disease. We
predict that expansion of our genomic and transcriptomic profiling will identify additional novel pathways
involved in chemo-resistance. To test these hypotheses, we will: 1) identify recurrent pathway alterations in
relapsed human and mouse SCLC using whole genome, exome, transcriptome and epigenome sequencing
and 2) functionally determine whether canonical WNT/β-catenin signaling and other candidate pathways are
necessary and sufficient for chemo-resistance in SCLC in vivo. This approach is innovative because we will
employ unbiased comprehensive genomic and epigenomic analyses on relapsed human SCLC and a novel
immune-competent mouse model of SCLC that recapitulates key features of the human disease. The WNT/β-
catenin pathway is largely unexplored in SCLC. This research is significant because there are currently no
targeted therapies approved for SCLC. A better understanding of the critical pathways driving chemo-
resistance in SCLC will impact the treatment and survival of patients with this intractable disease."

5U01CA213333-02	U01CA213333	9503705	2018	Targeting the transcriptional and epigenetic landscape in chemo-refractory Small-Cell Lung Cancer	"Summary
Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is characterized by aggressive growth, genomic heterogeneity, and rapid
development of resistance to chemotherapy. SCLC patients frequently demonstrate initial clinical response to
chemotherapy, including the clinical standard of care cisplatin-etoposide regimen, but eventually succumb to
chemo-refractory disease. Recent sequencing studies have demonstrated that SCLC is one of the most highly
mutated cancers, but these efforts have yet to identify targetable `driver' mutations in both chemo-sensitive and
chemo-refractory disease. Using an unbiased, high-throughput cellular screen of a diverse chemical library, we
have identified that SCLC chemo-sensitive and chemo-refractory tumor cells are highly sensitive to inhibitors of
the general transcription apparatus. In particular, we observed that SCLC tumor cells were highly sensitive to
THZ1, a newly identified covalent inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) that functions as a co-factor for
RNA polymerase II (Pol II). We found that this transcriptional vulnerability is conferred, in part, by the exquisite
sensitivity of key super-enhancer (SE) -driven SCLC oncogenes to transcriptional inhibition. We therefore
hypothesize that the inhibition of other transcriptional CDKs found at SEs and their associated genes could
provide additional therapeutic avenues. For this purpose we have developed structure-inspired approaches for
the design of covalent inhibitors targeting various transcriptional CDKs. We further hypothesize that
comparative analysis of enhancer landscapes and gene expression profiles from chemo-naïve and chemo-
refractory primary tumors will 1) identify transcriptional and epigenetic features specific to chemo-refractory
disease, 2) enable grouping into clinically relevant subtypes, and 3) identify transcriptional and epigenetic
dependencies specific to chemo-refractory disease that can be `drugged' using transcriptional CDK inhibitors.
As changes to tumor oncogene expression and chemo-resistance have been shown to impact the immune
compartment, we anticipate that chemo-refractory tumors will also exhibit changes in immune cell activation
and infiltration. By extending our classification of clinical subtypes to the tumor microenvironment, we hope to
find both tumor and immune cell gene expression programs that amenable to small molecule targeting with the
goal of enhancing tumor immune surveillance capabilities. Lastly, as many transcription CDKs are known to
transcriptionally regulate key pathways that modulate the response to DNA-damaging agents and
immunotherapies we will investigate whether transcriptional CDK inhibitors may also be combined with other
investigational SCLC therapies."

5U01CA213273-02	U01CA213273	9537425	2018	Novel therapeutic approaches for enhancing anti-tumor immunity in SCLC	"PROJECT SUMMARY
Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a highly lethal malignancy for which new therapeutic strategies are
desperately needed. One promising avenue is the use of immunotherapy (IMT) agents such as PD-1/PD-L1
pathway inhibitors. Despite its high mutation burden, however, data from our group and others indicate that
SCLC paradoxically has an immunosuppressed phenotype with relatively low levels of infiltrating T-cells,
reduced antigen presentation, and increased levels of CD47, a suppressor of myeloid function. Furthermore,
initial clinical testing suggests that most SCLC tumors often express low or very low levels of PD-L1 and fail to
respond to PD-1 inhibitor monotherapy; IMT resistance also inevitably emerges in responding tumors by
mechanisms that have not yet been characterized. Thus, immunosuppressive mechanisms other than the PD-
1/PD-L1 pathway are likely to play a major role in SCLC, and novel therapeutic approaches and combination
therapies are needed to realize the potential of IMT in SCLC.
The goal of this proposal is to address this issue by identifying new IMT targets and novel combination
regimens, and to rapidly translate them into the clinic. Our team already has promising leads. First, we
identified that SCLC is highly vulnerable to drugs targeting DNA damage repair (DDR) including PARP and
Chk1 inhibitors, a finding now supported by early clinical results. Our preliminary data further suggest that DDR
inhibition may increase PD-L1 expression and, by increasing the production of tumor-associated neoantigens
(TAA), may sensitize tumors to IMT. In Aim 1, we will test whether DDR inhibitors can increase the expression
of TAAs, and enhance the efficacy of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. Second, we have developed a novel strategy for
protecting immune cells from the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapy by using inhibitors of CDK4/6, which can
be used to protect immune cells, but not RB-deficient SCLC cells. In Aim 2, we will test whether CDK4/6
inhibition can enhance the anti-tumor effects of immune cells by protecting them from chemotherapy-induced
cytotoxicity and enable improved chemotherapy/IMT combinations in SCLC. Third, we have identified the
“don't-eat-me” signal CD47 as a novel IMT target for SCLC; blockade of CD47 effectively promotes the
phagocytosis of SCLC cells by macrophages and inhibits tumor growth. In Aim 3, we will test whether targeting
this CD47 myeloid checkpoint can enhance antitumor immunity and the efficacy of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade and
chemotherapy in vivo in SCLC models.
The overall hypothesis tested here is that antitumor immunity can be enhanced in SCLC by targeting all these
processes, leading to more effective IMT combination regimens. These studies will be facilitated by novel
immune-competent pre-clinical murine SCLC models that we have developed and by a multidisciplinary team
including clinical and laboratory investigators, immunologists, pathologists, and others with a record of
innovation in SCLC and IMT and a track record of translating laboratory findings into the clinic."

This application focuses on developing new targeted therapy for SCLC focusing on two key lineage oncogenes
involved in SCLC pathogenesis and malignant behavior, ASCL1 and NEUROD1. Nearly 90% of SCLCs
express ASCL1, NEUROD1 or both. In the preclinical models, including human SCLC lines and xenografts and
genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) of SCLC, tumors that express either ASCL1 or NEUROD1
appear “addicted” to their expression and function. The presence of ASCL1 or NEUROD1 also are associated
with expression of important downstream oncogenes and regulatory genes. If ASCL1/NEUROD1 are removed
(through genetic knockdown) SCLCs undergo many logs of tumor cell kill. Using state of the art technology in
human preclinical models, we propose to systematically study the dependency of a large number of SCLC
lines and xenografts (including patient derived xenografts, PDXs, and circulating tumor cell derived xenografts,
CDXs) on ASCL1 and NEUROD1 through genetic knockdown, and systematically test the ability of blocking
genetically and pharmacologically downstream potentially “druggable” targets of these two transcription factors
to kill SCLCs. We have three specific aims: Aim 1. Determine ASCL1 and NEUROD1 expression patterns
and clinical and molecular correlates in preclinical SCLC models and tumor specimens; Aim 2. Determine
ASCL1 and NEUROD1 genetic dependency phenotypes, potential molecular biomarkers predicting response,
and frequency and mechanisms of resistance in SCLC preclinical models; Aim 3. Determine the role of ASCL1
and NEUROD1 directly regulated “downstream” targets as vulnerabilities that can be exploited for therapeutic
effect using in vivo xenograft shRNA mini-library “drop out” screens and selected drugs that inhibit downstream
“druggable” targets. As part of these aims we will also determine if resistance to ASCL1 or NEUROD1 targeted
therapy in SCLCs develops using CRISPR-CAS9 technology including potential mechanisms of this
resistance, and we will explore the possible use of ASCL1 and NEUROD1 expression as SCLC enrollment
biomarkers for developing “precision medicine” to predict the response of such targeted therapy in individual
SCLCs. We have developed a large amount of preliminary data on which this application is based including 1)
assembling the world’s largest collection of clinically and molecularly annotated human SCLC lines and
xenografts, as well as important GEMMs of SCLC, 2) generating a comprehensive list of directly regulated
downstream targets of ASCL1 and NEUROD1 through ChipSeq/RNASeq and chromatin landscape studies,
and 3) developing experimental approaches to systematically study the dependency of SCLCs on ASCL1 and
NEUORD1 downstream targets. We have assembled a world class team of investigators, including a patient
advocate, with complementary skills to assure the successful completion of this project. The final deliverables
will serve as the basis for new ASCL1 and NEUROD1 targeted therapeutics for SCLC."

1U01CA231776-01	U01CA231776	9601064	2018	Bioinformatic-Chemical Approach to Credential Molecular Targets to Combat Rapid Chemo-Radiation Resistance in SCLC	"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Limited stage small cell lung cancer (LS SCLC), the only curable form of SCLC, is remarkably sensitive to
etoposide plus cisplatin combined with thoracic radiotherapy with response rates > 70%; however, therapy-
refractory recurrence is common. LS SCLC has less than a 25% 5-year overall survival (OS) and ultimately a
strategy for improving long-term SCLC outcomes needs to successfully target tumor cell populations that
survive standard therapy and give rise to recurrent disease. There is, however, a considerable gap in
understanding the specific mechanisms responsible for chemoradiotherapy resistance in SCLC. Our project is
unique among the current portfolio of SCLC funded programs in that we have focused on
chemoradioresistance to increase cure rates in LS SCLC. Recently, our work has suggested using patient-
derived xenograft (PDX) models of SCLC may be an important tool to elucidate mechanisms of therapy
resistance. This approach was remarkably successful, identifying a tolerable and strongly synergistic anti-
SCLC interaction that led to a CTEP-approved trial based on our preclinical data - (NCI #10070; Study Chair:
Hann). In this research program, we will test key hypotheses via three specific aims that will provide more
mechanistic insights into the rapidly emergent chemoradiation resistance observed in LS SCLC.
One central hypothesis of this proposal is that adaptive gene expression changes mediate rapid emergence of
the chemoradiation resistance phenotype in LS SCLC. We have developed a novel chemoradiation treatment
regimen with SCLC PDX models to facilitate these studies. Development and characterization of this novel
model involves a unique collaboration between medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, bioinformaticians,
medical physicists, veterinarians and molecular/cell biologists that is extremely well suited to develop an
integrated program dedicated to resolving questions of SCLC chemoradioresistance. Finally, we have already
identified novel gene targets that are correlated with SCLC chemoradioresistance.
Our research program is organized as follows: Aim #1: Characterize natural history of response of
experimental models of SCLC to chemoradiation in vivo. We will determine response rates and recurrence
patterns of a panel of SCLC PDXs and transgenic mouse models. Aim #2: Characterization of molecular
underpinnings of SCLC chemoradiation resistance. We will reconstruct gene regulatory networks and gene
expression profiles associated with chemoradiation resistance and develop small-scale predictive classifiers for
therapy response to be validated in follow-up studies. Aim #3: Pharmacologic and genetic validation of
candidate genes for SCLC chemoradiation resistance in vitro and in vivo. We will validate our novel gene
candidates for conferring chemoradiation resistance using pharmacologic and genetic approach with SCLC
PDX-derived organoids and SCLC transgenic mouse models."

5U01CA213359-02	U01CA213359	9432491	2018	Preclinical development of a DLL3-targeted theranostic for small cell lung cancer	"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is remarkable for exceptionally high metastatic potential, initial robust
response to DNA damaging agents, and near universal development of resistance. This combination of
predilection for early metastasis acquired treatment resistance – often times manifested as cross resistance to
multiple agents – highlights a critical need for novel systemic therapies operating through a novel mechanism
in order to achieve improved patient outcomes.
 Delta-like ligand 3 (DLL3), has recently been identified as a therapeutic target in SCLC. The highly
tumor-selective surface expression of this protein make it an excellent candidate target for an antibody drug
conjugate (ADC). Rovalpituzumab tesserine (Rova-T) is one such ADC that is showing encouraging efficacy
signals in the clinic. However, despite apparent clinical benefit, this agent has also been associated with some
severe adverse events attributable to the presence of the anthracycline PBD warhead. DLL3 targeting
approaches are in need of both a real-time, quantitative diagnostic biomarker and a therapeutic approach with
reduced toxicity.
 We propose a theranostic approach comprising on 89Zr immunoPET and a 90Y/177Lu
radioimmunotherapeutic. The first Aim improves upon already promising bioconjugation chemistry. We are
already able to obtain high-contrast immunoPET images using non-specific amine labeling and site-specific
maleimide bioconjugation. We will improve upon this approach by developing more stable thiol-clickable
methylsuflone chelators for 89Zr and 90Y/177Lu to minimize kidney dose. The second Aim identifies preclinical
dosing parameters and comprehensively optimizes efficacy and toxicity in a traditional cell line xenograft. Our
preliminary imaging data is focused on H82, an SCLC cell lined derived from a chemoexperienced patient. This
cell line is very resistant to etoposide in vitro and in vivo and will be used to identify a radiotherapy dose that
demonstrates efficacy in vivo, while minimizing dose to the kidney. Different dose ranges and schedules will be
explored. The final Aim explores radiotherapy in a variety of in vivo contexts including lesion sizes ranging from
0.1 to 10 mm in diameter and representing both chemonaïve and chemoresistant disease. Radioisotopes have
different energy deposition depending on the volume of the tumor being targeted. We will evaluate 90Y and
177Lu radioisotopes in different in vivo models of small cell lung cancer for the ability to eradicate lesions of
different sizes. A unique resource in the lab is our collection of 10 paired chemonaïve and chemoresistant
patient-derived xenograft lines. We will place particular emphasis on establishing efficacy in the context of

1U01CA220323-01A1	U01CA220323	9602353	2018	Using patient-derived models to understand drug responses in SCLC	"PROJECT SUMMARY
Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) afflicts more than 30,000 patients per year and is rapidly fatal in 95% of cases,
with median survival is less than one year. Belying this grim prognosis, treatment-naive SCLC is highly
sensitive to chemotherapy, with response rates in excess of 70% for etoposide/platinum. However, relapse is
nearly inevitable, and relapsed SCLC presents two obstacles that have been insurmountable for at least 30
years: cross-resistance to chemotherapy, and absence of biomarker-driven targeted therapy.
Following relapse, resistance often extends beyond etoposide/platinum, and a disease that was once highly
chemosensitive becomes inexorably progressive. However, the molecular determinants of cross-resistance in
SCLC remain unclear. Although critically important, cross-resistance is difficult to study experimentally, as it
requires a model system that faithfully reproduces clinical outcomes.
Topotecan is the only approved second-line therapy, but NCCN guidelines list 10 agents of nearly equivalent
efficacy. None are particularly effective in unselected patients, and although there is significant molecular
heterogeneity in SCLC, this does not guide patient selection. As novel targets and therapeutic regimens
emerge, biomarker discovery will require a model system that recapitulates the molecular features of patient
tumors, so that molecular heterogeneity can be parsed into clinically meaningful subgroups.
We have generated a panel of 44 SCLC patient-derived xenograft models (PDXs) from biopsy specimens and
circulating tumor cells (CTCs). Our panel includes successive models from individual patients at time points
before and after specific lines of therapy, with detailed information about the corresponding clinical response.
For both standard chemotherapy and experimental agents in clinical trial, these models faithfully mirror patient
responses. However, unlike the patient experience, multiple strategies can be compared for identical tumors.
We propose to use these models to directly compare standard first and second-line chemotherapy with two
experimental regimens that have given promising results in the clinic or in preclinical assays: olaparib plus
temozolomide, in a phase I/II trial at MGH, and a combined Mcl-1/Bcl-2 inhibitors. Individually, these PDX
population trials are designed to reveal biomarkers of sensitivity and mechanisms of resistance for promising
experimental therapies. Collectively, they present a novel opportunity to model cross-resistance through
comparative analysis with reference to the clinical histories of each model.
The successful completion of this work will establish a large collection of PDX models with comprehensive
molecular an functional profiles. In addition, these experiments will investigate the molecular determinants of
cross-resistance following chemotherapy, a problem that has beleaguered management of SCLC for over
three decades."

1U01CA213359-01	U01CA213359	9246182	2017	Preclinical development of a DLL3-targeted theranostic for small cell lung cancer	"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is remarkable for exceptionally high metastatic potential, initial robust
response to DNA damaging agents, and near universal development of resistance. This combination of
predilection for early metastasis acquired treatment resistance – often times manifested as cross resistance to
multiple agents – highlights a critical need for novel systemic therapies operating through a novel mechanism
in order to achieve improved patient outcomes.
 Delta-like ligand 3 (DLL3), has recently been identified as a therapeutic target in SCLC. The highly
tumor-selective surface expression of this protein make it an excellent candidate target for an antibody drug
conjugate (ADC). Rovalpituzumab tesserine (Rova-T) is one such ADC that is showing encouraging efficacy
signals in the clinic. However, despite apparent clinical benefit, this agent has also been associated with some
severe adverse events attributable to the presence of the anthracycline PBD warhead. DLL3 targeting
approaches are in need of both a real-time, quantitative diagnostic biomarker and a therapeutic approach with
reduced toxicity.
 We propose a theranostic approach comprising on 89Zr immunoPET and a 90Y/177Lu
radioimmunotherapeutic. The first Aim improves upon already promising bioconjugation chemistry. We are
already able to obtain high-contrast immunoPET images using non-specific amine labeling and site-specific
maleimide bioconjugation. We will improve upon this approach by developing more stable thiol-clickable
methylsuflone chelators for 89Zr and 90Y/177Lu to minimize kidney dose. The second Aim identifies preclinical
dosing parameters and comprehensively optimizes efficacy and toxicity in a traditional cell line xenograft. Our
preliminary imaging data is focused on H82, an SCLC cell lined derived from a chemoexperienced patient. This
cell line is very resistant to etoposide in vitro and in vivo and will be used to identify a radiotherapy dose that
demonstrates efficacy in vivo, while minimizing dose to the kidney. Different dose ranges and schedules will be
explored. The final Aim explores radiotherapy in a variety of in vivo contexts including lesion sizes ranging from
0.1 to 10 mm in diameter and representing both chemonaïve and chemoresistant disease. Radioisotopes have
different energy deposition depending on the volume of the tumor being targeted. We will evaluate 90Y and
177Lu radioisotopes in different in vivo models of small cell lung cancer for the ability to eradicate lesions of
different sizes. A unique resource in the lab is our collection of 10 paired chemonaïve and chemoresistant
patient-derived xenograft lines. We will place particular emphasis on establishing efficacy in the context of
acquired chemoresistance.

This application focuses on developing new targeted therapy for SCLC focusing on two key lineage oncogenes
involved in SCLC pathogenesis and malignant behavior, ASCL1 and NEUROD1. Nearly 90% of SCLCs
express ASCL1, NEUROD1 or both. In the preclinical models, including human SCLC lines and xenografts and
genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) of SCLC, tumors that express either ASCL1 or NEUROD1
appear “addicted” to their expression and function. The presence of ASCL1 or NEUROD1 also are associated
with expression of important downstream oncogenes and regulatory genes. If ASCL1/NEUROD1 are removed
(through genetic knockdown) SCLCs undergo many logs of tumor cell kill. Using state of the art technology in
human preclinical models, we propose to systematically study the dependency of a large number of SCLC
lines and xenografts (including patient derived xenografts, PDXs, and circulating tumor cell derived xenografts,
CDXs) on ASCL1 and NEUROD1 through genetic knockdown, and systematically test the ability of blocking
genetically and pharmacologically downstream potentially “druggable” targets of these two transcription factors
to kill SCLCs. We have three specific aims: Aim 1. Determine ASCL1 and NEUROD1 expression patterns
and clinical and molecular correlates in preclinical SCLC models and tumor specimens; Aim 2. Determine
ASCL1 and NEUROD1 genetic dependency phenotypes, potential molecular biomarkers predicting response,
and frequency and mechanisms of resistance in SCLC preclinical models; Aim 3. Determine the role of ASCL1
and NEUROD1 directly regulated “downstream” targets as vulnerabilities that can be exploited for therapeutic
effect using in vivo xenograft shRNA mini-library “drop out” screens and selected drugs that inhibit downstream
“druggable” targets. As part of these aims we will also determine if resistance to ASCL1 or NEUROD1 targeted
therapy in SCLCs develops using CRISPR-CAS9 technology including potential mechanisms of this
resistance, and we will explore the possible use of ASCL1 and NEUROD1 expression as SCLC enrollment
biomarkers for developing “precision medicine” to predict the response of such targeted therapy in individual
SCLCs. We have developed a large amount of preliminary data on which this application is based including 1)
assembling the world’s largest collection of clinically and molecularly annotated human SCLC lines and
xenografts, as well as important GEMMs of SCLC, 2) generating a comprehensive list of directly regulated
downstream targets of ASCL1 and NEUROD1 through ChipSeq/RNASeq and chromatin landscape studies,
and 3) developing experimental approaches to systematically study the dependency of SCLCs on ASCL1 and
NEUORD1 downstream targets. We have assembled a world class team of investigators, including a patient
advocate, with complementary skills to assure the successful completion of this project. The final deliverables
will serve as the basis for new ASCL1 and NEUROD1 targeted therapeutics for SCLC."

1U01CA213273-01A1	U01CA213273	9387223	2017	Novel therapeutic approaches for enhancing anti-tumor immunity in SCLC	"PROJECT SUMMARY
Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a highly lethal malignancy for which new therapeutic strategies are
desperately needed. One promising avenue is the use of immunotherapy (IMT) agents such as PD-1/PD-L1
pathway inhibitors. Despite its high mutation burden, however, data from our group and others indicate that
SCLC paradoxically has an immunosuppressed phenotype with relatively low levels of infiltrating T-cells,
reduced antigen presentation, and increased levels of CD47, a suppressor of myeloid function. Furthermore,
initial clinical testing suggests that most SCLC tumors often express low or very low levels of PD-L1 and fail to
respond to PD-1 inhibitor monotherapy; IMT resistance also inevitably emerges in responding tumors by
mechanisms that have not yet been characterized. Thus, immunosuppressive mechanisms other than the PD-
1/PD-L1 pathway are likely to play a major role in SCLC, and novel therapeutic approaches and combination
therapies are needed to realize the potential of IMT in SCLC.
The goal of this proposal is to address this issue by identifying new IMT targets and novel combination
regimens, and to rapidly translate them into the clinic. Our team already has promising leads. First, we
identified that SCLC is highly vulnerable to drugs targeting DNA damage repair (DDR) including PARP and
Chk1 inhibitors, a finding now supported by early clinical results. Our preliminary data further suggest that DDR
inhibition may increase PD-L1 expression and, by increasing the production of tumor-associated neoantigens
(TAA), may sensitize tumors to IMT. In Aim 1, we will test whether DDR inhibitors can increase the expression
of TAAs, and enhance the efficacy of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. Second, we have developed a novel strategy for
protecting immune cells from the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapy by using inhibitors of CDK4/6, which can
be used to protect immune cells, but not RB-deficient SCLC cells. In Aim 2, we will test whether CDK4/6
inhibition can enhance the anti-tumor effects of immune cells by protecting them from chemotherapy-induced
cytotoxicity and enable improved chemotherapy/IMT combinations in SCLC. Third, we have identified the
“don't-eat-me” signal CD47 as a novel IMT target for SCLC; blockade of CD47 effectively promotes the
phagocytosis of SCLC cells by macrophages and inhibits tumor growth. In Aim 3, we will test whether targeting
this CD47 myeloid checkpoint can enhance antitumor immunity and the efficacy of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade and
chemotherapy in vivo in SCLC models.
The overall hypothesis tested here is that antitumor immunity can be enhanced in SCLC by targeting all these
processes, leading to more effective IMT combination regimens. These studies will be facilitated by novel
immune-competent pre-clinical murine SCLC models that we have developed and by a multidisciplinary team
including clinical and laboratory investigators, immunologists, pathologists, and others with a record of
innovation in SCLC and IMT and a track record of translating laboratory findings into the clinic."

1U01CA213333-01	U01CA213333	9245923	2017	Targeting the transcriptional and epigenetic landscape in chemo-refractory Small-Cell Lung Cancer	"Summary
Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is characterized by aggressive growth, genomic heterogeneity, and rapid
development of resistance to chemotherapy. SCLC patients frequently demonstrate initial clinical response to
chemotherapy, including the clinical standard of care cisplatin-etoposide regimen, but eventually succumb to
chemo-refractory disease. Recent sequencing studies have demonstrated that SCLC is one of the most highly
mutated cancers, but these efforts have yet to identify targetable `driver' mutations in both chemo-sensitive and
chemo-refractory disease. Using an unbiased, high-throughput cellular screen of a diverse chemical library, we
have identified that SCLC chemo-sensitive and chemo-refractory tumor cells are highly sensitive to inhibitors of
the general transcription apparatus. In particular, we observed that SCLC tumor cells were highly sensitive to
THZ1, a newly identified covalent inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) that functions as a co-factor for
RNA polymerase II (Pol II). We found that this transcriptional vulnerability is conferred, in part, by the exquisite
sensitivity of key super-enhancer (SE) -driven SCLC oncogenes to transcriptional inhibition. We therefore
hypothesize that the inhibition of other transcriptional CDKs found at SEs and their associated genes could
provide additional therapeutic avenues. For this purpose we have developed structure-inspired approaches for
the design of covalent inhibitors targeting various transcriptional CDKs. We further hypothesize that
comparative analysis of enhancer landscapes and gene expression profiles from chemo-naïve and chemo-
refractory primary tumors will 1) identify transcriptional and epigenetic features specific to chemo-refractory
disease, 2) enable grouping into clinically relevant subtypes, and 3) identify transcriptional and epigenetic
dependencies specific to chemo-refractory disease that can be `drugged' using transcriptional CDK inhibitors.
As changes to tumor oncogene expression and chemo-resistance have been shown to impact the immune
compartment, we anticipate that chemo-refractory tumors will also exhibit changes in immune cell activation
and infiltration. By extending our classification of clinical subtypes to the tumor microenvironment, we hope to
find both tumor and immune cell gene expression programs that amenable to small molecule targeting with the
goal of enhancing tumor immune surveillance capabilities. Lastly, as many transcription CDKs are known to
transcriptionally regulate key pathways that modulate the response to DNA-damaging agents and
immunotherapies we will investigate whether transcriptional CDK inhibitors may also be combined with other
investigational SCLC therapies."

5U01CA224276-05	U01CA224276	10472576	2022	Phenotype Interactions in SCLC Development and Detection	"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Small Cell Lung Carcinoma (SCLC) is an aggressive neuroendocrine subtype of lung cancer. SCLC
patients have a very low 5-year survival, in part because SCLC tumors are often detected at a late stage when
the tumors have already metastasized and treatment outcomes are worse. Thus, early detection becomes
critical to achieve better treatment results. Emerging evidence supports the idea that, while SCLC tumors seem
homogeneous when examined under a microscope, these tumors contain a significant level of intra-tumoral
heterogeneity. Indeed, recent observations by our group and others have identified distinct cellular phenotypes
in SCLC, including in primary human tumors, in cell lines derived from human tumors, and in tumors from
genetically-engineered mouse models. Importantly, data from our group indicate that these cellular phenotypes
contribute to SCLC development. The specific goal of this proposal is to elucidate how different cellular
subpopulations within SCLC tumors drive early SCLC development, dynamics, and growth and to leverage this
mechanistic information to identify biomarkers for early detection and prevention of SCLC.
 We have previously identified tumor-propagating cells (TPCs) in SCLC tumors and found that these cells
are neuroendocrine and strongly tumorigenic. We have also characterized cell populations derived from these
TPCs with distinct phenotypes, including non-neuroendocrine NOTCH+ and CD44+ subpopulations, that
promote the growth and survival of the neuroendocrine TPCs. Leveraging these findings as well as our unique
genetic mouse models that allow dissection of SCLC phenotype evolution, we will investigate how cell-cell
interactions of these distinct SCLC cell phenotypes contribute to tumor development and growth, in relationship
with the tumor microenvironment. We will also elucidate the role of secretory factors released by these SCLC
subpopulations in driving survival, growth, and phenotype composition of SCLC tumors. Finally, we will
perform analysis of cfDNA and proteins (including on exosomes) present in SCLC patient plasma for
identification of related markers of SCLC development and early detection. We will also follow up on intriguing
findings that germline mutations in NOTCH are present in a large fraction of SCLC patients, suggesting a
potential risk marker beyond smoking.
 This interdisciplinary basic-translational project will elucidate fundamental mechanisms of SCLC
development and may lead to novel methods for early detection and/or prevention of SCLC."

5U01CA231851-05	U01CA231851	10469595	2022	Molecular mechanisms of SCLC initiation and detection in mice and humans	"Small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) is one of the deadliest cancers, a “recalcitrant” cancer for which there
is no effective treatment except when the disease is diagnosed early. However, only a small fraction of patients
are diagnosed early in disease. The greatest challenge to early diagnosis is that SCLC tumor cells typically
acquire an exceptional mutation burden and metastasize early, so for most patients disease has spread
beyond the lung at the time of diagnosis. The key to developing effective early diagnosis and treatment
methods is to elucidate the earliest molecular and cellular events of tumor initiation to uncover ones that can
be detected by screening during the premalignant phase of the disease. The goal of this proposal is to define
the early, premalignant molecular and cellular events of SCLC, so that they can be detected early and
destroyed before they become a deadly, untreatable disease.
 SCLC is a neuroendocrine cancer. The prominent cell of origin is pulmonary neuroendocrine (NE) cells,
neurosensory and neurosecretory epithelial cells that sense and respond to the environment in the lung.
Recently, a minor subpopulation of NE cells was found to have stem cell activity, proliferating, dispersing, and
replenishing the surrounding bronchial epithelium following severe airway injury. Loss of tumor suppressors Rb
and p53 constitutively activates the stem cell program within days of loss of the tumor suppressors, even in the
absence of injury. In this proposal, a combination of genetics, cell culture, and single-cell genomics is used to
systematically interrogate these stem cells at cellular resolution, both in healthy lungs and in the early,
premalignant stage of SCLC. The goal is to define the molecular events immediately following loss of Rb and
p53 that constitutively activate the stem cell program and initiate their transformation into cancer stem cells that
spread, mutate, and escape immune destruction, and to identify the signals they secrete that might allow the
tumors to be detected before they become deadly."

5U01CA224293-05	U01CA224293	10465194	2022	Targeting BCAT1 and branched-chain amino acid metabolism for the detection and prevention of SCLC	"Summary
The high mortality of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is largely due to its invariable resistance to current
cytotoxic therapies. Chemoprevention has been considered as an alternative to existing therapeutics on the
basis of long tumor latency and the well-defined high-risk population (e.g. smokers). Identification of tractable
targets for prevention and early detection requires an understanding of molecular changes underlying early-
stage tumor development. We found that enhanced ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis are critical for
MYC family-driven transformation of precancerous precursors (preSC) into fully tumorigenic cells. Both human
and mouse SCLC cells are extremely sensitive to a specific inhibitor of ribosome biogenesis that has also been
shown to reduce tumor growth in a genetically engineered mouse model. Analysis of the MYC-driven
oncogenic gene signature revealed branched-chain aminotransferase 1 (BCAT1) as a potential modulator of
both metabolic adaptation and related stress response to promote cellular homeostasis. BCAT1 is an enzyme
that catalyzes transfer of the α-amino nitrogen from branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs including leucine) to
α-ketoglutarate to produce branched-chain α-keto acids (BCKAs) and glutamate. This enzyme routes BCAAs
into multiple metabolite pools for biosynthesis and regulates levels of BCAAs, specifically leucine, that
stimulate protein synthesis by acting as indicators of nutrient availability. BCAT1 has recently been implicated
in multiple types of cancers, including glioblastoma and mouse Kras/p53-driven lung adenocarcinoma. In this
application, we will test the hypotheses that enhanced BCAT1 promotes SCLC development by controlling
protein synthesis and stress response, and that altered levels of BCAA metabolites inform early BCAT1-
dependent SCLC development. To test these hypotheses, we propose the following Aims. Aim 1: To determine
the necessity of BCAT1 for SCLC development, we will evaluate the tumor suppressive effects of knocking out
Bcat1 and examine the effects of pharmacological inhibition of BCAT1 on SCLC development and long-term
survival in vivo. Aim 2: To determine the role of BCAT1 in protein synthesis and stress response during SCLC
development, we will manipulate BCAT1 and determine the resulting impact on biochemical interactions
among related proteins and pathways that influence proliferation and survival of L-Myc-induced transforming
cells, a model of early stage SCLC. We will also determine the significance of BCAA metabolism in tumor
development in vivo by setting up variable conditions that mimic different outcomes of the metabolic reaction
using a BCAA-defined diet. Aim 3: To test alterations in BCAA metabolites as biomarkers for BCAT1-
dependent SCLC development, we will monitor changes in plasma BCAA and BCKA levels during SCLC
development in vivo and examine the clinical correlation of plasma levels of these metabolites with a SCLC
diagnosis. The expected outcome of this proposal will provide critical insights into novel strategies for targeted
prevention using minimally invasive detection methods and intervention using low-toxicity drugs or nutrition."

5U01CA224326-05	U01CA224326	10358503	2022	Studies of the initiation and progression of small cell lung cancer using cells derived by differentiation from human pluripotent stem cells	"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an especially virulent form of lung cancer that is
only transiently responsive to therapy and kills about 30,000 Americans each year.
Based on a more general interest in understanding why certain kinds of cancers have
characteristic genotypes, we are developing methods for studying the initiation of human
cancers by genetically modifying cells at discrete stages of differentiation after chemical
induction of specific lineages from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). We have
extended recently published methods for inducing hESCs to form parts of the pulmonary
lineage by perturbing NOTCH signaling and reducing expression of the RB1 gene (one of
the two genes commonly inactivated in SCLC); in this way, we have prepared cultures
with high proportions of pulmonary neuroendocrine cells (PNECs), the putative
precursors of SCLC. Moreover, by also reducing expression of P53, the other gene
commonly inactivated in SCLC, PNEC-containing cultures are able to produce small
tumors resembling SCLC when implanted in immune-deficient mice.
 We now propose to expand our studies of this promising model for studying the
origins of SCLC in several ways: by determining the mechanisms by which interference
with NOTCH and RB1 generates PNECs; by exploring several possible assays for the
SCLC-like phenotype we have recently observed; by defining the similarities between the
genetic and physiological features of the SCLCs derived from hESCs and the SCLCs
arising in human patients; and by making induced pleuropotent stem cells (iPSCs) from
normal and tumor cells from patients with lung cancer, especially SCLC, in an effort to
seek genetic risk factors for SCLC. Through these studies, we expect to generate new
information and ideas about risk assessment, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment for
SCLC.

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. While the implementation of lung cancer
screening for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) subtypes has brought significant hope to this disease, very
limited options exist for the early detection of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) SCLC carries a 5-year survival rate
of only 7% and despite the development of novel targeted therapies and early detection for NSCLC, no such
advances have been achieved in SCLC. A gap in our current approach to lung cancer detection and treatment
has been that informative and reliable biomarkers for the detection and surveillance of lung cancer have
remained elusive. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as viable biomarkers in body fluids thus, providing an
excellent means to achieve non-invasive assays for early cancer detection. Furthermore, miRNA expression in
circulation appears to be compartment specific. While the majority of miRNAs are intracellular, a significant
number of miRNAs have been observed outside of cells, including in various bodily fluids. The origin,
applications and potential functionality of RNAs in circulation are the sources of intriguing questions. Obtaining
a detailed RNA spectrum in plasma would shed some light on this matter. We have taken a multidisciplinary
approach to the investigation of circulating RNA transcripts that integrates expertise in miRNA biology,
nanoengineering, lung cancer and bioinformatics. We have developed a simple tethered Cationic Lipoplex
Nanoparticle (tCLN) biochip with pre-loaded molecular beacons (MBs) in the lipoplex nanoparticles as probes
to capture and detect targeted miRNAs and mRNAs in human plasma without any need of pre- or post-sample
treatment. We have successfully demonstrated the ability to assess both exosomal miRNAs and mRNAs using
both Next Generation Sequencing and our tCLN biochip in cohorts of control smokers and patients with early
stage NSCLC. Our primary objectives are to extend these novel findings by (1) Test and validate the utility of
measurement of ASCL1 and DLL3 in the early detection of SCLC in a retrospective and prospective study with
network samples (2) Develop A Panel of Comprehensive EV RNA Candidates using nest generation

5U01CA231851-04	U01CA231851	10245149	2021	Molecular mechanisms of SCLC initiation and detection in mice and humans	"Small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) is one of the deadliest cancers, a “recalcitrant” cancer for which there
is no effective treatment except when the disease is diagnosed early. However, only a small fraction of patients
are diagnosed early in disease. The greatest challenge to early diagnosis is that SCLC tumor cells typically
acquire an exceptional mutation burden and metastasize early, so for most patients disease has spread
beyond the lung at the time of diagnosis. The key to developing effective early diagnosis and treatment
methods is to elucidate the earliest molecular and cellular events of tumor initiation to uncover ones that can
be detected by screening during the premalignant phase of the disease. The goal of this proposal is to define
the early, premalignant molecular and cellular events of SCLC, so that they can be detected early and
destroyed before they become a deadly, untreatable disease.
 SCLC is a neuroendocrine cancer. The prominent cell of origin is pulmonary neuroendocrine (NE) cells,
neurosensory and neurosecretory epithelial cells that sense and respond to the environment in the lung.
Recently, a minor subpopulation of NE cells was found to have stem cell activity, proliferating, dispersing, and
replenishing the surrounding bronchial epithelium following severe airway injury. Loss of tumor suppressors Rb
and p53 constitutively activates the stem cell program within days of loss of the tumor suppressors, even in the
absence of injury. In this proposal, a combination of genetics, cell culture, and single-cell genomics is used to
systematically interrogate these stem cells at cellular resolution, both in healthy lungs and in the early,
premalignant stage of SCLC. The goal is to define the molecular events immediately following loss of Rb and
p53 that constitutively activate the stem cell program and initiate their transformation into cancer stem cells that
spread, mutate, and escape immune destruction, and to identify the signals they secrete that might allow the
tumors to be detected before they become deadly."

 Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an especially virulent form of lung cancer that is
only transiently responsive to therapy and kills about 30,000 Americans each year.
Based on a more general interest in understanding why certain kinds of cancers have
characteristic genotypes, we are developing methods for studying the initiation of human
cancers by genetically modifying cells at discrete stages of differentiation after chemical
induction of specific lineages from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). We have
extended recently published methods for inducing hESCs to form parts of the pulmonary
lineage by perturbing NOTCH signaling and reducing expression of the RB1 gene (one of
the two genes commonly inactivated in SCLC); in this way, we have prepared cultures
with high proportions of pulmonary neuroendocrine cells (PNECs), the putative
precursors of SCLC. Moreover, by also reducing expression of P53, the other gene
commonly inactivated in SCLC, PNEC-containing cultures are able to produce small
tumors resembling SCLC when implanted in immune-deficient mice.
 We now propose to expand our studies of this promising model for studying the
origins of SCLC in several ways: by determining the mechanisms by which interference
with NOTCH and RB1 generates PNECs; by exploring several possible assays for the
SCLC-like phenotype we have recently observed; by defining the similarities between the
genetic and physiological features of the SCLCs derived from hESCs and the SCLCs
arising in human patients; and by making induced pleuropotent stem cells (iPSCs) from
normal and tumor cells from patients with lung cancer, especially SCLC, in an effort to
seek genetic risk factors for SCLC. Through these studies, we expect to generate new
information and ideas about risk assessment, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment for
SCLC.

5U01CA224293-04	U01CA224293	10241289	2021	Targeting BCAT1 and branched-chain amino acid metabolism for the detection and prevention of SCLC	"Summary
The high mortality of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is largely due to its invariable resistance to current
cytotoxic therapies. Chemoprevention has been considered as an alternative to existing therapeutics on the
basis of long tumor latency and the well-defined high-risk population (e.g. smokers). Identification of tractable
targets for prevention and early detection requires an understanding of molecular changes underlying early-
stage tumor development. We found that enhanced ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis are critical for
MYC family-driven transformation of precancerous precursors (preSC) into fully tumorigenic cells. Both human
and mouse SCLC cells are extremely sensitive to a specific inhibitor of ribosome biogenesis that has also been
shown to reduce tumor growth in a genetically engineered mouse model. Analysis of the MYC-driven
oncogenic gene signature revealed branched-chain aminotransferase 1 (BCAT1) as a potential modulator of
both metabolic adaptation and related stress response to promote cellular homeostasis. BCAT1 is an enzyme
that catalyzes transfer of the α-amino nitrogen from branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs including leucine) to
α-ketoglutarate to produce branched-chain α-keto acids (BCKAs) and glutamate. This enzyme routes BCAAs
into multiple metabolite pools for biosynthesis and regulates levels of BCAAs, specifically leucine, that
stimulate protein synthesis by acting as indicators of nutrient availability. BCAT1 has recently been implicated
in multiple types of cancers, including glioblastoma and mouse Kras/p53-driven lung adenocarcinoma. In this
application, we will test the hypotheses that enhanced BCAT1 promotes SCLC development by controlling
protein synthesis and stress response, and that altered levels of BCAA metabolites inform early BCAT1-
dependent SCLC development. To test these hypotheses, we propose the following Aims. Aim 1: To determine
the necessity of BCAT1 for SCLC development, we will evaluate the tumor suppressive effects of knocking out
Bcat1 and examine the effects of pharmacological inhibition of BCAT1 on SCLC development and long-term
survival in vivo. Aim 2: To determine the role of BCAT1 in protein synthesis and stress response during SCLC
development, we will manipulate BCAT1 and determine the resulting impact on biochemical interactions
among related proteins and pathways that influence proliferation and survival of L-Myc-induced transforming
cells, a model of early stage SCLC. We will also determine the significance of BCAA metabolism in tumor
development in vivo by setting up variable conditions that mimic different outcomes of the metabolic reaction
using a BCAA-defined diet. Aim 3: To test alterations in BCAA metabolites as biomarkers for BCAT1-
dependent SCLC development, we will monitor changes in plasma BCAA and BCKA levels during SCLC
development in vivo and examine the clinical correlation of plasma levels of these metabolites with a SCLC
diagnosis. The expected outcome of this proposal will provide critical insights into novel strategies for targeted
prevention using minimally invasive detection methods and intervention using low-toxicity drugs or nutrition."

The goal of this proposal by a multi-disciplinary team at MD Anderson Cancer Center, the
University of Texas Southwestern Cancer Center and the University of Pittsburg Cancer Center
is to explore approaches based on circulating protein markers and autoantibodies to develop a
blood based marker panel to assess risk of harboring or developing small cell lung cancer
(SCLC). There are currently several established SCLC protein markers which individually lack
sufficient performance for early detection. Additionally, the applicant group has uncovered
several protein marker candidates through integrated analyses of mouse models and human
SCLC samples. To assess the potential of established and newly discovered candidate markers
to yield a combined panel of markers indicative of risk of harboring or developing SCLC,
validation studies will be conducted using plasma samples collected up to 5 years prior to a
diagnosis of SCLC, from participants in the large European Prospective Investigation into
Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) and the Singapore Chinese Health Study (SCHS) cohorts.
Additonally, plasmas collected at the time of diagnosis of SCLC and post-treatment as well as
tissue molecular profiles will be interrogated to establish the biological relevance to candidates
to SCLC. Two approaches will be implemented to identify antigenic proteins and peptides that
induce autoantibodies that can be mined for SCLC early detection. One consisting of Ig bound
proteins in plasmas from SCLC cases and another novel approach consists of interrogating
whole genome derived peptide arrays for reactivity with aliquots of SCLC plasmas utilized for
validation of circulating proteins. The resulting combination of the most promising markers will
be further validated using pre-diagnostic SCLC samples and matched controls from the US

 Small Cell Lung Carcinoma (SCLC) is an aggressive neuroendocrine subtype of lung cancer. SCLC
patients have a very low 5-year survival, in part because SCLC tumors are often detected at a late stage when
the tumors have already metastasized and treatment outcomes are worse. Thus, early detection becomes
critical to achieve better treatment results. Emerging evidence supports the idea that, while SCLC tumors seem
homogeneous when examined under a microscope, these tumors contain a significant level of intra-tumoral
heterogeneity. Indeed, recent observations by our group and others have identified distinct cellular phenotypes
in SCLC, including in primary human tumors, in cell lines derived from human tumors, and in tumors from
genetically-engineered mouse models. Importantly, data from our group indicate that these cellular phenotypes
contribute to SCLC development. The specific goal of this proposal is to elucidate how different cellular
subpopulations within SCLC tumors drive early SCLC development, dynamics, and growth and to leverage this
mechanistic information to identify biomarkers for early detection and prevention of SCLC.
 We have previously identified tumor-propagating cells (TPCs) in SCLC tumors and found that these cells
are neuroendocrine and strongly tumorigenic. We have also characterized cell populations derived from these
TPCs with distinct phenotypes, including non-neuroendocrine NOTCH+ and CD44+ subpopulations, that
promote the growth and survival of the neuroendocrine TPCs. Leveraging these findings as well as our unique
genetic mouse models that allow dissection of SCLC phenotype evolution, we will investigate how cell-cell
interactions of these distinct SCLC cell phenotypes contribute to tumor development and growth, in relationship
with the tumor microenvironment. We will also elucidate the role of secretory factors released by these SCLC
subpopulations in driving survival, growth, and phenotype composition of SCLC tumors. Finally, we will
perform analysis of cfDNA and proteins (including on exosomes) present in SCLC patient plasma for
identification of related markers of SCLC development and early detection. We will also follow up on intriguing
findings that germline mutations in NOTCH are present in a large fraction of SCLC patients, suggesting a
potential risk marker beyond smoking.
 This interdisciplinary basic-translational project will elucidate fundamental mechanisms of SCLC
development and may lead to novel methods for early detection and/or prevention of SCLC."

 Small Cell Lung Carcinoma (SCLC) is an aggressive neuroendocrine subtype of lung cancer. SCLC
patients have a very low 5-year survival, in part because SCLC tumors are often detected at a late stage when
the tumors have already metastasized and treatment outcomes are worse. Thus, early detection becomes
critical to achieve better treatment results. Emerging evidence supports the idea that, while SCLC tumors seem
homogeneous when examined under a microscope, these tumors contain a significant level of intra-tumoral
heterogeneity. Indeed, recent observations by our group and others have identified distinct cellular phenotypes
in SCLC, including in primary human tumors, in cell lines derived from human tumors, and in tumors from
genetically-engineered mouse models. Importantly, data from our group indicate that these cellular phenotypes
contribute to SCLC development. The specific goal of this proposal is to elucidate how different cellular
subpopulations within SCLC tumors drive early SCLC development, dynamics, and growth and to leverage this
mechanistic information to identify biomarkers for early detection and prevention of SCLC.
 We have previously identified tumor-propagating cells (TPCs) in SCLC tumors and found that these cells
are neuroendocrine and strongly tumorigenic. We have also characterized cell populations derived from these
TPCs with distinct phenotypes, including non-neuroendocrine NOTCH+ and CD44+ subpopulations, that
promote the growth and survival of the neuroendocrine TPCs. Leveraging these findings as well as our unique
genetic mouse models that allow dissection of SCLC phenotype evolution, we will investigate how cell-cell
interactions of these distinct SCLC cell phenotypes contribute to tumor development and growth, in relationship
with the tumor microenvironment. We will also elucidate the role of secretory factors released by these SCLC
subpopulations in driving survival, growth, and phenotype composition of SCLC tumors. Finally, we will
perform analysis of cfDNA and proteins (including on exosomes) present in SCLC patient plasma for
identification of related markers of SCLC development and early detection. We will also follow up on intriguing
findings that germline mutations in NOTCH are present in a large fraction of SCLC patients, suggesting a
potential risk marker beyond smoking.
 This interdisciplinary basic-translational project will elucidate fundamental mechanisms of SCLC
development and may lead to novel methods for early detection and/or prevention of SCLC."

5U01CA231851-03	U01CA231851	9996543	2020	Molecular mechanisms of SCLC initiation and detection in mice and humans	"Small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) is one of the deadliest cancers, a “recalcitrant” cancer for which there
is no effective treatment except when the disease is diagnosed early. However, only a small fraction of patients
are diagnosed early in disease. The greatest challenge to early diagnosis is that SCLC tumor cells typically
acquire an exceptional mutation burden and metastasize early, so for most patients disease has spread
beyond the lung at the time of diagnosis. The key to developing effective early diagnosis and treatment
methods is to elucidate the earliest molecular and cellular events of tumor initiation to uncover ones that can
be detected by screening during the premalignant phase of the disease. The goal of this proposal is to define
the early, premalignant molecular and cellular events of SCLC, so that they can be detected early and
destroyed before they become a deadly, untreatable disease.
 SCLC is a neuroendocrine cancer. The prominent cell of origin is pulmonary neuroendocrine (NE) cells,
neurosensory and neurosecretory epithelial cells that sense and respond to the environment in the lung.
Recently, a minor subpopulation of NE cells was found to have stem cell activity, proliferating, dispersing, and
replenishing the surrounding bronchial epithelium following severe airway injury. Loss of tumor suppressors Rb
and p53 constitutively activates the stem cell program within days of loss of the tumor suppressors, even in the
absence of injury. In this proposal, a combination of genetics, cell culture, and single-cell genomics is used to
systematically interrogate these stem cells at cellular resolution, both in healthy lungs and in the early,
premalignant stage of SCLC. The goal is to define the molecular events immediately following loss of Rb and
p53 that constitutively activate the stem cell program and initiate their transformation into cancer stem cells that
spread, mutate, and escape immune destruction, and to identify the signals they secrete that might allow the
tumors to be detected before they become deadly."

 Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an especially virulent form of lung cancer that is
only transiently responsive to therapy and kills about 30,000 Americans each year.
Based on a more general interest in understanding why certain kinds of cancers have
characteristic genotypes, we are developing methods for studying the initiation of human
cancers by genetically modifying cells at discrete stages of differentiation after chemical
induction of specific lineages from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). We have
extended recently published methods for inducing hESCs to form parts of the pulmonary
lineage by perturbing NOTCH signaling and reducing expression of the RB1 gene (one of
the two genes commonly inactivated in SCLC); in this way, we have prepared cultures
with high proportions of pulmonary neuroendocrine cells (PNECs), the putative
precursors of SCLC. Moreover, by also reducing expression of P53, the other gene
commonly inactivated in SCLC, PNEC-containing cultures are able to produce small
tumors resembling SCLC when implanted in immune-deficient mice.
 We now propose to expand our studies of this promising model for studying the
origins of SCLC in several ways: by determining the mechanisms by which interference
with NOTCH and RB1 generates PNECs; by exploring several possible assays for the
SCLC-like phenotype we have recently observed; by defining the similarities between the
genetic and physiological features of the SCLCs derived from hESCs and the SCLCs
arising in human patients; and by making induced pleuropotent stem cells (iPSCs) from
normal and tumor cells from patients with lung cancer, especially SCLC, in an effort to
seek genetic risk factors for SCLC. Through these studies, we expect to generate new
information and ideas about risk assessment, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment for
SCLC.

5U01CA224293-03	U01CA224293	9988380	2020	Targeting BCAT1 and branched-chain amino acid metabolism for the detection and prevention of SCLC	"Summary
The high mortality of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is largely due to its invariable resistance to current
cytotoxic therapies. Chemoprevention has been considered as an alternative to existing therapeutics on the
basis of long tumor latency and the well-defined high-risk population (e.g. smokers). Identification of tractable
targets for prevention and early detection requires an understanding of molecular changes underlying early-
stage tumor development. We found that enhanced ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis are critical for
MYC family-driven transformation of precancerous precursors (preSC) into fully tumorigenic cells. Both human
and mouse SCLC cells are extremely sensitive to a specific inhibitor of ribosome biogenesis that has also been
shown to reduce tumor growth in a genetically engineered mouse model. Analysis of the MYC-driven
oncogenic gene signature revealed branched-chain aminotransferase 1 (BCAT1) as a potential modulator of
both metabolic adaptation and related stress response to promote cellular homeostasis. BCAT1 is an enzyme
that catalyzes transfer of the α-amino nitrogen from branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs including leucine) to
α-ketoglutarate to produce branched-chain α-keto acids (BCKAs) and glutamate. This enzyme routes BCAAs
into multiple metabolite pools for biosynthesis and regulates levels of BCAAs, specifically leucine, that
stimulate protein synthesis by acting as indicators of nutrient availability. BCAT1 has recently been implicated
in multiple types of cancers, including glioblastoma and mouse Kras/p53-driven lung adenocarcinoma. In this
application, we will test the hypotheses that enhanced BCAT1 promotes SCLC development by controlling
protein synthesis and stress response, and that altered levels of BCAA metabolites inform early BCAT1-
dependent SCLC development. To test these hypotheses, we propose the following Aims. Aim 1: To determine
the necessity of BCAT1 for SCLC development, we will evaluate the tumor suppressive effects of knocking out
Bcat1 and examine the effects of pharmacological inhibition of BCAT1 on SCLC development and long-term
survival in vivo. Aim 2: To determine the role of BCAT1 in protein synthesis and stress response during SCLC
development, we will manipulate BCAT1 and determine the resulting impact on biochemical interactions
among related proteins and pathways that influence proliferation and survival of L-Myc-induced transforming
cells, a model of early stage SCLC. We will also determine the significance of BCAA metabolism in tumor
development in vivo by setting up variable conditions that mimic different outcomes of the metabolic reaction
using a BCAA-defined diet. Aim 3: To test alterations in BCAA metabolites as biomarkers for BCAT1-
dependent SCLC development, we will monitor changes in plasma BCAA and BCKA levels during SCLC
development in vivo and examine the clinical correlation of plasma levels of these metabolites with a SCLC
diagnosis. The expected outcome of this proposal will provide critical insights into novel strategies for targeted
prevention using minimally invasive detection methods and intervention using low-toxicity drugs or nutrition."

5U01CA213285-03	U01CA213285	9762873	2019	Development of Risk and Early Detection Biomarker for Small Cell Lung Cancer	"ABSTRACT
The goal of this proposal by a multi-disciplinary team at MD Anderson Cancer Center, the
University of Texas Southwestern Cancer Center and the University of Pittsburg Cancer Center
is to explore approaches based on circulating protein markers and autoantibodies to develop a
blood based marker panel to assess risk of harboring or developing small cell lung cancer
(SCLC). There are currently several established SCLC protein markers which individually lack
sufficient performance for early detection. Additionally, the applicant group has uncovered
several protein marker candidates through integrated analyses of mouse models and human
SCLC samples. To assess the potential of established and newly discovered candidate markers
to yield a combined panel of markers indicative of risk of harboring or developing SCLC,
validation studies will be conducted using plasma samples collected up to 5 years prior to a
diagnosis of SCLC, from participants in the large European Prospective Investigation into
Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) and the Singapore Chinese Health Study (SCHS) cohorts.
Additonally, plasmas collected at the time of diagnosis of SCLC and post-treatment as well as
tissue molecular profiles will be interrogated to establish the biological relevance to candidates
to SCLC. Two approaches will be implemented to identify antigenic proteins and peptides that
induce autoantibodies that can be mined for SCLC early detection. One consisting of Ig bound
proteins in plasmas from SCLC cases and another novel approach consists of interrogating
whole genome derived peptide arrays for reactivity with aliquots of SCLC plasmas utilized for
validation of circulating proteins. The resulting combination of the most promising markers will
be further validated using pre-diagnostic SCLC samples and matched controls from the US

5U01CA224293-02	U01CA224293	9781672	2019	Targeting BCAT1 and branched-chain amino acid metabolism for the detection and prevention of SCLC	"Summary
The high mortality of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is largely due to its invariable resistance to current
cytotoxic therapies. Chemoprevention has been considered as an alternative to existing therapeutics on the
basis of long tumor latency and the well-defined high-risk population (e.g. smokers). Identification of tractable
targets for prevention and early detection requires an understanding of molecular changes underlying early-
stage tumor development. We found that enhanced ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis are critical for
MYC family-driven transformation of precancerous precursors (preSC) into fully tumorigenic cells. Both human
and mouse SCLC cells are extremely sensitive to a specific inhibitor of ribosome biogenesis that has also been
shown to reduce tumor growth in a genetically engineered mouse model. Analysis of the MYC-driven
oncogenic gene signature revealed branched-chain aminotransferase 1 (BCAT1) as a potential modulator of
both metabolic adaptation and related stress response to promote cellular homeostasis. BCAT1 is an enzyme
that catalyzes transfer of the α-amino nitrogen from branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs including leucine) to
α-ketoglutarate to produce branched-chain α-keto acids (BCKAs) and glutamate. This enzyme routes BCAAs
into multiple metabolite pools for biosynthesis and regulates levels of BCAAs, specifically leucine, that
stimulate protein synthesis by acting as indicators of nutrient availability. BCAT1 has recently been implicated
in multiple types of cancers, including glioblastoma and mouse Kras/p53-driven lung adenocarcinoma. In this
application, we will test the hypotheses that enhanced BCAT1 promotes SCLC development by controlling
protein synthesis and stress response, and that altered levels of BCAA metabolites inform early BCAT1-
dependent SCLC development. To test these hypotheses, we propose the following Aims. Aim 1: To determine
the necessity of BCAT1 for SCLC development, we will evaluate the tumor suppressive effects of knocking out
Bcat1 and examine the effects of pharmacological inhibition of BCAT1 on SCLC development and long-term
survival in vivo. Aim 2: To determine the role of BCAT1 in protein synthesis and stress response during SCLC
development, we will manipulate BCAT1 and determine the resulting impact on biochemical interactions
among related proteins and pathways that influence proliferation and survival of L-Myc-induced transforming
cells, a model of early stage SCLC. We will also determine the significance of BCAA metabolism in tumor
development in vivo by setting up variable conditions that mimic different outcomes of the metabolic reaction
using a BCAA-defined diet. Aim 3: To test alterations in BCAA metabolites as biomarkers for BCAT1-
dependent SCLC development, we will monitor changes in plasma BCAA and BCKA levels during SCLC
development in vivo and examine the clinical correlation of plasma levels of these metabolites with a SCLC
diagnosis. The expected outcome of this proposal will provide critical insights into novel strategies for targeted
prevention using minimally invasive detection methods and intervention using low-toxicity drugs or nutrition."

 Small Cell Lung Carcinoma (SCLC) is an aggressive neuroendocrine subtype of lung cancer. SCLC
patients have a very low 5-year survival, in part because SCLC tumors are often detected at a late stage when
the tumors have already metastasized and treatment outcomes are worse. Thus, early detection becomes
critical to achieve better treatment results. Emerging evidence supports the idea that, while SCLC tumors seem
homogeneous when examined under a microscope, these tumors contain a significant level of intra-tumoral
heterogeneity. Indeed, recent observations by our group and others have identified distinct cellular phenotypes
in SCLC, including in primary human tumors, in cell lines derived from human tumors, and in tumors from
genetically-engineered mouse models. Importantly, data from our group indicate that these cellular phenotypes
contribute to SCLC development. The specific goal of this proposal is to elucidate how different cellular
subpopulations within SCLC tumors drive early SCLC development, dynamics, and growth and to leverage this
mechanistic information to identify biomarkers for early detection and prevention of SCLC.
 We have previously identified tumor-propagating cells (TPCs) in SCLC tumors and found that these cells
are neuroendocrine and strongly tumorigenic. We have also characterized cell populations derived from these
TPCs with distinct phenotypes, including non-neuroendocrine NOTCH+ and CD44+ subpopulations, that
promote the growth and survival of the neuroendocrine TPCs. Leveraging these findings as well as our unique
genetic mouse models that allow dissection of SCLC phenotype evolution, we will investigate how cell-cell
interactions of these distinct SCLC cell phenotypes contribute to tumor development and growth, in relationship
with the tumor microenvironment. We will also elucidate the role of secretory factors released by these SCLC
subpopulations in driving survival, growth, and phenotype composition of SCLC tumors. Finally, we will
perform analysis of cfDNA and proteins (including on exosomes) present in SCLC patient plasma for
identification of related markers of SCLC development and early detection. We will also follow up on intriguing
findings that germline mutations in NOTCH are present in a large fraction of SCLC patients, suggesting a
potential risk marker beyond smoking.
 This interdisciplinary basic-translational project will elucidate fundamental mechanisms of SCLC
development and may lead to novel methods for early detection and/or prevention of SCLC."

1U01CA231851-01	U01CA231851	9602535	2018	Molecular mechanisms of SCLC initiation and detection in mice and humans	"Small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) is one of the deadliest cancers, a “recalcitrant” cancer for which there
is no effective treatment except when the disease is diagnosed early. However, only a small fraction of patients
are diagnosed early in disease. The greatest challenge to early diagnosis is that SCLC tumor cells typically
acquire an exceptional mutation burden and metastasize early, so for most patients disease has spread
beyond the lung at the time of diagnosis. The key to developing effective early diagnosis and treatment
methods is to elucidate the earliest molecular and cellular events of tumor initiation to uncover ones that can
be detected by screening during the premalignant phase of the disease. The goal of this proposal is to define
the early, premalignant molecular and cellular events of SCLC, so that they can be detected early and
destroyed before they become a deadly, untreatable disease.
 SCLC is a neuroendocrine cancer. The prominent cell of origin is pulmonary neuroendocrine (NE) cells,
neurosensory and neurosecretory epithelial cells that sense and respond to the environment in the lung.
Recently, a minor subpopulation of NE cells was found to have stem cell activity, proliferating, dispersing, and
replenishing the surrounding bronchial epithelium following severe airway injury. Loss of tumor suppressors Rb
and p53 constitutively activates the stem cell program within days of loss of the tumor suppressors, even in the
absence of injury. In this proposal, a combination of genetics, cell culture, and single-cell genomics is used to
systematically interrogate these stem cells at cellular resolution, both in healthy lungs and in the early,
premalignant stage of SCLC. The goal is to define the molecular events immediately following loss of Rb and
p53 that constitutively activate the stem cell program and initiate their transformation into cancer stem cells that
spread, mutate, and escape immune destruction, and to identify the signals they secrete that might allow the
tumors to be detected before they become deadly."

 Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an especially virulent form of lung cancer that is
only transiently responsive to therapy and kills about 30,000 Americans each year.
Based on a more general interest in understanding why certain kinds of cancers have
characteristic genotypes, we are developing methods for studying the initiation of human
cancers by genetically modifying cells at discrete stages of differentiation after chemical
induction of specific lineages from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). We have
extended recently published methods for inducing hESCs to form parts of the pulmonary
lineage by perturbing NOTCH signaling and reducing expression of the RB1 gene (one of
the two genes commonly inactivated in SCLC); in this way, we have prepared cultures
with high proportions of pulmonary neuroendocrine cells (PNECs), the putative
precursors of SCLC. Moreover, by also reducing expression of P53, the other gene
commonly inactivated in SCLC, PNEC-containing cultures are able to produce small
tumors resembling SCLC when implanted in immune-deficient mice.
 We now propose to expand our studies of this promising model for studying the
origins of SCLC in several ways: by determining the mechanisms by which interference
with NOTCH and RB1 generates PNECs; by exploring several possible assays for the
SCLC-like phenotype we have recently observed; by defining the similarities between the
genetic and physiological features of the SCLCs derived from hESCs and the SCLCs
arising in human patients; and by making induced pleuropotent stem cells (iPSCs) from
normal and tumor cells from patients with lung cancer, especially SCLC, in an effort to
seek genetic risk factors for SCLC. Through these studies, we expect to generate new
information and ideas about risk assessment, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment for
SCLC.

The goal of this proposal by a multi-disciplinary team at MD Anderson Cancer Center, the
University of Texas Southwestern Cancer Center and the University of Pittsburg Cancer Center
is to explore approaches based on circulating protein markers and autoantibodies to develop a
blood based marker panel to assess risk of harboring or developing small cell lung cancer
(SCLC). There are currently several established SCLC protein markers which individually lack
sufficient performance for early detection. Additionally, the applicant group has uncovered
several protein marker candidates through integrated analyses of mouse models and human

The goal of this proposal by a multi-disciplinary team at MD Anderson Cancer Center, the
University of Texas Southwestern Cancer Center and the University of Pittsburg Cancer Center
is to explore approaches based on circulating protein markers and autoantibodies to develop a
blood based marker panel to assess risk of harboring or developing small cell lung cancer
(SCLC). There are currently several established SCLC protein markers which individually lack
sufficient performance for early detection. Additionally, the applicant group has uncovered
several protein marker candidates through integrated analyses of mouse models and human
SCLC samples. To assess the potential of established and newly discovered candidate markers
to yield a combined panel of markers indicative of risk of harboring or developing SCLC,
validation studies will be conducted using plasma samples collected up to 5 years prior to a

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. While the implementation of lung cancer
screening for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) subtypes has brought significant hope to this disease, very
limited options exist for the early detection of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) SCLC carries a 5-year survival rate
of only 7% and despite the development of novel targeted therapies and early detection for NSCLC, no such
advances have been achieved in SCLC. A gap in our current approach to lung cancer detection and treatment
has been that informative and reliable biomarkers for the detection and surveillance of lung cancer have
remained elusive. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as viable biomarkers in body fluids thus, providing an
excellent means to achieve non-invasive assays for early cancer detection. Furthermore, miRNA expression in
circulation appears to be compartment specific. While the majority of miRNAs are intracellular, a significant
number of miRNAs have been observed outside of cells, including in various bodily fluids. The origin,
applications and potential functionality of RNAs in circulation are the sources of intriguing questions. Obtaining
a detailed RNA spectrum in plasma would shed some light on this matter. We have taken a multidisciplinary
approach to the investigation of circulating RNA transcripts that integrates expertise in miRNA biology,
nanoengineering, lung cancer and bioinformatics. We have developed a simple tethered Cationic Lipoplex
Nanoparticle (tCLN) biochip with pre-loaded molecular beacons (MBs) in the lipoplex nanoparticles as probes
to capture and detect targeted miRNAs and mRNAs in human plasma without any need of pre- or post-sample
treatment. We have successfully demonstrated the ability to assess both exosomal miRNAs and mRNAs using
both Next Generation Sequencing and our tCLN biochip in cohorts of control smokers and patients with early
stage NSCLC. Our primary objectives are to extend these novel findings by (1) Test and validate the utility of
measurement of ASCL1 and DLL3 in the early detection of SCLC in a retrospective and prospective study with
network samples (2) Develop A Panel of Comprehensive EV RNA Candidates using nest generation
sequencing and q-RT-PCR (3) Develop an optimized EV nanochip based RNA Classifier for early SCLC
detection and (4) Validate the optimized EV RNA Classifier by using the multiplex TLN array biochips in
independent, blinded case control studies at the OSU James Cancer Hospital and from the SCLC consortium."

5U01CA256801-03	U01CA256801	10380107	2023	Optimizing Dual-Targeted and Dual-Armored CAR T Cells for Small Cell LungCancer	"ABSTRACT
A patient's own T cells can be modified using gene therapy technology to express receptors, termed chimeric
antigen receptors or CARs, which allow these immune T cells to recognize proteins on the tumor cell surface,
and in turn allow these CAR modified T cells to recognize and kill the patient's own tumor cells. This approach
has been successful in some hematological malignancies, however, it has not been successful to date in solid
tumors including small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Two mechanisms by which SCLC may evade T cell-mediated
killing are loss of expression of antigens, and suppression of T cell function in the tumor microenvironment. In
this proposal, we will attempt to overcome these barriers by designing CAR T cells that target two SCLC antigens
simultaneously, and that produce multiple factors (“armors”) that enhance T cell activity in solid tumors. We
hypothesize that these dual-armored, dual targeted (DADT) CAR T cells will be more effective against SCLC
than previous T cell-mediated and immune therapies. We have previously shown that CAR T cells targeted to
either the antigen GD3 or to the antigen DLL3, both of which are expressed on the majority of small cell lung
cancers, are capable of killing SCLC cells in preclinical systems. Additionally, we have developed multiple
armored CAR T cells that secrete factors such as IL-18, or an antibody-derived single-chain variable fragment
(scFv) that blocks the immune checkpoint receptor PD-1, or an scFv blocking the phagocytosis-inhibitory signal
CD47 on tumor cells. All of these armors enhance CAR T cell activity in our in vivo model systems through
different mechanisms. In Aim 1 of this proposal, we will generate CAR T cells targeting DLL3 and GD3
simultaneously, to overcome antigen heterogeneity and antigen loss in tumors as a means of escape from T
cell-mediated killing. Simultaneously, in Aim 2, we will test pairs of armors to identify the pair that is the most
effective at enhancing the activity of single antigen-targeted CAR T cells against SCLC in vivo in
immunocompetent systems. We then analyze the immune cells in the SCLC tumor microenvironment following
CAR T cell treatment to assess changes mediated by the armored CAR T cells. Ultimately, in Aim 3, we will
combine these approaches to generate CAR T cells that recognize GD3 and DLL3 and produce multiple armors.
These DADT CAR T cells for SCLC may be suitable for further preclinical testing in preparation for clinical trials
beyond the scope of this proposal, representing a novel therapeutic approach to SCLC. Given our robust track
record in CAR T cell clinical translation, we fully anticipate having new CAR T cells suitable for clinical trials at
the conclusion of funding. Additionally, these novel CAR T cells may be used as tools to explore the interactions
between T cells and the SCLC microenvironment. The analysis of changes in SCLC tumors induced by the
armored CAR T cells proposed here may reveal novel aspects of SCLC biology and illuminate mechanisms of
immune escape and treatment failure in SCLC."

5U01CA256780-03	U01CA256780	10643991	2023	Molecular and immunological heterogeneity of Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC) and its impact on relapse and therapeutic response	"PROJECT SUMMARY
Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive malignancy for which there is a critical need for improved
therapeutic strategies. While targeted and immune-based therapies have demonstrated encouraging results
recently, they have shown benefit in only a subset of patients and, thus, have yielded little to no impact on the
survival of unselected populations and even these benefits are limited by the rapid onset of resistance. There
are currently no standard markers for selecting treatment or evaluating therapeutic resistance, issues made more
challenging by the dearth of available tissue for molecular assessment in SCLC. Recent evidence from our group
and others suggests that SCLC is a molecularly diverse disease and can be divided into four subtypes largely
defined by the differential expression of three transcription factors [ASCL1 (SCLC-A), NEUROD1 (SCLC-N), and
POU2F3 (SCLC-P)], and a fourth subtype with high expression of inflammatory and mesenchymal markers
[Inflamed, (SCLC-I)]. Each subtype is characterized, in vitro, by distinct therapeutic vulnerabilities. Moreover, we
showed that genomic and immune intra-tumoral heterogeneity (ITH) portends poorer survival, while increasing
transcriptional ITH may be associated with therapeutic resistance in SCLC. The overarching goal of this proposal
is to systematically investigate heterogeneity in SCLC and its association with therapeutic response, and develop
tools to evaluate these features in the clinic. More specifically, we hypothesize (1) That SCLC is heterogeneous
and can be divided into major subgroups with distinct therapeutic vulnerabilities; and (2) That greater ITH-
assessed either at the genomic, immune, or transcriptional level- is associated with therapeutic resistance in
SCLC and can be assessed dynamically during treatment in a non-invasive manner using blood-based
biomarkers. To address these hypotheses, in Aim 1, we will assess whether these four molecular subtypes can
serve as predictive biomarkers in co-clinical trials in vivo and in retrospective patient tissue analyses, while also
developing blood-based strategies to identify the subtypes. In Aim 2, we will assess ITH at multiple molecular
levels, including genomic, transcriptomic, methylomic, and immunologic, to characterize how baseline ITH
influences patient survival. Lastly, in Aim 3, we will assess dynamic changes in transcriptional ITH following
treatment, using paired samples from in vivo models and patient samples, to determine if increasing ITH of
molecular subtype drives resistance and whether epigenetic modification may prevent or reverse it. The overall
hypothesis tested here is that careful initial molecular subtyping of SCLC tumors, paired with strategies aimed
at assessing, then limiting/reversing ITH, may better optimize the rate and duration of response to therapy. The
studies will be facilitated by a comprehensive library of patient-derived murine models and extensive clinical data
sets and executed by a multidisciplinary team of clinical/laboratory investigators, pathologists, computational
biologists, and others with a strong track record of innovation in SCLC and translating laboratory findings into
the clinic."

Small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) is one of the most intractable human cancers to cure. It is an aggressive tumor
characterized by rapid growth, metastatic progression, and initial response followed by almost invariable
resistance to therapy. Studies to date have not resolved the extent that diverse genetic and epigenetic programs
drive SCLC and contribute to its lethality. We combined one of the largest and most diverse inventories of
patient-derived xenograft models of SCLC globally with an ex vivo culture system that maintains
transcriptional fidelity with matched primary SCLC tumor to identify distinct and dynamic phenotypic states that
differ in functional attributes within individual tumors. We show that human SCLC tumors display distinctive
equilibria in the proportion of cells in various phenotypic (not merely transcriptional) states. We also show that
SCLC states are highly regulated by multivalent cellular plasticity and we measure the kinetics of this plasticity
at the single cell level. Importantly, standard of care chemotherapies in this disease preferentially kill specific
cancer cell states. In this proposal, we posit that understanding the facets of SCLC's intratumoral heterogeneity
will: 1) contribute to our understanding of a poorly characterized aspect of cancer heterogeneity; 2) reveal how
stochasticity and/or ecological cues in single-cell behaviors promote phenotypic equilibrium in cancer
populations; 3) provide insight into the biological and clinical behavior of SCLC; and 4) advance desperately
needed new therapeutic strategies of epigenetic reprogramming in this recalcitrant disease. Our team of
investigators have content expertise in several computational, experimental, and translational methods pertinent
to this proposal including human-derived in vivo and ex vivo model systems, single-cell RNA sequencing, bulk
genetic and expression analysis, single cell fluorescence tracking, and mathematical and statistical modeling.
Our integrative approach is poised to formulate and validate a unified model of cellular states and program
diversity in SCLC. If successful, the characterization of malignant cell ontogenic programs (SA1), their plasticity
(SA2), and the advancement of new therapies designed to combat plasticity by epigenetic reprogramming (SA3)
will advance a unique scientific canvas for the study of this highly lethal disease."

1U01CA268066-01A1	U01CA268066	10525710	2022	Translating Autoantibodies Into Chimeric Antigen Receptor-T cell Therapy for Small Cell Lung Cancer	"Abstract
For the last 30 years, the 5-year survival rate of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) has been less than 7% despite
the addition of immune checkpoint inhibitors as treatment options. Therapies like immune checkpoint inhibitors
that aim to reengage an immune response may not succeed for SCLC as previous studies have shown
downregulation of MHC molecules, low PD-L1 expression and limited immune infiltration. However, SCLC is
often associated with autoantibody-driven Paraneoplastic Syndromes, providing evidence for the
immunogenicity of SCLC. We propose that chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-Ts) as a novel approach for
SCLC immunotherapy that overcomes impediments to endogenous immunity. CAR-Ts are synthetically
engineered to fuse antibody ligand binding domains with costimulatory components that activate T cells after
engagement of cell surface antigens, and have had considerable success in leukemia, lymphoma, and multiple
myeloma. The microenvironment of SCLC is phenotypically closer to CAR-T responsive lymphoma than many
solid tumors where CAR-Ts have thus far had limited success. A challenge for CAR-T cells in many solid tumors
is the identification of target antigens that are tumor-specific. We have identified 13 novel cell surface antigen
and here will prioritize 3 with high prevalence in SCLC. Each of these antigens have post-translational
modifications that act as neoantigens and lead to autoantibody production in a high percentage of SCLC cases.
We will capture these neoantigen-autoantibodies from SCLC patient-derived B cells, sequence the tumor specific
binding sequences, and design and test CARs constructed from the single chain variable fragments (scFvs).
The benefit of isolating autoantibodies from SCLC patients to detect tumor-specific neoantigens is three-fold: 1.
The antigens identified have already proven to be immunogenic; 2. The variable regions of these human
autoantibodies can be directly engineered into ligand binding domains of CAR-T cells; and 3. Autoantibodies
can be detected in the blood of patients and serve as tissue surrogate biomarkers to guide CAR-T cell target
selection. The CAR-T cells we develop will be rigorously tested in multiple preclinical models that address
complementary but non-overlapping therapeutic barriers. These include testing CAR-T cell tumor infiltration,
efficacy and toxicity in a library of genetically diverse SCLC patient derived xenografts and identifying, then
overcoming, immunosuppressive mechanisms in the immune competent Rb/p53 genetically engineered mouse
model. Our team of experts in lung cancer, autoantibody biomarkers, immunology and CAR-T cells is well
equipped to execute the development of novel immunotherapies that are desperately needed in SCLC."

5U01CA253383-03	U01CA253383	10466892	2022	Understanding the molecular mechanism of a protein-recycling complex in small cell lung cancer treatment resistance.	"PROJECT SUMMARY
Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) patients have an initial robust response to combinations of DNA damaging
agents (e.g. cisplatin, etoposide, radiotherapy), however, many patients inevitably suffer from relapse and
resistant disease. A clear understanding of these resistance mechanisms remains elusive. Consequently,
there is a critical need to: (1) understand the mechanisms of therapeutic resistance and (2) develop novel
therapeutics.
Poly-(ADP)-ribose polymerase enzymes (PARP) protein levels are upregulated in SCLC relative to other lung
cancers, and initial studies suggest that this upregulation is associated with increased sensitivity of SCLC to
PARP inhibitors (PARPi) in vitro. PARP inhibitors are synthetic lethal with BRCA1/2 mutated homologous
recombination (HR) deficient tumors and restoration of HR by BRCA reversion mutations is a known
mechanism of PARPi and cisplatin resistance. However, as BRCA1/2 mutations are exceedingly rare in
SCLC non-BRCA mechanisms must be operant.
We performed a genome-wide CRISPR knockout screen to identify novel mechanisms of PARPi resistance.
From subsequent functional validation and clinical genomic correlation, we identified deficiency in an F-box
protein coding gene as a putative biomarker of resistance to PARP inhibitors and cisplatin in SCLC that may
be present in up to ~20% of relapse patient tumors. Loss of this F-box protein abrogates the function of its
corresponding SKP1, CUL1, F-box (SCF) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. By proximity-dependent biotin
identification (BioID) of this F-box protein, we have identified a high confidence interactor with substrate-like
behavior for SCF-mediated ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation that is important for regulation of HR and DNA
repair.
This proposal aims to: (1) determine the mechanism of this specific SCF complex with its substrate to engage
the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway; (2) elucidate the impact of this F-box protein on HR, DNA repair, and
therapeutic sensitivity to PARPi/cisplatin; and (3) identify synthetic lethal interactions with deficiencies in this

5U01CA256780-02	U01CA256780	10415041	2022	Molecular and immunological heterogeneity of Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC) and its impact on relapse and therapeutic response	"PROJECT SUMMARY
Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive malignancy for which there is a critical need for improved
therapeutic strategies. While targeted and immune-based therapies have demonstrated encouraging results
recently, they have shown benefit in only a subset of patients and, thus, have yielded little to no impact on the
survival of unselected populations and even these benefits are limited by the rapid onset of resistance. There
are currently no standard markers for selecting treatment or evaluating therapeutic resistance, issues made more
challenging by the dearth of available tissue for molecular assessment in SCLC. Recent evidence from our group
and others suggests that SCLC is a molecularly diverse disease and can be divided into four subtypes largely
defined by the differential expression of three transcription factors [ASCL1 (SCLC-A), NEUROD1 (SCLC-N), and
POU2F3 (SCLC-P)], and a fourth subtype with high expression of inflammatory and mesenchymal markers
[Inflamed, (SCLC-I)]. Each subtype is characterized, in vitro, by distinct therapeutic vulnerabilities. Moreover, we
showed that genomic and immune intra-tumoral heterogeneity (ITH) portends poorer survival, while increasing
transcriptional ITH may be associated with therapeutic resistance in SCLC. The overarching goal of this proposal
is to systematically investigate heterogeneity in SCLC and its association with therapeutic response, and develop
tools to evaluate these features in the clinic. More specifically, we hypothesize (1) That SCLC is heterogeneous
and can be divided into major subgroups with distinct therapeutic vulnerabilities; and (2) That greater ITH-
assessed either at the genomic, immune, or transcriptional level- is associated with therapeutic resistance in
SCLC and can be assessed dynamically during treatment in a non-invasive manner using blood-based
biomarkers. To address these hypotheses, in Aim 1, we will assess whether these four molecular subtypes can
serve as predictive biomarkers in co-clinical trials in vivo and in retrospective patient tissue analyses, while also
developing blood-based strategies to identify the subtypes. In Aim 2, we will assess ITH at multiple molecular
levels, including genomic, transcriptomic, methylomic, and immunologic, to characterize how baseline ITH
influences patient survival. Lastly, in Aim 3, we will assess dynamic changes in transcriptional ITH following
treatment, using paired samples from in vivo models and patient samples, to determine if increasing ITH of
molecular subtype drives resistance and whether epigenetic modification may prevent or reverse it. The overall
hypothesis tested here is that careful initial molecular subtyping of SCLC tumors, paired with strategies aimed
at assessing, then limiting/reversing ITH, may better optimize the rate and duration of response to therapy. The
studies will be facilitated by a comprehensive library of patient-derived murine models and extensive clinical data
sets and executed by a multidisciplinary team of clinical/laboratory investigators, pathologists, computational
biologists, and others with a strong track record of innovation in SCLC and translating laboratory findings into
the clinic."

1U01CA256801-01	U01CA256801	10126626	2021	Optimizing Dual-Targeted and Dual-Armored CAR T Cells for Small Cell Lung Cancer	"ABSTRACT
A patient's own T cells can be modified using gene therapy technology to express receptors, termed chimeric
antigen receptors or CARs, which allow these immune T cells to recognize proteins on the tumor cell surface,
and in turn allow these CAR modified T cells to recognize and kill the patient's own tumor cells. This approach
has been successful in some hematological malignancies, however, it has not been successful to date in solid
tumors including small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Two mechanisms by which SCLC may evade T cell-mediated
killing are loss of expression of antigens, and suppression of T cell function in the tumor microenvironment. In
this proposal, we will attempt to overcome these barriers by designing CAR T cells that target two SCLC antigens
simultaneously, and that produce multiple factors (“armors”) that enhance T cell activity in solid tumors. We
hypothesize that these dual-armored, dual targeted (DADT) CAR T cells will be more effective against SCLC
than previous T cell-mediated and immune therapies. We have previously shown that CAR T cells targeted to
either the antigen GD3 or to the antigen DLL3, both of which are expressed on the majority of small cell lung
cancers, are capable of killing SCLC cells in preclinical systems. Additionally, we have developed multiple
armored CAR T cells that secrete factors such as IL-18, or an antibody-derived single-chain variable fragment
(scFv) that blocks the immune checkpoint receptor PD-1, or an scFv blocking the phagocytosis-inhibitory signal
CD47 on tumor cells. All of these armors enhance CAR T cell activity in our in vivo model systems through
different mechanisms. In Aim 1 of this proposal, we will generate CAR T cells targeting DLL3 and GD3
simultaneously, to overcome antigen heterogeneity and antigen loss in tumors as a means of escape from T
cell-mediated killing. Simultaneously, in Aim 2, we will test pairs of armors to identify the pair that is the most
effective at enhancing the activity of single antigen-targeted CAR T cells against SCLC in vivo in
immunocompetent systems. We then analyze the immune cells in the SCLC tumor microenvironment following
CAR T cell treatment to assess changes mediated by the armored CAR T cells. Ultimately, in Aim 3, we will
combine these approaches to generate CAR T cells that recognize GD3 and DLL3 and produce multiple armors.
These DADT CAR T cells for SCLC may be suitable for further preclinical testing in preparation for clinical trials
beyond the scope of this proposal, representing a novel therapeutic approach to SCLC. Given our robust track
record in CAR T cell clinical translation, we fully anticipate having new CAR T cells suitable for clinical trials at
the conclusion of funding. Additionally, these novel CAR T cells may be used as tools to explore the interactions
between T cells and the SCLC microenvironment. The analysis of changes in SCLC tumors induced by the
armored CAR T cells proposed here may reveal novel aspects of SCLC biology and illuminate mechanisms of
immune escape and treatment failure in SCLC."

5U01CA253383-02	U01CA253383	10271273	2021	Understanding the molecular mechanism of a protein-recycling complex in small cell lung cancer treatment resistance.	"PROJECT SUMMARY
Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) patients have an initial robust response to combinations of DNA damaging
agents (e.g. cisplatin, etoposide, radiotherapy), however, many patients inevitably suffer from relapse and
resistant disease. A clear understanding of these resistance mechanisms remains elusive. Consequently,
there is a critical need to: (1) understand the mechanisms of therapeutic resistance and (2) develop novel
therapeutics.
Poly-(ADP)-ribose polymerase enzymes (PARP) protein levels are upregulated in SCLC relative to other lung
cancers, and initial studies suggest that this upregulation is associated with increased sensitivity of SCLC to
PARP inhibitors (PARPi) in vitro. PARP inhibitors are synthetic lethal with BRCA1/2 mutated homologous
recombination (HR) deficient tumors and restoration of HR by BRCA reversion mutations is a known
mechanism of PARPi and cisplatin resistance. However, as BRCA1/2 mutations are exceedingly rare in
SCLC non-BRCA mechanisms must be operant.
We performed a genome-wide CRISPR knockout screen to identify novel mechanisms of PARPi resistance.
From subsequent functional validation and clinical genomic correlation, we identified deficiency in an F-box
protein coding gene as a putative biomarker of resistance to PARP inhibitors and cisplatin in SCLC that may
be present in up to ~20% of relapse patient tumors. Loss of this F-box protein abrogates the function of its
corresponding SKP1, CUL1, F-box (SCF) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. By proximity-dependent biotin
identification (BioID) of this F-box protein, we have identified a high confidence interactor with substrate-like
behavior for SCF-mediated ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation that is important for regulation of HR and DNA
repair.
This proposal aims to: (1) determine the mechanism of this specific SCF complex with its substrate to engage
the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway; (2) elucidate the impact of this F-box protein on HR, DNA repair, and
therapeutic sensitivity to PARPi/cisplatin; and (3) identify synthetic lethal interactions with deficiencies in this
F-box protein to provide biologic insight and characterize immediately translatable approaches for relapsed
treatment resistant SCLC."
