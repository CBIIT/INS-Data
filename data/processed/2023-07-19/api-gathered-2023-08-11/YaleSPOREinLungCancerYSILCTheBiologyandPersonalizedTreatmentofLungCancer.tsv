5P50CA196530-08	P50CA196530	10479786	2022	Yale SPORE in Lung Cancer (YSILC): The Biology and Personalized Treatment of Lung Cancer	"YALE SPORE IN LUNG CANCER (YSILC) OVERALL SUMMARY
The Biology and Personalized Treatment of Primary and Metastatic Lung Cancer: The YSILC unites
translational scientists spanning diverse areas of cancer research to converge on addressing the challenge of
lung cancer. The goal of the YSILC is to reduce mortality from lung cancer through development of novel
therapeutics and treatment approaches that are based on an understanding of targetable biochemical and
immunological pathways involved in progression of lung cancer, acquisition of resistance, and development of
metastasis The YSILC translational research team will accomplish this objective through three projects:
Project 1: Test the hypotheses that Siglec-15 (S15) is a major immune suppressor in PD-L1/B7-H1-negative
lung cancer and that blockade of S15 can be efficacious for a subset of lung cancer patients; Project 2:
Evaluate mechanism-based approaches to counter tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance in EGFR-mutant lung
cancer; Project 3: Targeting lung cancer metastasis and drug resistance in the central nervous system. There
are three Cores (Administrative; Biostatistics and Bioinformatics; and Biospecimen, Pathology, and Genomics)
to support the projects and their clinical aims, mechanistic studies, and evaluation of biomarkers for clinical
application. Strong Developmental Research and Career Enhancement Programs (DRP, CEP) with a
history of choosing diverse and productive projects with good outcomes are also proposed. The highly
coordinated YSILC projects, cores, and programs are focused on developing novel lung cancer therapies, with
analysis of patient samples, cell-based assays, production of human cell lines and animal models of disease
as a guide to design prospective trials that translate these innovative targeted approaches to clinical therapies.
Each of these projects has a clinical trial (either investigator-initiated or NCI-based) designed to test the
sensitivity and resistance of the new therapy with molecular correlates. The expected translational outcomes of
the program include: (1) a highly coordinated and focused development of a novel immune agent discovered
during our current SPORE research; (2) an improved understanding of genetic and epigenetic mechanisms of
resistance to EGFR therapies and how to combat it; (3) an understanding of the mechanism underlying brain
metastasis; (4) expanding the breadth of lung cancer research by developing the next generation of
investigators and encouraging established investigators in other fields to pursue studies on lung cancer
through our CEP and DRP programs."

3P50CA196530-03S1	P50CA196530	9379210	2017	MicroRNA-based interventions to prevent progression from lung preneoplasia to adenocarcinoma	"PROJECT SUMMARY
This proposal titled “MicroRNA-based interventions to prevent progression from lung preneoplasia to
adenocarcinoma” is responsive to PQ1.
Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Despite advances in detection
and improvements to standard of care, the overall survival rate for lung cancer patients remains very low (5).
This poor survival rate is probably due to the relatively advanced stage of the disease at diagnosis. If lung
cancer could be identified and stopped at a preneoplastic stage prior to progression into advanced stage, we
could improve the patients' survival. However, little is known about the biomarkers distinguishing preneoplasia
from normal tissues and the molecules driving preneoplasia initiation and progression. Recent evidence has
shown that intratumor cellular heterogeneity contributes to tumor initiation and progression of cancer, including
lung cancer (6). Tumor-initiating cells (TICs) or cancer stem cells are a subpopulation of the bulk of tumor cells
that can recapitulate the whole tumor's heterogeneous structures and functionally drive tumorigenesis. Nuclear
factor-κB (NF-κB) is the key mediators of the inflammation response and has been recently been implicated as
a driver of TICs (7). More recently, it has been found that inflammation can change expression of some
microRNAs (miRNAs), including upregulation of oncogenic miR-21 (8). MiRNAs are non-coding RNAs
belonging to a novel class of regulatory molecules that control gene expression by binding to complementary
sites on multiple target messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts simultaneously (9). However, the signaling events
that link cancer stemness-related miRNAs to preneoplasia initiation and progression in inflammatory
microenvironments remain to be charted. We hypothesize that inflammation induced miRNA dysregulation on
TICs might drive preneoplasia initiation and progression in KRASmut or epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFRmut) lung adenocarcinoma patients, and that a deeper understanding of this may identify novel targets
for miRNA-based therapeutics. In Aim 1, we will characterize a miRNA signature in preneoplasia in lung
tissues. In Aim 2, we will investigate roles of miRNA inhibitors or mimics in preventing progression from
preneoplasia to neoplasia in lung. At the conclusion of these studies, we will have generated a new tumor
organoid model, developed miRNA therapeutics useful in curing preneoplasia and preventing malignant
progression, as well as gained innovative information regarding roles of both TICs and the inflammatory niche
in preneoplasia initiation and progression."

3P50CA196530-02S1	P50CA196530	9338869	2016	Yale SPORE in Lung Cancer (YSILC): The Biology and Personalized Treatment of Lung Cancer	DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The Yale SPORE in Lung Cancer (YSILC) coalesces translational scientists spanning all aspects of cancer research to converge on the lung cancer problem. The YSILC leverages existing Yale Cancer Center (YCC) strengths including immunobiology, microRNA research, experience with anti-EGFR treatments with acquired resistance, and the behavioral interventions/biological underpinnings of smoking cessation. The goal of the YSILC program is to improve the overall survival rate of lung cancer patients by developing novel therapeutics and personalized prevention strategies based on an understanding of the targetable biochemical and immunological pathways involved in the progression of lung cancer and the acquisition of resistance to therapy. The YSILC translational research team will accomplish this objective through five specific aims: Specific Aim 1: Develop and test novel therapeutics by discovering the mechanisms underlying the response and resistance to anti-PD-1 and anti-B7- H1 (PD-L1) therapies; Specific Aim 2: Evaluate the potential of non-coding microRNAs as targeted therapies; Specific Aim 3: Understand and target the EGFR pathway in mutant/resistant lung cancer; Specific Aim 4: To develop and test the efficacy of a new personalized approach to gain-framed messaging to improve smoking cessation in Americans with asymptomatic lung nodules who continue to smoke; and Specific Aim 5: To develop new research directions and nurture the next generation of translational investigators in lung cancer through a Developmental Research Program and a Career Development Program. Three cores (Administrative; Biostatistics and Bioinformatics; and Biospecimen, Pathology, and Genomics) are proposed to support the projects and their clinical aims, mechanistic studies, and evaluation of biomarkers for clinical application. The highly coordinated YSILC projects, cores, and programs are focused on developing novel lung cancer therapies, with analysis of patient samples, cell-based assays, production of human cell lines and animal models of disease as a guide to design prospective trials that translate these innovative targeted approaches to clinical therapies. The expected translational outcomes of the program include: (1) A highly coordinated and focused development of novel lung cancer therapies; (2) an improved understanding of resistance pathways to PD-1/B7-H1 blockade and EGFR therapies, including prospective studies to overcome/prevent these effects; (3) an understanding of the therapeutic potential of miRNAs in patients; (4) development of effective smoking cessation methods while exploring correlative mechanistic markers; and (5) the development of the next generation of investigators.
