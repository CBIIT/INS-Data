5P50CA165962-09	P50CA165962	10475875	2022	SPORE: Targeted Therapies for Glioma	"This is the competing renewal of a SPORE initiative on glioma at Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center. Our
objective is to improve the standard of care for children, young adults, and adults with these tumors through
the use of targeted therapies. Towards this end, basic scientists from Harvard Medical School and the Broad
Institute join with clinical/translational investigators from Boston Children’s Hospital, Brigham and Women’s
Hospital, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Massachusetts General Hospital. There are four projects:
 Project One targets pediatric low-grade astrocytomas (PLGAs). Nearly 75% of PLGAs are driven by
activating mutations in the BRAF protein kinase. Clinician/scientists Daphne Haas-Kogan, M.D. and Karen
Wright, M.D. together with structural biologist Michael Eck, M.D., Ph.D. will develop and test brain-penetrant
targeted therapeutics for BRAF-mutant PLGAs. Project Two targets IDH-mutant gliomas which present
typically in young adults. IDH-mutant gliomas produce extraordinarily high levels of the ‘oncometabolite’ R-2-
hydroxyglutarate (2-HG). However, therapeutic exploitation of the differential 2-HG content between normal
and malignant brain tissue has yet to be realized. Neurosurgeon Daniel Cahill, M.D., Ph.D. and cancer
biologist William Kaelin, M.D. will address this therapeutic lacuna. Project Three targets adult gliomas.
Recent studies by basic scientist Jean Zhao, Ph.D. show that in addition to suppressing cell cycle progression,
CDK4/6 antagonists promote anti-tumor immunity and synergistically enhance the response to checkpoint
inhibitors. Going forward, Dr. Zhao together with neuro-oncologist Patrick Wen, M.D. will test the hypothesis
that brain penetrant CDK4/6 inhibitors can augment immunotherapeutic approaches to GBM. Project Four
targets the neuronal microenvironment of adult and pediatric gliomas. Neuro-oncologist and developmental
neurobiologist Michelle Monje, M.D., Ph.D. has shown that neurons promote glioma growth through activity-
regulated secretion of neuroligin-3 (NLGN3) into the tumor microenvironment. Basic scientist Mario Suva,
M.D, Ph.D. has refined methods for single cell sequencing of the multiple cell types within the
microenvironment of freshly resected human gliomas. Working together, Monje and Suva will define the
molecular mechanisms whereby microenvironmental NLGN3 modulates formation and progression of gliomas
and explore a novel therapeutic opportunity embedded within the NLGN3 requirement.
 Rigor and reproducibility of work conducted in the four projects will be fostered by cores for Pathology
and for Biostatistics and Computational Biology. An Administration core will enable and manage the
multiple consortium agreements and collaborative interactions between Harvard Medical School, the four
participating Harvard teaching hospitals and facilitate clinical trials and imaging studies. Intellectual vigor
within the program is sustained and refreshed by annual Career Enhancement Awards to young investigators
and by annual Developmental Project Awards."	3-Dimensional;Address;Adjuvant;Adult;Adult Glioblastoma;Adult Glioma;Age;Agreement;Astrocytoma;Award;BRAF gene;Basic Science;Biology;Biometry;Boston;Brain;Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor;CDK4 gene;Cancer Center;Cancer Etiology;Cell Cycle Arrest;Cell Cycle Progression;Cells;Cessation of life;Child;Child Care;Childhood;Childhood Brain Neoplasm;Childhood Glioma;Clinical;Clinical Trials;Collaborations;Complement;Computational Biology;Cyclin D1;Dana-Farber Cancer Institute;Daphne plant;Development;Diagnosis;Doctor of Medicine;Doctor of Philosophy;Enzymes;Excision;Fostering;Funding;General Hospitals;Genetic;Genetically Engineered Mouse;Glioblastoma;Glioma;Growth;Hospitals;Human;Image;Immune checkpoint inhibitor;Immunotherapeutic agent;Immunotherapy;Independent Living;Institutes;International;Lead;Malignant - descriptor;Malignant Neoplasms;Malignant neoplasm of brain;Maps;Massachusetts;Metabolic;Methods;Modality;Molecular;Mutation;Nature;Neurons;Neurosurgeon;Oncologist;Operative Surgical Procedures;Pathology;Patient-Focused Outcomes;Patients;Pediatric Hospitals;Persons;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacology;Phosphorylation;Primary Brain Neoplasms;Protein Isoforms;Protein Kinase;Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases;Quality of life;Recurrence;Reproducibility;Research Personnel;Research Project Grants;Resected;Science;Scientist;Signal Transduction;Structural Biologist;Survivors;Talents;Teaching Hospitals;Testing;The Sun;Therapeutic;Time;Tumor Immunity;Tumor Tissue;Universities;Variant;Woman;Work;alpha ketoglutarate;antagonist;brain tissue;career;cell type;childhood cancer mortality;clinical imaging;efficacy study;flexibility;humanized mouse;imaging study;improved;in vivo;inhibitor;innovation;leukemia;medical schools;melanoma;mouse model;mutant;neuro-oncology;neuroligin 3;novel;novel strategies;novel therapeutics;professor;programmed cell death protein 1;programs;response;single cell sequencing;skills;small molecule;standard of care;targeted treatment;tool;translational scientist;tumor;tumor growth;tumor microenvironment;young adult	BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL	BOSTON	MA	UNITED STATES	Tracy T Batchelor	Leah Hubbard	2250039	2250039	2022-09-01T12:09:00Z	2013-09-19T12:09:00Z	2024-08-31T12:08:00Z	PAR-18-313	award_P50CA165962

3P50CA165962-07S1	P50CA165962	10136362	2020	SPORE: Targeted Therapies for Glioma - Diversity Supplement	"Abstract
Glioblastoma is the most common and the most malignant primary brain tumor with a
median life expectancy of 15 months despite multimodal therapy. Its aggressive nature
is in part due to its ability to escape immune surveillance and to redundant cell signaling
that makes it resistant to single-agent targeted therapies. The cyclin D1-CDK4/6-
retinoblastoma signaling axis has been implicated in cancer immune evasion and
resistance to receptor tyrosine kinase inhibition in multiple cancers. As this axis is
deregulated in 80% of glioblastoma, there is ongoing research into whether inhibition of
CDK4/6 sensitizes glioblastoma to immunotherapy. This project builds on this work by
exploring the role of the epigenetic machinery that is downstream of CDK4/6 signaling
on glioblastoma immune evasion, as well as the role of CDK4/6 signaling on resistance
to EGFR inhibition. To that end, we will determine whether inhibition of the polycomb
repressor complex 2 (PRC2) or of the DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) triggers tumor
cell-intrinsic anti-tumor immunity, and whether PRC2 or DNMT inhibitors synergize with
immune checkpoint blockade in novel immunocompetent patient-derived models of
glioblastoma. We will also determine whether combination EGFR and CDK4/6 inhibition
synergize in a genetically engineered mouse model of glioblastoma driven by EGFRvIII,
the most common EGFR mutation in human glioblastoma. We hope that this work will
uncover rational combinations of targeted therapies or targeted therapies with
immunotherapy that will serve as new therapeutic strategies for patients with
glioblastoma."

2P50CA165962-06A1	P50CA165962	9793304	2019	SPORE: Targeted Therapies for Glioma	"This is the competing renewal of a SPORE initiative on glioma at Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center. Our
objective is to improve the standard of care for children, young adults, and adults with these tumors through
the use of targeted therapies. Towards this end, basic scientists from Harvard Medical School and the Broad
Institute join with clinical/translational investigators from Boston Children’s Hospital, Brigham and Women’s
Hospital, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Massachusetts General Hospital. There are four projects:
 Project One targets pediatric low-grade astrocytomas (PLGAs). Nearly 75% of PLGAs are driven by
activating mutations in the BRAF protein kinase. Clinician/scientists Daphne Haas-Kogan, M.D. and Karen
Wright, M.D. together with structural biologist Michael Eck, M.D., Ph.D. will develop and test brain-penetrant
targeted therapeutics for BRAF-mutant PLGAs. Project Two targets IDH-mutant gliomas which present
typically in young adults. IDH-mutant gliomas produce extraordinarily high levels of the ‘oncometabolite’ R-2-
hydroxyglutarate (2-HG). However, therapeutic exploitation of the differential 2-HG content between normal
and malignant brain tissue has yet to be realized. Neurosurgeon Daniel Cahill, M.D., Ph.D. and cancer
biologist William Kaelin, M.D. will address this therapeutic lacuna. Project Three targets adult gliomas.
Recent studies by basic scientist Jean Zhao, Ph.D. show that in addition to suppressing cell cycle progression,
CDK4/6 antagonists promote anti-tumor immunity and synergistically enhance the response to checkpoint
inhibitors. Going forward, Dr. Zhao together with neuro-oncologist Patrick Wen, M.D. will test the hypothesis
that brain penetrant CDK4/6 inhibitors can augment immunotherapeutic approaches to GBM. Project Four
targets the neuronal microenvironment of adult and pediatric gliomas. Neuro-oncologist and developmental
neurobiologist Michelle Monje, M.D., Ph.D. has shown that neurons promote glioma growth through activity-
regulated secretion of neuroligin-3 (NLGN3) into the tumor microenvironment. Basic scientist Mario Suva,
M.D, Ph.D. has refined methods for single cell sequencing of the multiple cell types within the
microenvironment of freshly resected human gliomas. Working together, Monje and Suva will define the
molecular mechanisms whereby microenvironmental NLGN3 modulates formation and progression of gliomas
and explore a novel therapeutic opportunity embedded within the NLGN3 requirement.
 Rigor and reproducibility of work conducted in the four projects will be fostered by cores for Pathology
and for Biostatistics and Computational Biology. An Administration core will enable and manage the
multiple consortium agreements and collaborative interactions between Harvard Medical School, the four
participating Harvard teaching hospitals and facilitate clinical trials and imaging studies. Intellectual vigor
within the program is sustained and refreshed by annual Career Enhancement Awards to young investigators
and by annual Developmental Project Awards."	3-Dimensional;Address;Adjuvant;Adult;Adult Glioblastoma;Adult Glioma;Age;Agreement;Astrocytoma;Award;BRAF gene;Basic Science;Biology;Biometry;Boston;Brain;Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor;CDK4 gene;Cancer Center;Cancer Etiology;Cell Cycle Arrest;Cell Cycle Progression;Cells;Cessation of life;Child;Child Care;Childhood;Childhood Brain Neoplasm;Childhood Glioma;Clinical;Clinical Trials;Collaborations;Complement;Computational Biology;Cyclin D1;Dana-Farber Cancer Institute;Daphne plant;Development;Diagnosis;Doctor of Medicine;Doctor of Philosophy;Enzymes;Excision;Fostering;Funding;General Hospitals;Genetic;Genetically Engineered Mouse;Glioblastoma;Glioma;Growth;Hospitals;Human;Image;Immune checkpoint inhibitor;Immunotherapeutic agent;Immunotherapy;Independent Living;Institutes;International;Lead;Malignant - descriptor;Malignant Neoplasms;Malignant neoplasm of brain;Maps;Massachusetts;Metabolic;Methods;Modality;Molecular;Mutation;Nature;Neurons;Neurosurgeon;Oncologist;Operative Surgical Procedures;Pathology;Patient-Focused Outcomes;Patients;Pediatric Hospitals;Persons;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacology;Phosphorylation;Primary Brain Neoplasms;Protein Isoforms;Protein Kinase;Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases;Quality of life;Recurrence;Reproducibility;Research Personnel;Research Project Grants;Resected;SLEB2 gene;Science;Scientist;Signal Transduction;Structural Biologist;Survivors;Talents;Teaching Hospitals;Testing;The Sun;Therapeutic;Time;Tumor Immunity;Tumor Tissue;Universities;Variant;Woman;Work;alpha ketoglutarate;brain tissue;career;cell type;childhood cancer mortality;clinical imaging;efficacy study;flexibility;humanized mouse;imaging study;improved;in vivo;inhibitor/antagonist;innovation;leukemia;medical schools;melanoma;mouse model;mutant;neuro-oncology;neuroligin 3;novel;novel strategies;novel therapeutics;professor;programs;response;single cell sequencing;skills;small molecule;standard of care;targeted treatment;tool;translational scientist;tumor;tumor growth;tumor microenvironment;young adult	BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL	BOSTON	MA	UNITED STATES	Tracy T Batchelor	Leah Hubbard	2438174	2438174	2019-09-17T12:09:00Z	2013-09-19T12:09:00Z	2024-08-31T12:08:00Z	PAR-18-313	award_P50CA165962

Our objective is to improve the standard of care through the use of targeted therapies for this type of cancer. Towards this end, basic scientists from Harvard Medical School have joined with clinical/translational investigators from Brigham and Women's Hospital, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Massachusetts General Hospital. This initiative is supported by central cores for Pathology, Biostatistics and Administration and includes career and developmental programs. The study plan uses clinical materials and exploits a number of clinical trials to attack glioblastoma on four distinct fronts: 
Project one targets the tumor vascular system. A cancer biologist, Rakesh Jain, PhD and a neurooncologist, Tracy Batchelor, MD address a current impasse in vascular-based therapies for glioblastoma. Why are patient responses to bevacizumab generally transient and marginal? Jain and Batchelor will test the hypothesis that responses to VEGF pathway inhibitors can be augmented by concurrent or sequential suppression of the angiopoietin-2 signal transduction pathway. 
Project two targets the PI3K signaling axis - a signaling pathway that is activated in ~50% of glioblastomas. Biochemist Tom Roberts, PhD (a co-discoverer of PI3K) and neuro-oncologist Patrick Wen, MD address fundamental issues regarding PI3K signaling in glioblastoma that - when resolved - will greatly optimize the treatment of these tumors with small molecule antagonists of PI3K. 
Project three targets the IDH pathway. Malignant gliomas, including glioblastomas, may harbor gain-of-function mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) resulting in accumulation of 2-hydroxyglutarate (2- HG) promoting tumorigenesis. Molecular biologist William Kaelin, MD and neurosurgeon Daniel Cahill, MD, PhD will use clinical material to test the hypothesis that non-invasive measurement of 2-HG levels can serve as a surrogate for IDH mutant enzyme activity, and that targeting of IDH mutation and 2-HG can afford a breakthrough treatment for malignant glioma patients. 
Project four attacks the Olig2 transcription factor. Molecular biologist Chuck Stiles, PhD has demonstrated an oppositional relationship between the gliogenic transcription factor Olig2 and p53. Building upon these findings, Stiles and radiation oncologist Jay Loeffler, MD will use clinical materials to test the hypothesis that suppression of Olig2 will enhance radiation sensitivity of the major population of glioblastomas (~75%) that retain a structurally intact p53 gene."
