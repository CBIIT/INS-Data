quantitative, mechanistic analysis of immune-microenvironment dynamics in poor prognosis solid tumors.
While immunotherapies are showing remarkable clinical responses in some advanced cancers, to date, their

the effectiveness of natural immune responses and immunotherapies. Yet, our understanding of the physical
and molecular mechanisms governing T cell infiltration, distribution, and function in native tumor
microenvironments remains extremely limited. As such, defining key T cell behaviors as a function of complex

Cancer stem cells (CSCs) play a critical role in fostering tumor resistance to therapies and relapse after
treatment. This presents a crucial barrier to the development of successful anti-cancer therapeutics.
Transcriptional reprogramming and plasticity play a critical role in and out of the CSC state, which in turn are
interdependent on the regulatory function of the three-dimensional (3D) structure of chromatin, epigenetic states,
and other molecular events. Our understanding of fundamental CSC biology has been hampered by the need
for cellular nanoscale imaging technologies that provide both highly detailed structural information regarding 3D
chromatin organization and highly multiplexed molecular imaging of the many molecular regulators and events
involved in CSC processes. We propose to establish the Northwestern University Center for Chromatin
Nanoimaging in Cancer (NU-CCNIC) to address this fundamental technology gap in cellular nanoscale imaging
and deploy the new technologies to address the fundamental knowledge gap in CSC biology. The Center
converges experts in cellular nanoscale imaging, computational imaging, molecular modeling, computational
genomics, CSC biology, and oncology. The Center will develop, test, validate, iterate, and deploy an integrated
and co-registered Multi-scale Chromatin Nanoimaging Platform that will comprise three “nested-doll” imaging
techniques: chromatin scanning transmission electron microscopy, optical spectroscopic super-resolution
nanoscopy, and optical spectroscopic nanosensing. The Nanoimaging Platform will enable quantitative imaging
of chromatin structure and highly multiplexed molecular and gene-specific localization, at the most fundamental
length-scale approaching 1 nm resolution, including the imaging of statistically significant cell populations and
live cells with high temporal resolution over prolonged temporal follow-up times. The Nanoimaging Platform will
be bridged to computational genomics, epigenomics, genome mapping, and predictive transcriptional modeling
datasets. These technologies will be deployed to answer several long-standing open questions in CSC biology.
We will elucidate whether CSCs can originate from non-CSCs via transcriptional reprogramming, test the role of
chromatin structure in fostering transcriptional plasticity in CSC processes, and explore the possibility of
transcriptionally reprogramming CSCs to exit the stem-state as a new therapeutic strategy. All aspects of the
technology development will be guided by the needs of the CSC biology testbed through a series of research
feedback loops. In the long term, such single-cell nanoimaging technologies will help comprehensive
understanding of the complex interplay between structural, physico-chemical, and molecular genomic events.
We anticipate that these convergence studies will provide new insights into CSC biology, which are impossible
to reveal with the use of any single method, and open new opportunities for identifying therapeutic strategies."	3-Dimensional;Address;Aftercare;Biological Assay;Cancer Biology;Cell Nucleus;Cell physiology;Cells;Chromatin;Chromatin Structure;Complex;Computing Methodologies;Cytotoxic Chemotherapy;DNA;Data;Data Set;Development;Diameter;Disease remission;Disparate;Electron Microscopy;Epigenetic Process;Event;Feedback;Fostering;Future;Genes;Genetic;Genetic Transcription;Genome Mappings;Genomics;Growth;Heterogeneity;Image;Imaging Techniques;Imaging technology;Knowledge;Label;Length;Link;Malignant Neoplasms;Methods;Microscopy;Mission;Molecular;Molecular Conformation;Molecular Target;Nanoscopy;Oncology;Optics;Pathway interactions;Pattern;Physics;Play;Population;Process;Relapse;Research;Resistance;Resistance development;Resolution;Role;Scanning;Series;Solid;Stem Cell Research;Techniques;Technology;Testing;Therapeutic;Time;Translating;Transmission Electron Microscopy;Universities;Vision;Visualization;anti-cancer therapeutic;anticancer research;cancer cell;cancer stem cell;cellular imaging;chemotherapy;data modeling;electron tomography;epigenomics;follow-up;frontier;imaging capabilities;imaging platform;insight;live cell microscopy;molecular imaging;molecular modeling;molecular scale;nanoimaging;nanoscale;nanosensors;new technology;novel therapeutic intervention;novel therapeutics;pressure;prevent;programs;quantitative imaging;single molecule;spatiotemporal;stem;stem cell biology;stressor;technology development;temporal measurement;therapeutically effective;therapy resistant;three dimensional structure;transcriptional reprogramming;tumor;tumor progression;ultra high resolution	NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY	Chicago	IL	UNITED STATES	Vadim Backman, Daniela E Matei, Hao F Zhang	Steven Becker	1625368	1625368	2022-11-29T12:11:00Z	2021-12-10T12:12:00Z	2026-11-30T12:11:00Z	RFA-CA-21-002	nofo_RFA-CA-21-002

The mortality rates of breast and pancreatic cancers are intrinsically tied to metastasis. In pancreatic cancer, the
5-year survival rate is only 9% and in ~70% pathological evaluations of the resected tumor, instances of venous
invasion are found. Metastasis is a complex multi-step process involving cancer cells, local vasculature, and the
surrounding microenvironment at multiple sites. Venous invasion in pancreatic cancer, in which cancer cells gain
often invade the portal vein, is an early step in this process and provides the cells a direct path to the liver, the
most common site of pancreatic cancer metastasis. As in pancreatic cancer, invasion past normal breast tissue
barriers is critically tied to breast cancer outcomes. Most breast tumors can be surgically removed, and so
mortality is closely tied to the extent of distant metastasis through lymphovascular invasion. The detection of
lymphovascular invasion in a breast tumor correlates with poor prognosis and is not captured in current molecular
analyses. The spatial organization of cancer cells, and cellular and stromal components of the tumor
microenvironment near and far away from blood vessels is intrinsically three-dimensional, non-symmetric, and
highly heterogeneous. In the TECH units of the Johns Hopkins Center for 3D Multiscale Cancer Imaging, we
will develop a versatile 3D multiscale imaging method, CODA, which will allow us to probe the phenotypic
heterogeneity of tumors from the multi-cm to the micron scale via multiplexing serial imaging. CODA can readily
incorporate other imaging modalities to extract high cellular/molecular content from 3D samples. These include
immunocytochemistry (CODA+IHC), immunofluorescence (CODA+IF), imaging mass cytometry (CODA+IMC)
and spatial transcriptomics/proteomics (CODA+DBiT-seq). These proposed expanded versions of CODA offer
a unique opportunity to produce new 3D multi-omic maps of human PDAC and breast tumors near and far from
blood vessels. CODA and its integrated versions CODA+X will be tested in the RTB units of the Center in both
human/mouse tissue samples and organoids, in breast and pancreatic cancer. Results from these test beds will
provide novel mechanistic insights into venous invasion in breast and pancreatic cancer. Exploiting our extensive
experience in data dissemination, we will make the large datasets and software produced by our CODA+X
platforms and software widely available to the larger cancer research community. The units of the Center will be
co-led by Johns Hopkins/Yale engineers, scientists and physicians. Substantial additional support will be

In response to the RFA for a Cellular Cancer Biology Imaging Program we propose a program focused on
imaging and molecularly probing the cell biological events that drive the formation of new metastatic tumors.
Specifically, we will address two questions: 1) How does the intersection of shifts in cell-intrinsic and cell-
extrinsic signals associated with shifts in expression of the membrane adaptor protein Caveolin-1 affect the
metastatic propensity of pediatric sarcoma (Research Testbed Unit 1)? 2) What are the effects of cell-intrinsic
and cell-extrinsic variation in lipid metabolism on melanoma metastasis patterns (Research Testbed Unit 2)?
Answers to both questions depend on technology to capture the molecular, metabolic, and morphological
states of individual metastatic cells as they colonize the distant site: In the Technology Development Unit-1 we
will develop a multi-modal, multi-scale live imaging platform to investigate the effects of intersecting
microenvironmental variation across an organism and cell intrinsic heterogeneity on metastatic spreading. The
platform will leverage the exquisite optical and physiological properties of the zebrafish embryos to ‘watch’ at
once how cells form human tumor xenografts spread to multiple distant sites where they form metastatic
tumors. The microscope will allow seamless switching between a high-throughput screening mode observing
the metastatic patterns in tens to hundreds of embryos in one experiment and a high-resolution imaging mode
with fully isotropic resolution of 300 nm in XYZ that allows detailed analysis of the molecular, metabolic,
morphologic, and proliferation/survival states of individual cells within an emerging metastatic niche. In the
Technology Development Unit-2 we will develop a multi-scale imaging platform to investigate by hyper-spectral
analysis the molecular, metabolic, morphological, and functional states of metastatic cells across entire mouse
organs. The platform will leverage advances in tissue clearing, fully automated high-speed and high-resolution
light-sheet fluorescence imaging, and computer vision, to integrate a mesoscopic imaging mode for fast
acquisition of volumes of up to 20 x 20 x 20 mm at a ~5-10 micron isotropic resolution with a nanoscopic
imaging mode providing 300 nm XYZ-resolution throughout a 300 micron field of view anywhere in the organ.
Biological features can thus be rapidly identified and immediately interrogated with high subcellular resolution.
We will then develop physically and chemically accelerated 60-plex cyclic immunofluorescence assays to
comprehensively characterize the molecular, metabolic and architectural states of colonizing cells and their
surroundings in the metastatic niche in thick (~200 microns) tissue sections. To accurately describe metastatic
heterogeneity, the entire system, including sample handling, labeling, and imaging, will be fully automated and
operated in a high-throughput fashion. Our goal with this system is to enable comprehensive profiling of
heterogeneous cell metastatic cell behavior in 100’s of intact tissue specimens. Together, these platforms will
generate versatile imaging tools for a new era of in situ cancer cell biology."	3-Dimensional;Adaptor Signaling Protein;Address;Adopted;Affect;Algorithms;Architecture;Automobile Driving;Biological;Biological Assay;Biological Models;Blood Vessels;Cancer Biology;Cancer Etiology;Carcinoma in Situ;Cells;Cellular Morphology;Cellular biology;Cessation of life;Chemicals;Clinical Treatment;Communities;Computer Vision Systems;Core Facility;Data;Development;Disease;Distant;Educational workshop;Embryo;Environment;Environmental Risk Factor;Event;Ewings sarcoma;Extracellular Matrix;Goals;Heterogeneity;Human;Image;Imaging Device;Immunofluorescence Immunologic;In Situ;Individual;Informatics;Institution;Intelligence;Intrinsic factor;Invaded;Investigation;Label;Light;Malignant - descriptor;Malignant Bone Neoplasm;Malignant Neoplasms;Membrane;Membrane Proteins;Metabolic;Metabolism;Methods;Microscope;Microscopy;Molecular;Molecular Analysis;Molecular Probes;Morphology;Mus;NCI Center for Cancer Research;Neoplasm Metastasis;Oncogenic;Optics;Organ;Organism;Pattern;Periodicity;Physiological;Pilot Projects;Play;Primary Neoplasm;Process;Property;Research;Research Personnel;Resolution;Role;Sampling;Series;Side;Signal Transduction;Site;Solid Neoplasm;Specimen;Speed;Subgroup;System;Technology;Testing;Thick;Tissue imaging;Tissues;Training;Tropism;Variant;WNT Signaling Pathway;Work;Xenograft procedure;Zebrafish;cancer cell;caveolin 1;cell behavior;childhood sarcoma;cloud based;dimensional analysis;experimental study;fluorescence imaging;functional adaptation;high dimensionality;high resolution imaging;high throughput screening;imaging approach;imaging platform;imaging probe;imaging program;intravital imaging;lipid metabolism;live cell imaging;lymphatic vessel;melanoma;molecular imaging;multimodality;multiplexed imaging;novel;outreach;programs;quantitative imaging;response;technology development;tumor xenograft	UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER	DALLAS	TX	UNITED STATES	Gaudenz Danuser	Steven Becker	1609318	1609318	2022-08-16T12:08:00Z	2021-09-24T12:09:00Z	2026-08-31T12:08:00Z	RFA-CA-21-002	nofo_RFA-CA-21-002
