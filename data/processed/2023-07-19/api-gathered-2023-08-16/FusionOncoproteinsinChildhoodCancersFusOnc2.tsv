1U54CA231637-01	U54CA231637	9600132	2018	The Center for Therapeutic Targeting of EWS-oncoproteins	"PROJECT SUMMARY: Overall
The primary scientific focus of this Center is to understand the molecular underpinnings of EWS-ETS driven
Ewing sarcoma and to investigate novel treatments and therapeutic mechanisms to improve outcomes for
pediatric patients with this aggressive disease. Translation of molecular understanding of sarcoma
pathophysiology into effective new drugs in the clinic is a complex, risky proposition that requires the coordinated
efforts of a talented team of individuals with complementary skills. This group brings expertise in Ewing sarcoma
biology and the EWS-ETS oncoproteins, epigenetics and transcription, structural biology, computational biology,
chemical biology and drug development, mouse models, preclinical experimental therapeutics, and clinical trials
development. A Center mechanism is essential to the success of this proposal. No one institution nor individual
can bring mastery of the diversity of approaches, technologies, and scientific domains needed to achieve the
goals of this proposal. We have elected to focus on understanding the fundamental inner workings of Ewing
sarcoma from its transcriptional circuits, to the direct protein interactions with EWS-FLI1, to the direct and
immediate effects of EWS-FLI1 degradation. Moreover, a strong emphasis of this proposal is on target
identification and preclinical validation, critical steps in the process of bringing forward therapies with optimal
chances for success in the clinic. The team that is assembled has all of the component pieces needed for
success. Our Center includes outstanding basic cancer biologists, chemists, computational biologists, and
translational researchers, and five pediatric oncologists. Thus, the proposed Center can catalyze basic discovery
and clinical translation by leveraging basic and clinical research talent within the Center and our strong ties to
outside academic and industrial partners."

1U54CA231641-01	U54CA231641	9600275	2018	An integrated approach to analyze and target EWS/FLI in Ewing sarcoma	"Overall Section Summary/Abstract
The overarching goal of our FusOnC2 TEST (Targeting the Ewing Sarcoma Translocation) Center is to develop a new mechanistic understanding of EWS/FLI that will allow for the development of new therapeutic approaches for Ewing sarcoma based on inhibiting EWS/FLI.  EWS/FLI is an aberrant oncogenic transcription factor formed by the t(11;22)(q24;q12) chromosomal translocation that is the driver oncoprotein of this tumor.  Multiple independent studies demonstrate a critical dependence of Ewing sarcoma cells on EWS/FLI such that blockade of the translocation is associated with a loss of proliferation, loss of cell cycle progression and ultimately reversal of oncogenic transformation.  Thus, most investigators believe that inhibition of EWS/FLI in the clinic would be the best way to treat patients with Ewing sarcoma.  

Traditional chemical design of EWS/FLI inhibitors has proven challenging because the molecule does not contain traditionally “druggable” pockets.  We therefore hypothesize that a deeper scientific understanding of EWS/FLI transcriptional function in Ewing sarcoma will allow for identification of new agents.

The FusOnC2 TEST Center will focus on two critical molecular features of EWS/FLI required for its transcriptional and oncogenic function:  (i) binding of EWS/FLI to GGAA-microsatellites and related DNA response elements, and (ii) EWS/FLI self-association activities to form “hubs” that coordinate protein-interactions through low-complexity domains to mediate transcriptional function.

Targeting EWS/FLI requires diverse expertise to be focused on this problem.  The TEST Center is designed to facilitate both independent and highly-focused studies on critical components of EWS/FLI function, while at the same time interacting with the entire FusOnC2 consortium to share new knowledge, techniques, and expertise that will help facilitate the development of new therapeutic approaches to Ewing sarcoma.  We believe that the TEST Center will contribute greatly to the overall success of the FusOnC2 Consortium, and help to change the paradigm for how new therapies are developed for pediatric translocation-associated cancers."

Abstract 
The overarching goal of this FusOnC2 Center for Synovial Sarcoma Biology and Therapeutics is to develop and execute a comprehensive, multidisciplinary set of approaches rooted in protein biochemistry and structural biology to define the mechanistic underpinnings of synovial sarcoma and unmask opportunities for therapeutic development. This Center’s mission is tightly aligned with that of the larger Consortium on Fusion Oncoproteins in Childhood Cancers and the Beau Biden Cancer Moonshot Initiative. A major impetus for the development of this Consortium has been the growing knowledge that fusion oncoproteins that are pathognomonic for specific cancer types often function via disruption of the structure and/or activity of protein complexes that govern chromatin architecture and hence gene control. We have shown that at least two of the fusion oncoproteins highlighted as major areas of emphasis within the Consortium, SS18-SSX and EWS-FLI1, bind and act via BAF complexes to drive cancer-specific oncogenic gene expression. Importantly, genetic studies across human cancer types have indicated that genes encoding encoding mSWI/SNF complex subunits are among the most frequently mutated, at over 20% of all human cancers, further underscoring the need for a detailed understanding of BAF complex structure, topology and mechanisms on chromatin. 
Our multi-institutional collaborative network seeks to comprehensively interrogate biologic mechanisms underpinning the function of the SS18-SSX oncogenic fusion protein in synovial sarcoma and to use the approaches and the results generated to launch targeted therapeutic discovery campaigns that are directly linked to the mechanisms identified. Specifically, our approach encompasses three major areas: (1) BAF complex genomic targeting, gene regulation, and chromatin state interactions, including interactions with other chromatin regulators; (2) Understanding the role of the wild-type SS18 protein, its protein-level regulation, and mechanisms by which its stabilization can reverse SS18-SSX-mediated BAF complex activity and be exploited for therapeutic benefit; (3) Mechanistically characterizing synovial sarcoma-specific vulnerabilities, centered in chromatin-bound protein complexes and related pathways. The highly integrative nature of the PI-directed research projects and expertise within collaborator laboratories provide the strongest possible likelihood that the aims will be successfully achieved and that novel therapeutic strategies will emerge from this Center."

This application responds to RFA-CA-17-049 by proposing the establishment of a center distributed across
three institutions with labs all focusing on the biology of the SS18-SSX (formerly called SYT-SSX) fusion
oncogene. Among the FusOnC2 consortium cancers of interest, synovial sarcoma has the highest incidence in
the United States and worldwide, but has been a specifically underserved malignancy due to its predilection for
the adolescent and young adult population and its relatively poor responsiveness to systemic therapy,
compared to other pediatric sarcomas that also associate with fusion oncogenes. While much of the biology of
SS18-SSX remains unknown and synovial sarcoma patients represent a clearly underserved, orphan-disease
population, there are two principles at the extremes of the cancer biology spectrum that are well established.
First, SS18-SSX has proven the capacity to recapitulate synovial sarcomagenesis faithfully in the mouse
without the need of introduced or stochastically acquired secondary genetic changes, second SS18-SSX has
biochemically demonstrated interactions with an important chromatin remodeling complex called SWI/SNF or
BAF. This application proposes to build three research projects focused on the cell biology of transformation,
genome-wide chromatin biology and SWI/SNF (BAF) complex componentry biology, each related to SS18-
SSX. These discovery biology and therapeutic target identification efforts will be supported by two shared
resource cores that will provide human validation of therapeutic targets and preclinical testing of therapeutic
strategies. The group of investigators has developed as an organically assembled network of collaborations,
built over the last decade, during which time each project has gathered substantial preliminary data using a
variety of functional screens, a newly identified cell of origin, the ability to track SS18-SSX genome wide
localization and protein interactions, a powerful system to produce and evaluate recombinant SWI/SNF (BAF)
complexes with variable componentry, and powerful mouse genetic models of synovial sarcoma—including
spontaneous development of metastatic disease. Preliminary data are sufficiently robust to recommend
therapeutic strategies immediately from each research project for the cores to validate and evaluate in clinically
relevant mouse models and quantitative molecular imaging."

Due to a chromothripsis event on chromosome 11, the majority of supratentorial ependymomas generate and
express the gene fusion C11orf95-RELA fusion (RELAFus). The goal of the U54 titled “Biology and therapy of
C11orf95-RELA fusion-driven ependymoma is to understand the biology of this fusion protein and the two
components that make up the fusion and determine the requirements for continued expression of this fusion
protein and what pathways downstream are critical for oncogenesis. We will use a combination of novel mouse
models and human neuro stem cell systems with readouts of single cell analysis, immunology, tumor
microenvironment, systems biology, and data visualization. In addition to the administrative core, the grant has
three main Projects, a data visualization and sharing core. The research projects include, Project 1) Mechanisms
and models of C11or95 and C11or95-RELA fusions (RELAFus), Project 2) Genetic interrogation of therapeutic
vulnerabilities for C11orf95-RELA fusion, and Project 3) Identifying small molecules with therapeutic effects in
RELAFus -driven EPN and testing them in preclinical genetically engineered models of EPN."

Fusion oncoproteins (FO) arising from the rearrangement of Nucleoporin 98 (NUP98) to a diverse range of
partner genes are a hallmark of multiple subtypes of high risk myeloid malignancies in children and adolescents,
including acute erythroleukemia and acute megakaryoblastic leukemia. Such leukemias are associated with poor
outcome, and more effective therapies are required. The long-term goal of this Center for Experimental and
Preclinical Modeling of NUP98 Leukemia is to determine the molecular role, and potential vulnerabilities, of
NUP98-fusion oncoproteins in leukemia through the development and interrogation of human and mouse model
systems, and to develop and test novel therapeutic approaches. The Center has assembled a consortium of
investigators with complementary expertise in genomic characterization, leukemia modeling, chromatin biology,
structural biology and preclinical modeling. The Center is led by Dr Charles Mullighan of St Jude Children’s
Research Hospital together with Project Co-Leaders Drs Scott Armstrong (Dana Farber Cancer Institute),
Taosheng Chen (St Jude), Alex Kentsis (Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Institute), Jeffery Klco (St Jude) and
Richard Kriwacki (St Jude). These investigators will co-Lead four projects performing experimental modeling
(Project 1), investigating chromatin biology (Project 2), phase separation (Project 3) and drug development
(Project 4) that will address the following questions and unmet needs: (1) to define how NUP98 fusions drive
leukemogenesis using complementary, integrative engineered models and proteomic, transcriptomic and
epigenomic profiles; (2) to develop genetically faithful engineered mouse, human and xenograft models of
NUP98 leukemia for mechanistic interrogation and preclinical modeling; (3) to define the macromolecular
chromatin and protein complexes assembled by NUP98 FOs; (4) to define the role of phase separation in NUP98
FO leukemogenesis; (5) to define the dependencies and vulnerabilities of NUP98-rearranged leukemic cells;
and (6) to develop more effective therapeutic strategies for NUP98-rearranged leukemia. The Center is
supported by an Administrative Core A that with an External Advisory Board will oversee project progress
interaction and reporting, a Genome Editing Core B led by Dr David Chen (City of Hope) that provides expertise
and support for CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing scans and screens; and a Chemistry Core C led by Dr Zoran
Rankovic (St Jude) that supports chemical library screen and drug design and development. This highly
integrated, interactive and synergistic Center will provide fundamental insights into the mechanisms of
oncogenesis of the different classes of NUP98 FO, and new therapeutic modalities that will be validated in
preclinical models and translated into human clinical trials. All data and resources will be made freely available

3U54CA231630-01A1S1	U54CA231630	10221081	2020	Defining and targeting the molecular vulnerabilities of the PAX3-FOXO1 protein in rhabdomyosarcoma	"ABSTRACT – Overall (revised)
Fusion-positive alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (ARMS) remains one of the most fatal but least understood cancers of childhood. The driving oncoprotein in ARMS is the PAX3-FOXO1 fusion protein, a chimeric transcription factor that hijacks normal gene expression and chromatin state. Five-year survival for children with PAX3-FOXO1- positive ARMS is ~30% for all-comers, and <10% when metastatic. Despite the discovery of PAX3-FOXO1 in 1993, treatment strategies for affected children remain unchanged. This deficiency stems equally from a lack of understanding of the basic biology of the disease and an inability to directly target the fusion protein. No systematic or comprehensive approach has been undertaken to identify the proteins and regulatory elements required to support PAX3-FOXO1-mediated tumorigenesis. As a result, the field has been limited to a patchwork of data with no unified scientific strategy. To overcome this, this FusOnC2 Center has an innovative team and dynamic environment in which data interpretation is informed by complementary technological approaches and by biological and clinical knowledge. This comprehensive approach will transform understanding of PAX3-FOXO1-mediated oncogenesis and create opportunities for therapeutic intervention. The Center’s overarching goal is to advance the therapeutic tractability of the PAX3-FOXO1 fusion protein in ARMS by comprehensively identifying the druggable co-regulators, modulators, and intrinsic activities of PAX3-FOXO1. To accomplish this goal, the Center includes two complementary Projects, each led by expert RMS biologists paired with specialists in pioneering experimental approaches undertaking the most cutting-edge research in cancer biology, genomics, proteomics, structural biology, and medicinal chemistry. The Projects will be supported by RMS investigators within each project who will provide curated RMS cell lines, unique human primary RMS tumor cells, and murine models to enable rapid in vitro and in vivo validation and cross-prioritization of targets. An Administrative Core will integrate and coordinate the Center components, providing leadership and oversight, and promoting cross-pollination of ideas and resources. The Overall Specific Aims are to: (1) define and target the PAX3-FOXO1 interactome; and (2) perform chemical probe discovery for PAX3-FOXO1 to create additional tools for investigating the fundamental biology and tractability of PAX3-FOXO1 and fusion-positive RMS. Approaches used include proximity labeling, saturation mutagenesis, single and combinatorial CRISPR screens, high-throughput phenotypic assays, and mechanistically unbiased approaches to chemical probe discovery using novel high-throughput binding assays. We will use information gleaned to prioritize targets and agents for validation and to inform compound optimization and PROTAC preparation. This Center’s strengths and resources will synergize with the FusOnC2 Consortium, speeding development of knowledge generalizable to the biology of multiple fusion oncoproteins in childhood cancers, accelerating advances in clinical care."

Fusion-positive alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (ARMS) remains one of the most fatal but least understood cancers of childhood. The driving oncoprotein in ARMS is the PAX3-FOXO1 fusion protein, a chimeric transcription factor that hijacks normal gene expression and chromatin state. Five-year survival for children with PAX3-FOXO1- positive ARMS is ~30% for all-comers, and <10% when metastatic. Despite the discovery of PAX3-FOXO1 in 1993, treatment strategies for affected children remain unchanged. This deficiency stems equally from a lack of understanding of the basic biology of the disease and an inability to directly target the fusion protein. No systematic or comprehensive approach has been undertaken to identify the proteins and regulatory elements required to support PAX3-FOXO1-mediated tumorigenesis. As a result, the field has been limited to a patchwork of data with no unified scientific strategy. To overcome this, this FusOnC2 Center has an innovative team and dynamic environment in which data interpretation is informed by complementary technological approaches and by biological and clinical knowledge. This comprehensive approach will transform understanding of PAX3-FOXO1-mediated oncogenesis and create opportunities for therapeutic intervention. The Center’s overarching goal is to advance the therapeutic tractability of the PAX3-FOXO1 fusion protein in ARMS by comprehensively identifying the druggable co-regulators, modulators, and intrinsic activities of PAX3-FOXO1. To accomplish this goal, the Center includes two complementary Projects, each led by expert RMS biologists paired with specialists in pioneering experimental approaches undertaking the most cutting-edge research in cancer biology, genomics, proteomics, structural biology, and medicinal chemistry. The Projects will be supported by RMS investigators within each project who will provide curated RMS cell lines, unique human primary RMS tumor cells, and murine models to enable rapid in vitro and in vivo validation and cross-prioritization of targets. An Administrative Core will integrate and coordinate the Center components, providing leadership and oversight, and promoting cross-pollination of ideas and resources. The Overall Specific Aims are to: (1) define and target the PAX3-FOXO1 interactome; and (2) perform chemical probe discovery for PAX3-FOXO1 to create additional tools for investigating the fundamental biology and tractability of PAX3-FOXO1 and fusion-positive RMS. Approaches used include proximity labeling, saturation mutagenesis, single and combinatorial CRISPR screens, high-throughput phenotypic assays, and mechanistically unbiased approaches to chemical probe discovery using novel high-throughput binding assays. We will use information gleaned to prioritize targets and agents for validation and to inform compound optimization and PROTAC preparation. This Center’s strengths and resources will synergize with the FusOnC2 Consortium, speeding development of knowledge generalizable to the biology of multiple fusion oncoproteins in childhood cancers, accelerating advances in clinical care."

Fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma (FLC) is a usually lethal primary tumor in children, adolescents and young adults.

This project will determine how the fusion oncoprotein leads to pathogenesis and will develop therapeutics targeted to the fusion oncoprotein. Pathogenesis is being probed by examining what is different about the fusion oncoprotein that causes changes in the cell.

1U54CA243124-01	U54CA243124	9834651	2019	Experimental and preclinical modeling of NUP98-rearranged acute leukemia	"PROJECT SUMMARY - Overview
Fusion oncoproteins (FO) arising from the rearrangement of Nucleoporin 98 (NUP98) to a diverse range of
partner genes are a hallmark of multiple subtypes of high risk myeloid malignancies in children and adolescents,
including acute erythroleukemia and acute megakaryoblastic leukemia. Such leukemias are associated with poor
outcome, and more effective therapies are required. The long-term goal of this Center for Experimental and
Preclinical Modeling of NUP98 Leukemia is to determine the molecular role, and potential vulnerabilities, of
NUP98-fusion oncoproteins in leukemia through the development and interrogation of human and mouse model
systems, and to develop and test novel therapeutic approaches. The Center has assembled a consortium of
investigators with complementary expertise in genomic characterization, leukemia modeling, chromatin biology,
structural biology and preclinical modeling. The Center is led by Dr Charles Mullighan of St Jude Children’s
Research Hospital together with Project Co-Leaders Drs Scott Armstrong (Dana Farber Cancer Institute),
Taosheng Chen (St Jude), Alex Kentsis (Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Institute), Jeffery Klco (St Jude) and
Richard Kriwacki (St Jude). These investigators will co-Lead four projects performing experimental modeling
(Project 1), investigating chromatin biology (Project 2), phase separation (Project 3) and drug development
(Project 4) that will address the following questions and unmet needs: (1) to define how NUP98 fusions drive
leukemogenesis using complementary, integrative engineered models and proteomic, transcriptomic and
epigenomic profiles; (2) to develop genetically faithful engineered mouse, human and xenograft models of
NUP98 leukemia for mechanistic interrogation and preclinical modeling; (3) to define the macromolecular
chromatin and protein complexes assembled by NUP98 FOs; (4) to define the role of phase separation in NUP98
FO leukemogenesis; (5) to define the dependencies and vulnerabilities of NUP98-rearranged leukemic cells;
and (6) to develop more effective therapeutic strategies for NUP98-rearranged leukemia. The Center is
supported by an Administrative Core A that with an External Advisory Board will oversee project progress
interaction and reporting, a Genome Editing Core B led by Dr David Chen (City of Hope) that provides expertise
and support for CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing scans and screens; and a Chemistry Core C led by Dr Zoran
Rankovic (St Jude) that supports chemical library screen and drug design and development. This highly
integrated, interactive and synergistic Center will provide fundamental insights into the mechanisms of
oncogenesis of the different classes of NUP98 FO, and new therapeutic modalities that will be validated in
preclinical models and translated into human clinical trials. All data and resources will be made freely available
by websites, data deposition, and establishment of resource and genomic data portals to the FusOnC2
consortium and broad scientific community."

1U54CA231649-01A1	U54CA231649	9834547	2019	Targeting EWSR1-FLI1 through Functional, Structural and Chemical Approaches	"Ewing sarcoma is the second most common bone and soft tissue malignancy in children and adolescents. The
five-year survival of Ewing sarcoma patients is 70%, and falls to less than 20% for those with metastatic
disease, a situation that has not improved despite many years of increasingly intensive chemotherapy
regimens. Survivors of Ewing sarcoma often suffer long-term deleterious effects of treatment. An immediate
need exists for the development of effective, targeted therapies with decreased toxicity. Molecularly, Ewing
sarcoma is characterized by one of several reciprocal chromosomal translocations that fuse a FET family
protein with an ETS transcription factor, the most common of which is EWSR1-FLI1. The EWSR1-FLI1 fusion
protein is completely specific to Ewing sarcoma tumor cells, and thus presents an ideal target for novel
therapeutics. To date, however, no such targeted therapy has become clinically available, owing to 4 major
knowledge gaps. First, there is a dearth of robust in vitro model systems for functional studies of EWSR1-FLI1.
Knockdown studies in Ewing sarcoma cell lines can give inconsistent results, and few primary cell types
tolerate exogenous EWSR1-FLI1 expression. Second, the protein encoded by the EWSR1-FLI1 fusion is a
transcription factor, and there is widespread perception that such proteins are “undruggable”. Third, lead
candidates of small-molecule screens reported to date have either not been shown to have a mechanistic link
to EWSR1-FLI1, or fail to replicate the phenotype of Ewing sarcoma cells depleted of EWSR1-FLI1 activity.
Fourth, the field has lacked relevant animal models for functional genomics and preclinical testing. Developing
targeted therapy for Ewing sarcoma will require an integrated approach executed by an experienced team. Our
strategy is based on several fundamentals, namely 1) systems to specifically deplete and reconstitute the
EWSR1-FLI1 protein in cells; 2) an understanding of the structural biochemistry of low-complexity (LC)
domains found in EWSR1 and related proteins; and 3) novel in vivo models of Ewing sarcoma for functional
genomics and drug testing. Standing on this foundation, we will perform biochemical and genetic experiments
to identify the binding partners and functional effectors of EWSR1-FLI1 and dissect its mechanisms of
transcriptional activation. We will use our experimental systems to conduct phenotypic and target-based high-
throughput screens. Finally, we are well-positioned to perform the work required to transform a compound with
promising initial activity into a preclinical drug lead. Our approach to drug discovery is built upon medicinal
chemistry coupled with secondary assays that maximize potency and specificity of lead compounds. We will
perform target identification for lead compounds using strategies our team has successfully used for several
agents currently in active preclinical development. A dedicated preclinical pharmacology core, highly integrated
with the projects and with the high throughput screening core and medicinal chemistry core, will ensure
optimization of delivery, PK/PD and toxicity properties of the most promising lead compounds."
