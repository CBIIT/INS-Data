phs003922,Atezolizumab Plus Personalized Neoantigen Vaccination in Patients with    Urothelial Cancer: a Phase 1 Trial,Cancer Vaccines,2025-03-25,,Kidney Neoplasms; Ureteral Neoplasms; Urethral Neoplasms; Urinary Bladder Neoplasms; Kidney Tumor; Kidney cancer,"<p>This is a phase 1 single center clinical trial evaluating a multi-peptide personalized neoantigen vaccine, PGV001, in combination with atezolizumab for patients with urothelial cancer. Patients were enrolled in either the adjuvant or metastatic setting. Those in the adjuvant setting included patients considered high risk of recurrence (pathological stage ypT2-T4 or ypN+ for those treated with prior neoadjuvant chemotherapy or pT3-T4 or pN+ for those not treated with prior neoadjuvant chemotherapy). Those in the metastatic setting included patients progressing after prior chemotherapy or those with at least stable disease after chemotherapy treated as &#8220;switch maintenance&#8221; therapy. The primary endpoint was feasibility (including the number of neoantigens identified per patient, vaccine production time, the proportion of patients consenting to the vaccine development phase for whom a vaccine product was prepared, and the proportion of patients eligible for the treatment phase who completed the priming cycle 1 of PGV001 plus atezolizumab) and safety. Secondary endpoints included the objective response rate, progression-free survival or disease-free survival, overall survival, and immunomodulatory effects of treatment. Urothelial tumor tissue and normal tissue or peripheral blood specimens were utilized for DNA sequencing. HLA typing was performed utilizing genomic DNA isolated from whole blood, and RNA sequencing was performed utilizing tumor tissue specimens. Neoantigen prediction and final selection for incorporation into the vaccine was determined by the OpenVax computational pipeline. 12 patients were initially enrolled into the vaccine development phase and 10 patients initiated the treatment phase. PGV001 was administered with poly-ICLC and tetanus peptide on subsequent days for up to 10 doses, including an initial priming cycle 1. Atezolizumab was administered every 3 weeks for up to 1 year in the adjuvant setting or 2 years in the metastatic setting. The vaccine was feasible and safe, the median vaccine production time was 20.3 weeks, and 100% of patients that initiated the treatment phase completed the priming cycle. The most common treatment-related adverse events were local grade 1 injection site reactions, fever, and fatigue. Three of the 4 patients in the adjuvant setting remained disease-free at median follow-up of 39.5 months. There was a 40% objective response rate among patients with measurable disease in the metastatic setting. The single patient treated as &#8220;switch maintenance&#8221; therapy remained with no evidence of disease at 39.4 month follow-up. All patients demonstrated on-treatment neoantigen-specific T cell reactivity, as measured by ELISPOT and flow cytometry assays. Overall, PGV001 plus atezolizumab was feasible, safe, and warrants further investigation.

phs003610,"Circulating, Cell-Free DNA Methylation Patterns Indicate Cellular Sources    of Allograft Injury after Liver Transplant",DNA Methylation,2025-03-25,,,"<p>Post-transplant complications reduce allograft and recipient survival. Current approaches for detecting allograft injury non-invasively are limited and do not differentiate between cellular mechanisms. Here, we monitor cellular damages after liver transplants from cell-free DNA (cfDNA) fragments released from dying cells into the circulation. We analyzed longitudinal blood samples collected from patients at different time points after transplant. Sequence-based methylation of cfDNA fragments were mapped to an atlas of cell-type-specific DNA methylation patterns derived from 476 methylomes of purified cells. For liver cell types, DNA methylation patterns and multi-omic data integration show distinct enrichment in open chromatin and regulatory regions functionally important for the respective cell types. We find that multi-tissue cellular damage post-transplant recovers in patients without allograft injury during the first post-operative week. However, sustained elevation of hepatocyte and biliary epithelial cfDNA within the first month indicates early-onset allograft injury. Further, cfDNA composition differentiates amongst causes of allograft injury indicating the potential for non-invasive monitoring and timely intervention. </p>",Anton Wellstein,,"RO1CA231291, P30CA51008, T32CA009686, F30CA250307",Epigenetics;Methylation Sequencing;Transcriptome Sequencing,,,Liver Transplantation;Epigenetics,62.0,160.0,GRU-IRB-PUB-COL,RNA-Seq;ATAC-seq;ChIP-Seq;Bisulfite-Seq,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs003610,nan,nan,3da0f95b-ddbe-4177-99f7-d5781f229bd7,dbGaP

For example, <a href=""https://www.genome.gov/Funded-Programs-Projects/Cancer-Genome-Atlas"" target=""_blank"">The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)</a>, <a href=""https://docs.icgc-argo.org/docs/data-access/icgc-25k-data"" target=""_blank"">International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC)</a> and other similar efforts are identifying genomic alterations associated with specific cancers (e.g., copy number aberrations, rearrangements, point mutations, epigenomic changes, etc.) The availability of these multi-dimensional data to the scientific community sets the stage for the development of new molecularly targeted cancer interventions. Understanding the comprehensive functional changes in cancer proteomes arising from genomic alterations and other factors is the next logical step in the development of high-value candidate protein biomarkers. Hence, proteomics can greatly advance the understanding of molecular mechanisms of disease pathology via the analysis of changes in protein expression, their modifications and variations, as well as protein=protein interaction, signaling pathways and networks responsible for cellular functions such as apoptosis and oncogenesis. Realizing this great potential, the NCI launched the third phase of the CPTC initiative in September 2016. As the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium, CPTAC continues to define cancer proteomes on genomically-characterized biospecimens. The purpose of this integrative approach was to provide the broad scientific community with knowledge that links genotype to proteotype and ultimately phenotype. In this third phase of CPTAC, the program aims to expand on CPTAC II and genomically and proteomically characterize over 2000 samples from 10 cancer types (Lung Adenocarcinoma, Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma, Glioblastoma Multiforme, Acute Myeloid Leukemia, Clear cell renal Carcinoma, Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma, Cutaneous Melanoma, Sarcoma, Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma, Uterine Corpus Endometrial Carcinoma) .Germline DNA is obtained from blood and Normal control samples for proteomics varied by organ site.

Because resistance to trastuzumab eventually results in progressive disease in the metastatic setting and contributes to recurrence following adjuvant trastuzumab-based therapy, it is important to develop agents other than trastuzumab that target HER2 signaling through different mechanisms of action. Lapatinib is an oral, small molecule, dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor of HER2 and <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1956"" target=""_blank"">EGFR</a>. Lapatinib has shown a lack of cross-resistance with trastuzumab in preclinical studies and activity in women with HER2-positive, metastatic breast cancer that has progressed during trastuzumab treatment. Trastuzumab blocks the downstream signaling of HER2 by binding to the extracellular domain of the receptor. Lapatinib binds to the intracellular domains of HER2 and EGFR and prevents activation of downstream signaling pathways. Because of this different mechanism of action, lapatinib may be effective in trastuzumab-resistant disease. The study will also provide important safety information on trastuzumab and lapatinib combinations immediately following anthracycline exposure, and also provide an initial direct comparison of cardiac effects of trastuzumab and lapatinib when incorporated into a standard sequential adriamycin and cyclophosphamide (AC) followed by weekly paclitaxel neoadjuvant regimen. </p><p>Availability of a second agent that can interrupt HER2-signaling pathways through completely different mechanisms than those of trastuzumab offers the potential for further improvement in the management of patients with HER2-overexpressing breast cancer in both the adjuvant and metastatic setting. Co-administration of both trastuzumab and lapatinib with chemotherapy may be important in improving outcomes in subsets of HER2-positive breast cancers. However, use of two inhibitors of the HER2 pathway will increase costs and may increase toxicity, so it will be important to identify the subsets of patients who would benefit from the dual therapy. Inhibition of HER2 with a single agent clearly is sufficient for many patients as evidenced by the results of the trastuzumab trials. Therefore, co-administration to unselected populations of women with HER2-positive breast cancers would not represent an optimal approach. Given the activity of lapatinib, it is likely that it will also be sufficiently active in inhibiting HER2-pathway activation in some patients to allow for its use as the sole inhibitor of the HER2 pathway. Different populations may also derive greater benefit from one of the HER2-blocking agents relative to the other. Identification of potential predictive factors for pathologic complete response to the combination or to either agent administered alone in neoadjuvant trials would provide important information for adjuvant trials designed to definitively address these important issues. </p><p>This study will compare 3 combined chemotherapy regimens: AC followed by paclitaxel plus trastuzumab and lapatinib, AC followed by paclitaxel plus lapatinib, and AC followed by paclitaxel plus trastuzumab given before surgery to patients with HER2-positive breast cancer.</p><p>Tumor samples were collected prior to and post-treatment, and RNA sequencing was performed with this version. </p><p> </p>","Lisa Carey, MD",24095300;38546612,R01CA229409,Case Set;Clinical Trial,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE234519,ERBB2,,245.0,272.0,HMB-NPU,RNA-Seq,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs003275,nan,nan,2a32d598-a245-484b-b7ff-f1d6a6825575,dbGaP

Intratumoral tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) have been associated with rare long-term PDAC survivors, but the role of TLS in PDAC and their spatial relationships within the context of the broader tumor microenvironment remain unknown. Here, spatial transcriptomics data were generated from 16 pancreatic cancer patients treated with GVAX, whose tumors presented with induced intratumoral TLS. Resected tumor specimens were embedded in OCT media and freshly frozen. Sections were cut into 6.5 x 6.5 mm dimensions compatible with Visium spatial transcriptomics slides. TLS-positive tumor sections from 14 patients (14 tumor samples in total) and lymph nodes from remaining patients (2 lymph node samples in total) were selected by an expert pathologist for profiling. We used 4 Visium slides and covered the 16 capture areas with sections cut in a cryostat at 10 &#181;m. The fresh frozen Visium protocol was followed according to manufacturer's recommendations (10x Genomics Spatial 3' v1). Tissue permeabilization and library construction was carried out according to the manufacturer's protocols. Permeabilization time was optimized to 30 minutes. The captured tissue sections were permeabilized to allow RNA to be captured onto the slide where it reverse-transcribed to cDNA. The cDNA was then amplified, and sequencing libraries were prepared using the 10x Genomics Visium Spatial Gene Expression Reagent Kit for Library Preparation. The libraries were then sequenced using an Illumina NovaSeq sequencer. The raw data obtained from the sequencing were processed using the SpaceRanger (spaceranger-1.2.0) pipeline for alignment onto the GRCh38-2020-A reference transcriptome quantification of gene expression. Unsupervised learning generated a TLS-specific spatial gene expression signature that significantly associates with improved survival in PDAC patients.

Patients were randomized to atezolizumab neoadjuvant and concurrent (Arm A) or concurrent with CRT (Arm B). The study closed to successful accrual of 36 evaluable patients in June 2020. Out of 40 patients consented patients, 4 were never treated. The reasons for that are: 2 were screen failures, 1 withdrew consent, and 1 was not treated due to physician preference. The study incorporated comprehensive collection of pre- and on-treatment tumor biopsies as well as multitime point blood collections. T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing was performed on the tumors as well as pre- and on-treatment peripheral blood, and the data are included with dbGaP submission. Among the 36 eligible and treated patients, there were 30 (17 on Arm A and 13 on Arm B) with pre- and on-treatment peripheral TCR sequencing data. Twenty-five patients (14 in Arm A and 11 in Arm B) had additional tumor TCR sequencing data available, which enabled tracking of tumor-associated TCR clones in peripheral blood. We demonstrate that neoadjuvant atezolizumab administration results in peripheral expansion of higher proportion of tumor-associated TCR clones in Arm A than in Arm B and is associated with favorable 2-year disease-free survival (DFS). No new safety signals were identified. These findings support further evaluation of the neoadjuvant IO and CRT sequencing strategy in locally advanced cervical cancer. </p>",Dmitriy Zamarin,,,Clinical Trial;Sequencing,,,"Genes, T-Cell Receptor beta;Radiobiology",36.0,114.0,GRU-COL,Seq_RNA_Expression,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs003833,nan,nan,88e97a97-46bc-4b4b-8bcf-1758d2f96ffc,dbGaP

However, whether such responses can target cancer driver mutations, lead to immune recognition of a patient's tumor, and result in clinical activity are largely unknown, particularly in patients with lower mutation burden tumors. We conducted a phase I trial testing a neoantigen-targeting PCV in patients with high-risk, fully resected clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC; stage III or IV), with or without ipilimumab administered adjacent to the vaccine. At a median follow-up of 40.2 months from surgery, none of the 9 initial participants experienced a recurrence of RCC. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed. All patients generated T cell immune responses against PCV antigens, including RCC driver mutations in <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7428"" target=""_blank"">VHL</a><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7428"" target=""_blank""></a>, <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/55193"" target=""_blank"">PBRM1</a>, <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8314"" target=""_blank"">BAP1</a>, <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8242"" target=""_blank"">KDM5C</a>, and <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5290"" target=""_blank"">PIK3CA</a>. Following vaccination, there was a durable expansion of peripheral T cell clones, and T cell reactivity against autologous tumor was detected in 7 of the 9 patients. Our results demonstrate that neoantigen-targeting PCVs in high-risk RCC are highly immunogenic, capable of targeting key driver mutations, and induce anti-tumor immunity. These observations, in conjunction with the absence of recurrence in all 9 vaccinated patients, highlights the promise of PCV as effective adjuvant therapy in RCC. </p><p>We are submitting WES data from whole blood samples and tumor FFPE samples, and RNA-Seq data from tumor FFPE samples.

Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies, such as trastuzumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Lapatinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

Knowing the mechanism behind a patient's response, or the lack thereof, will help us depart from the oversimplified &#8220;more-is-better&#8221; and &#8220;one-size-fits-all&#8221; principles according to which DNA-damaging agents are administered. This will improve clinical outcome by allowing us to pinpoint those who would respond better and longer to lower doses than to higher doses of DNA-damaging agents. Under the assumption that the success of DNA-damaging therapy increases with the proliferation rate of a relatively homogeneous tumor population, there was little reason to assume anything other than monotonic dose-response relations. With the recent paradigm shift that most cancers are in fact DNA mosaic products of ongoing evolution, comes the urgency to reconsider these fundamental principles behind DNA-damaging therapy administration. </p><p>As the developers of one of the first DNA deconvolution methods and with access to technologies to profile the transcriptomes of up to 10,000 cells simultaneously, we are equipped to embark on first personalized dose-finding strategies for DNA-damaging therapies. We will test the potential of the very long-term legacy that DNA-damage entails on a cell &#8220;genomic instability&#8221; as new biomarker of DNA-damage response. Our preliminary studies showed that, for most cancer types, DNA-damaging agents change a clone's genomic instability and that clones succumb to a limit in the amount of genomic instability they can tolerate. In particular, our results showed that patients with intermediate genomic instability have a very poor outcome and that this relation is only evident among treatment-naive patients, but not among patients treated with DNA-damaging agents. Further they show that we can measure genomic instability per clone and that clones with extreme genomic instability typically don't grow large. </p><p>Our hypothesis that genomic instability, rather than proliferation rate, determines how sensitive a tumor is to DNA-damaging agents on the long-term, is founded on two unexpected findings.</p><ol type=""I""><li> Patients with extremely high genomic instability per tumor clone have an exceptionally good outcome. Aim 1 will integrate exome- and single cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) data to characterize clones and to measure how much genomic instability they can tolerate. </li><li>Low genomic instability is associated with reduced benefit from DNA-damaging agents. Aim 2 will use comet assays and treatment history to quantify DNA damage per clone, relating it to the clones' ability to tolerate DNA damage and to changes in the genomic instability of therapy-surviving clones. <br></li></ol>","Noemi Andor, PhD",28432052;26618723,1K99CA215256-01;P30-CA76292,Case Set,,IDH1;IDH2,Astrocytoma,,,nan,nan,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs003762,nan,nan,f2dfc6f7-8517-484b-b6ee-9a86d5c77754,dbGaP

The environmental risk factors associated with OSCC are quite different in Taiwan as compared to other populations. In most non-Taiwanese populations, OSCC is often associated with tobacco chewing, cigarette smoking, alcohol drinking, or human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. In Taiwan, in contrast, the OSCC occurs mainly in males aged 30 years or older who have habitual betel nut chewing, cigarette smoking, and alcohol drinking. To uncover molecular mechanisms and identify new therapeutic strategies of oral squamous cell carcinoma, this study recruited 112 treatment-na&#239;ve OSCC patients and generated multi-omics data, including WES, RNA-Seq, TMT-labeled proteomes, and phosphoproteomes from paired normal/tumor tissues. We have investigated our multi-omics data, covering molecular characterizations such as mutation signatures, impacts of mutations on RNA/protein/phosphoprotein, RNA-protein correlation, somatic copy number alteration, and the relationship with RNA &amp; protein, proteome, and phosphoproteome analysis (T vs NAT), novel peptides (somatic variants, neoantigens, CT antigens, T cell receptors, etc.), as well as molecular subtyping (&amp; pathway analysis). Notably, we have discovered a higher frequency of <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/9582"" target=""_blank"">APOBEC3B</a> deletion polymorphism in the Taiwanese population, and <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/200315"" target=""_blank"">APOBEC3A</a> is a potential prognostic biomarker.

Therefore, the patients with high EGFR and low APOBEC3A expression may benefit from anti-EGFR therapy, while those with low EGFR and high APOBEC3A expression may benefit from immunotherapy.

We sought to learn more about early events of carcinogenesis by investigating shifts in the gut microbiota of patients with adenomas.</p> <p><b>Methods:</b> We analyzed 16S rRNA gene sequences from the fecal microbiota of patients with adenomas (n=233) and without (n=547).</p> <p><b>Results:</b> Multiple taxa were significantly more abundant in patients with adenomas, including Bilophila, Desulfovibrio, pro-inflammatory bacteria in the genus Mogibacterium, and multiple Bacteroidetes species. Patients without adenomas had greater abundances of Veillonella, Firmicutes (Order Clostridia), and Actinobacteria (family Bifidobacteriales). Many of our findings were consistent with previously reported shifts in the gut microbiota of CRC patients. Importantly, the altered adenoma profile is predicted to increase primary and secondary bile acid production, as well as starch, sucrose, lipid, and phenylpropanoid metabolism. </p> <p><b>Conclusions:</b> These data suggest that diets rich in refined sugar, protein, and lipids may lead to increased bile acid production, creating a colonic environment that promotes the growth of bile-tolerant microbes such as Bilophilia and Desulfovibrio.

In previous studies, we identified E2F4 as a key regulator of colorectal cancer (CRC) resistance to irinotecan (CPT-11), a cytotoxic agent that stands at the backbone of multiple chemotherapy regimens for the treatment of metastatic CRCs. The molecular mechanisms linking E2F4 to irinotecan resistance, however, remain poorly understood. The present study was designed to identify which genes are under the transcriptional control of E2F4, either at baseline or following exposure to SN38 (i.e., the active metabolite of irinotecan, generated in vivo by biotransformation in the liver) in order to clarify the role played by E2F4 in shaping colon cancer resistance to chemotherapy. The cell line used for this study (HT29) is aneuploid and contains three copies of the E2F4 gene, because of a trisomy of chromosome 16, where the E2F4 gene is located (Kawai et al., Genes, Chromosomes &#38; Cancer, 34:1-8, 2002; PMID: <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11921276/"" target=""_blank"">11921276</a>). HT29 cells were infected with lentivirus vectors encoding for CRISPR/Cas9 constructs designed to selectively inactivate the E2F4 gene, using three distinct guide-RNAs (gRNAs), each targeting a different sequence within the proximal exons of the E2F4 gene (exon 1, exon 2). Lentivirus-infected cells were sub-cloned by single-cell fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), based on the differential expression of a fluorescent reporter (EGFP) expressed in tandem with the gRNAs. Isogenic clones (EGFP+) were then screened to identify those with a tri-allelic knock-out, as revealed by both genetic sequencing of the E2F4 gene (revealing the presence of three distinct frameshift mutations) and Western blot (revealing complete loss of E2F4 protein expression). The study includes twelve (n=12) RNA-seq experiments, representative of 3 experimental replicates (i.e., three distinct isogenic clones of the HT29 cell line, each displaying complete loss of E2F4 expression) and 3 negative controls (i.e., three independent preparations of the parent HT29 cell line, infected with a lentivirus vector encoding for a non-targeting gRNA) exposed to 2 distinct in vitro cell culture conditions: a) treatment with SN38 resuspended in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO); or b) treatment with DMSO alone (negative control). The in vitro treatment regimen used for SN38 (32 nM, 24 hours) was designed so that the exposure to SN38 experienced in vitro by HT29 cells would mirror the exposure to SN38 experienced in vivo by malignant tissues, as measured, for example, in metastatic CRC patients receiving a standard dose of irinotecan (180 mg/m2) administered by intravenous infusion over 90 minutes (Deyme et al., Cancer Chemotherapy and Pharmacology, 88:247-258, 2021; PMID: <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33912999/"" target=""_blank"">33912999</a>). </p>","Piero Dalerba, MD",11921276;33912999,DRR-44-16;Schaefer Scholar Research Program;P30 CA013696;UL1 TR001873,Marker Discovery;RNA Sequencing;Tumor,,E2F4;TFDP1;RBL2;LIN9;LIN52;LIN54;LIN37;RBBP4;RBL1,Antineoplastic Agents;Irinotecan,1.0,12.0,GRU,RNA-Seq,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs003560,nan,nan,9d94cafe-9940-4f17-9ab4-1b46805e6184,dbGaP

Our study revealed that a compound targeting all three proteins, NEO2734, exhibited efficacy in suppressing the growth of organoids from both AR-positive and AR-null tumors, as evidenced by alterations in viability, size, and cellular composition. Furthermore, NEO2734 treatment consistently led to transcriptional downregulation of cell cycle pathways across various models. </p><p>In the context of neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC), NEO2734 demonstrated notable efficacy.

Defining Focal Neuroendocrine Differentiation as a Transcriptionally Distinct Form of Prostate Cancer Pathology Characterized by the Expression of Androgen Receptors</b></p><p>The study aimed to understand the transcriptional differences among different neuroendocrine pathologies of prostate cancer. The study hypothesized that the diverse neuroendocrine pathology observed in prostate might be attributable to differences in transcriptional level that remain hidden in bulk RNA-Seq data. </p><p>To investigate, we employed scRNA-seq to generate gene expression profiles of 18,632 individual tumor cells from 9 PDX models representing five distinct neuroendocrine pathologies of prostate cancer. Our analysis identified 3-8 transcriptionally distinct sub-populations per PDX. The expression of key oncogenic signaling pathways and master regulator activity varied across in neuroendocrine pathologies, with each type of pathology displaying a unique set of transcriptional sub-populations. We discovered that, like the amphicrine pathology, focal neuroendocrine differentiation (focal NED) cells maintain androgen receptor (AR) signaling. However, the expression profiles of focal NED cells differed from the other pathologies, indicating it should be considered as a distinct type of neuroendocrine pathology in prostate cancer. Analysis of copy number alterations suggested little clonal divergence between focal NED cells and neighboring adenocarcinoma cells, emphasizing the transcriptional distinctiveness of focal NED.</p><p>Overall, the findings suggest potential differences in treatment approaches for tumors from prostate cancer patients showing neuroendocrine pathology, especially focal NED.</p><p><b>4. Reprogramming of Androgen Receptor Activity in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer is Shaped by Truncated Variants.</b></p><p>Under the influence of treatments that target the androgen receptor (AR) axis, prostate cancer cells undergo various changes to the <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/367"" target=""_blank"">AR</a> gene. This includes the production of truncated AR variants that lack the ligand binding domain and are constitutively active. However, the exact role of these truncated variants in shaping the AR signaling axis and their importance in therapy resistance is not yet fully understood. By examining the AR cistrome in a group of patient-derived prostate cancer models with different mechanisms of castration resistance, we observed diverse changes in AR activity in metastatic prostate cancer, including castration-resistant models. Specifically, we identified a unique subset of tumors characterized by the expression of ARv567es, a variant resulting from structural rearrangements of the AR gene. Tumors positive for ARv567es showed a distinct AR binding profile and epigenome compared to those without ARv567es, which was linked to an altered transcriptional profile. The presence of ARv567es is associated with poor responses to treatments, such as castration and bipolar androgen therapy (BAT), regardless of the presence of full-length AR. This involves disruption of the autoregulatory loop that controls AR gene transcription and reduced transcriptional responses to treatment. Overall, this study demonstrates that ARv567es can lead to transcriptional reprogramming in advanced prostate cancer and drive therapy resistance. </p><p><b>5.

This collection includes 59 tumors from 30 patients, gathered between 2012 and 2020, aligning with the availability of abiraterone and enzalutamide in the clinic. The PDXs cover the clinical, pathological, and genomic spectrum of prostate cancer, ranging from treatment-na&#239;ve primary tumors to castration-resistant metastases. We characterized heterogeneity in adenocarcinoma and neuroendocrine phenotypes using bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing. Additionally, organoids were cultured from PDXs, enhancing our preclinical study capabilities. Employing a 1x1x1 design, we quickly identified tumors with responses to combination therapies. To manage the distribution of PDXs, we established the Melbourne Urological Research Alliance (MURAL). This PDX collection significantly enhances our ability to test and prioritize effective treatments for future clinical trials in prostate cancer.</p><p><b>6. Prostate Cancer Associated Fibroblasts Have Distinct Morpho-Mechanical Features That Are Associated With Patient Outcome.</b></p><p>The tumor stroma, including cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), has a crucial role in tumor progression. This study focused on the morphological and mechanical properties of CAFs and normal prostatic fibroblasts. The findings revealed that CAFs had distinct morphological and mechanical characteristics compared to normal fibroblasts, such as differences in nuclear size, shape, F-actin arrangement, cellular volumes, and elasticity. Additionally, the study correlated these biophysical properties with transcriptomic data, identifying pathways and cellular components linked to the observed changes. Overall, high-throughput assessments of biophysical properties in prostate cancer cells and stromal components may serve as predictive tools for patient outcomes and help identify new therapeutic approaches targeting the tumor stroma. </p><p><b><br></b></p><p><b> </b></p><p><b> </b></p><p><b> </b></p><p><b> </b></p><p><b> </b></p><p><b> </b></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>","Renea A.

How mutations of this chromatin modifier impact the epigenetic landscape to promote carcinogenesis is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that KDM6A loss triggers an epigenomic switch that disrupts urothelial identity and induces a neoplastic state characterized by increased cell proliferation. In bladder cancer cells with intact KDM6A, <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3169"" target=""_blank"">FOXA1</a> binds KDM6A at enhancers to activate genes instructing urothelial differentiation.

While topoisomerase 1 (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7150"" target=""_blank"">TOP1</a>) activity is essential for removing DNA supercoiling, aberrant stabilization of TOP1:DNA cleavage complexes (TOP1ccs) can result in cytotoxic single-stranded DNA lesions (SSLs). What protects the genome from aberrant TOP1 activity remains unknown. Using a combination of CUT&#38;RUN and TOP1 Covalent Adduct Detection (CAD) Seq in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells (<a href=""https://www.atcc.org/"" target=""_blank"">American Type Culture Collection</a>, ATCC), we identified chromatin context as an essential means to ensure TOP1cc resolution at TOP1 hot spots. Through its ability to bind poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR), a protein modification required for TOP1cc repair, the histone variant macroH2A1.1 establishes a TOP1-permissive chromatin environment, while the alternatively spliced macroH2A1.2 isoform is unable to bind PAR or protect from TOP1ccs. MacroH2A1 isoform-specific analyses were based on reconstitution of macroH2A1.1 knockout cells with wild-type or PAR binding-deficient FLAG-tagged macroH2A1.1 in human breast cancer cells. Mechanistically, we find that macroH2A1.1 facilitates the recruitment of the TOP1cc repair factor <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7515"" target=""_blank"">XRCC1</a> in response to both endogenous and drug-induced topological stress. Impaired macroH2A1.1 splicing, a frequent cancer feature, was predictive of increased sensitivity to TOP1 poisons in a pharmaco-genomic screen in breast cancer cells, and macroH2A1.1 inactivation mirrored this effect in breast and ovarian cancer cells. Consistent with this, low macroH2A1.1 expression correlated with improved survival in cancer patients treated with TOP1 inhibitors (TOP1i).

The goal of the HCMI is to generate approximately 1000 novel human ""next generation"" tumor-derived models as a community resource. The models aim to faithfully recapitulate the cellular complexity and heterogeneity of human tumors. The CMDCs are tasked by the NCI with producing a proportion of the cancer models. Wellcome Sanger Institute (WSI) is a contributing member of the HCMI.</p> <p>Models developed by HCMI are being derived from a number of tumor types and subtypes (see below), including rare adult, pediatric and understudied cancers. The number of models and the clinical sites from which patient samples are acquired is increasing. Normal tissue, originating tumor, and tumor-derived models are sequenced.</p> <p>The next generation cancer models are associated with rich clinical and genomic data through the NCI Genomic Data Commons for all researchers to advance cancer research.

B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) is the most common type of pediatric leukemia. Recent studies using transcriptional profiling of large cohorts of pediatric B-ALL have shown that patients can be grouped into transcriptional subtypes that are often defined by specific driver mutations. Interestingly, many of these mutational subtypes are defined by gene fusions or rearrangements that drive altered expression of transcription factors (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2120"" target=""_blank"">ETV6</a>-<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/861"" target=""_blank"">RUNX1</a>, <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5079"" target=""_blank"">PAX5</a>, <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/100288687"" target=""_blank"">DUX4</a>, <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6929"" target=""_blank"">TCF3</a>-<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5087"" target=""_blank"">PBX1</a>, <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/171017"" target=""_blank"">ZNF384</a>) or in chromatin regulatory machinery (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4297"" target=""_blank"">KMT2A</a>), suggesting that transcriptional dysregulation is a major driver of B-ALL. While the transcriptional distinctions are clear, the relationship between patients in terms of their chromatin regulatory landscape remains unclear. To address this, we profiled gene expression, open chromatin, and 3D genome folding in patient derived B-ALL samples. </p><p>We identified that at the level of 3D genome organization, many chromatin interactions and looping events are shared across mutational subtypes, suggesting that shared transcriptional programs, in addition to group specific driver mutations, possibly regulate the chromatin landscape in B-ALL. Using RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data, we were able to identify ""latent"" signatures of expression related to non-mutant transcription factors (TFs) that also contribute to expression heterogeneity across TF subtypes. These are related to patient specific patterns of 3D genome folding, and in some cases, are predictive of disease outcomes. This study helps shed light on the chromatin landscape in B-ALL and furthers our understanding of the interactions between diverse mutant TFs that drive B-ALL and non-mutant TFs that help shape the B-ALL chromatin landscape.</p>",Jesse Dixon;Graham McVicker;Dennis Kuo,,,Aggregate Genomic Data;Case Set;Epigenetics;Genotype/Expression;RNA Sequencing;Transcriptome Analysis;Transcriptome Sequencing;Tumor,,ETV6;RUNX1;PAX5;DUX4;TCF3;KMT2A;PBX1;ZNF384,,53.0,139.0,HMB-MDS,Hi-C;Seq_DNA_Chromatin;Seq_RNA_Expression_SC;Seq_RNA_Expression;Seq_DNA_Chromatin_SC;RNA-Seq;ATAC-seq,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs003226,nan,nan,e085e142-cbe0-4745-aa55-6958f41ac9d5,dbGaP

Despite their relative rarity, the years of potential life lost due to brain tumors in 2009 was estimated at 47,631 years for children and adolescents aged 0-19 in the United States; this is a disproportionate amount of life lost compared to adult cancers and represents an unrecognized societal threat.

Clinical course timepoints, patient demographics, stage, grade, nodal involvement, resection margins, and angiolymphatic invasion were provided as deidentified data by the OHSU cancer registry with quality control data verification in a subset by pathologists (BB and TM). We reviewed all available computed tomography (CT) scans for all patients with primary tumor resection dates recorded by the cancer registrar, with tumor samples analyzed by RNA-seq, DNA-seq, or TCR-seq, and/or with additional information indicating metastatic spread (e.g., metastatic samples received for related studies). We abstracted the site of all lesions proven to be metastatic by biopsy and/or that clearly increased in size during progression or decreased in size during treatment as long as a radiologist described the lesion as &#8220;likely&#8221;, &#8220;suspicious for&#8221;, &#8220;concerning for&#8221;, or &#8220;favor&#8221; metastasis. Clinical imaging was reviewed by a radiologist (AG) to validate patient assignments to the liver, lung, and neither liver nor lung (other recurrence site) cohorts.

We seek to understand if enhancing the Fc-region affinity of anti-CTLA-4 antibodies can improve anti-tumor efficacy and expand clinical benefit to tumors poorly responsive to conventional immunotherapy. As part of an ongoing open-label, Phase 1, multicenter study, we conducted an exploratory sub-analysis of genomics data. The primary study evaluates the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of botensilimab monotherapy and in combination with an anti-PD-1 antibody (balstilimab) in participants with advanced solid tumors. RNA from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor biopsies and matched normal blood samples were isolated and subjected to RNA-sequencing using the Personalis ImmunoID NeXT Platform. We demonstrated that anti-CTLA-4 engineered for enhanced Fc&#947;R affinity leverages Fc&#947;R-dependent mechanisms to potentiate T cell responsiveness, reduce intratumoral Tregs, and enhance antigen presenting cell activation. This genomic analysis contributes to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying patient responses to Fc-engineered anti-CTLA-4 therapy and may inform future strategies to expand the clinical benefit of immune checkpoint blockade in cancer immunotherapy.</p>","Dhan Chand, PhD",39083809,,Clinical Trial;Genotype/Expression;Individual-Level Genomic Data;RNA Sequencing;Tumor,,CCL5;CD27;CD274;CD276;CD8A;CMKLR1;CXCL10;CXCL9;CXCR6;HLA-DQA1;HLA-DRA;HLA-DRB1;HLA-E;IDO1;IFNG;LAG3;NKG7;PDCD1LG2;PSMB10;STAT1;TIGIT,Colorectal Neoplasms;Ovarian Neoplasms;Sarcoma;Melanoma;Renal Cell Carcinoma;Head and Neck Neoplasms,70.0,95.0,GRU-NPU,RNA-Seq,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs003704,nan,nan,fe2b4656-27fa-4d80-a8e3-c6cab02d5b46,dbGaP

Here, we describe a cell-free DNA (cfDNA) fragmentomic approach which distinguishes non-malignant, pre-malignant and malignant forms of NF1 PNST. Using plasma samples from a novel cohort of 101 NF1 patients and 21 healthy controls, we validated that our previous cfDNA copy number alteration (CNA)-based approach identifies malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) but cannot distinguish among benign and premalignant states. We therefore investigated the ability of fragment-based cfDNA features to differentiate NF1-associated tumors including binned genome-wide fragment length ratios, end motif analysis, and non-negative matrix factorization deconvolution of fragment lengths. Fragmentomic methods were able to differentiate pre-malignant states including atypical neurofibromas (AN). Fragmentomics also adjudicated AN cases suspicious for MPNST, correctly diagnosing samples noninvasively, which could have informed clinical management. Overall, this study pioneers the early detection of malignant and premalignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors in NF1 patients using plasma cfDNA fragmentomics. In addition to screening applications, this novel approach distinguishes atypical neurofibromas from benign plexiform neurofibromas and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, enabling more precise clinical diagnosis and management.</p>","Jack F.

To address these questions, we performed haplotype-specific analyses of chrX rearrangements in tRCC whole genomes. We show that TFE3 fusions universally arise as reciprocal translocations and that oncogenic TFE3 fusions can arise from chrXi:autosomal translocations. Female-specific chrXi:autosomal translocations result in a 2:1 female-to-male ratio of TFE3 fusions involving autosomal partner genes and account for the female predominance of tRCC.

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 4 treatment-na&#239;ve CLL patients were treated ex vivo with 0.5 &#956;M OPN5 or equivalent vehicle (DMSO) in the presence of T-cell activating stimuli (10 &#956;g/mL anti-CD3 and 5 &#956;g/mL anti-CD28) for 16 hours. Live CD8+ T-cells were then isolated via fluorescence-activated cell sorting, and approximately 100,000 viable CD8+ T-cells were subjected to ATAC-sequencing. Libraries were prepared using the Active Motif ATAC-seq kit and underwent paired-end sequencing (2 x 50 bp, 100 cycles) on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 SP sequencer. Analysis of this data revealed that OPN5 treatment induces a unique chromatin landscape in CLL patient T-cells that is less like that of terminally exhausted T-cells and more like that of effector and memory T-cells.

Standard salvage chemotherapy and donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) have little curative potential. Previous studies showed that natural killer (NK) cells can be stimulated <i>ex vivo</i> with interleukin-12 (IL-12), IL-15, and IL-18 to generate memory-like (ML) NK cells with enhanced anti-leukemia responses. We treated nine pediatric/YA patients with post-HCT relapsed AML with donor ML NK cells on a phase I trial. Patients received fludarabine, cytarabine, and filgrastim followed two weeks later by infusion of DLI and ML NK cells from the original HCT donor. ML NK cells were successfully generated from haploidentical, matched-related and matched-unrelated donors. Following infusion, donor-derived ML NK cells expanded and maintained ML multidimensional mass cytometry phenotype for over 3 months. Furthermore, ML NK cells exhibited persistent functional responses as evidenced by leukemia-triggered IFN-gamma production. Following DLI and ML NK cell adoptive transfer, 4 of 8 evaluable patients achieved complete remission at day 28. Two patients maintained a durable remission for over 3 months with one patient in remission for greater than two years. No significant toxicity was experienced. This study demonstrates that in a compatible immune environment post-HCT, donor ML NK cells robustly expand and persist with potent anti-leukemic activity in the absence of exogenous cytokines. ML NK cells in combination with DLI present a novel immunotherapy platform for AML that has relapsed after allogeneic HCT. This trial was registered at <a href=""https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03068819"" target=""_blank"">https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03068819</a>.</p><p><b>A Phase II Study of Cytokine Induced Memory-like NK Cell Adoptive Therapy after Haploidentical Donor Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation</b> (<a href=""https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=NCT02782546"" target=""_blank"">NCT02782546</a>)</p><p>Natural killer (NK) cells are innate lymphoid cells that eliminate cancer cells, produce cytokines, and are being investigated as a nascent cellular immunotherapy. Impaired NK cell function, expansion, and persistence remain key challenges for optimal clinical translation. One promising strategy to overcome these challenges is cytokine-induced memory-like (ML) differentiation, whereby NK cells acquire enhanced anti-tumor function following stimulation with IL-12, IL-15, and IL-18. Here, reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) for HLA-haploidentical hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) was augmented with same-donor ML NK cells on Day 7 and 3 weeks of N-803 (IL-15 superagonist) to treat patients with relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in the clinical trial (<a href=""https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=NCT02782546"" target=""_blank"">NCT02782546</a>). In 15 patients, donor ML NK cells were well-tolerated and 87% of patients achieved a composite complete response at Day 28, which corresponded with clearing high-risk mutations, including TP53 variants. NK cells were the major blood lymphocytes for two months post-HCT with prolific expansion (1104-fold) over 1-2 weeks. Multidimensional mass cytometry and CITE-seq identified donor ML NK cells as distinct from conventional NK cells and persisting for over two months. ML NK cells expressed CD16, CD57, and high granzyme B and perforin, along with a unique transcription factor profile. ML NK cells differentiated in patients had enhanced <i>ex vivo</i> function compared to conventional NK cells from both patient and healthy donors. Overall, same-donor ML NK cell therapy with 3 weeks of N-803 support safely augmented RIC haplo-HCT for AML, with ML NK cells demonstrating enhanced <i>in vivo</i> persistence and functionality, overcoming barriers in the field.</p>",,35196021;34871371,"P50CA171963;T32GM139799;K12CA167540;U01CA248235;T32HL00708843;R01CA205239;T32HL007088;F30AI16131;Children's Discovery Institute;Intersect Fellowship Program for Computational Scientists and Immunologists;American Society of Hematology Scholar Award;Gabrielle's Angel Foundation Award;St. Louis Children's Hospital Foundation;V Scholar Award V2018-007;Alvin J.

To prospectively assess microbiome changes prior to colorectal neoplasia, we investigated samples from 100 Lynch syndrome patients using 16S rRNA gene sequencing of colon biopsies, coupled with metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequencing of feces. Colectomy and CRC history represented the largest effects on microbiome profiles. A subset of Clostridiaceae were depleted in stool corresponding with baseline adenomas, while Desulfovibrio was enriched in both stool and mucosal biopsies. A classifier leveraging stool metatranscriptomes resulted in modest power to predict interval development of preneoplastic colonic adenoma. Predictive transcripts corresponded with a shift in flagellin contributors and oxidative metabolic microenvironment, potentially factors in local CRC pathogenesis.

More than 90% of children are cured with a combination of multiple chemotherapeutic drugs. Some may suffer from debilitating toxicities due to the cytotoxic drugs, necessitating pharmacogenetic research to search for genetic markers predictive of treatment toxicities, so that treatment can be better tailored based on patients' genetic makeup. Bone toxicities, including osteonecrosis and fractures, most often due to glucocorticoids, are the most common complications in ALL, which have long-lasting detrimental impact on the still developing skeletons in children. In DFCI ALL Consortium Protocol 05-001, a multi-center clinical trial for childhood ALL conducted in Canada and the US, we found that Hispanic children had less drug toxicities to their bones than non-Hispanic children. Although reasons for the observed ethnic differences are largely unknown, patients' inherited genetic background may be at play.

Tumors are rarely resected, which is a major barrier to molecular profiling of tumor tissue; therefore, non-invasive approaches using circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) from liquid biopsies are needed to help advance research and clinical care for patients with SCLC. We developed a targeted capture panel that profiles SCLC genes and transcriptional regulation sites, including transcription start sites (TSS) and transcription factor binding sites (TFBS). This is a single assay that detects genomic mutations and transcriptional regulation activity based on ctDNA fragment patterns reflecting epigenetic nucleosomal positions. We applied this assay to sequence patient-derived xenograft (PDX) and patient plasma samples.

To uncover the molecular changes that occur in the 3D structure of cancer genomes, we integrated topological maps for colon tumors and normal colon tissues with epigenetic, transcriptional, and imaging data. We characterized tumor-associated changes in chromatin loops, topologically associated domains (TADs), and large-scale compartments. We found that chromatin loop rewiring contributes to oncogenic gene expression programs. Whereas TAD structures are largely stable, the spatial partitioning of the open and closed genome compartments is compromised in tumors and is accompanied by hypomethylation and histone mark rearrangements. We also identified a compartment that is reorganized in tumors and is at the interface between the canonical A and B compartments. Similar changes were evident in non-malignant cells that had accumulated excessive cellular divisions. Our analyses suggest that these compartment changes repress stemness and invasion programs while inducing immunity genes, and they may therefore restrain malignant progression.","Bradley E.

Since 2007, common genetic variants in ~200 loci have been identified in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in relation to breast cancer risk. However, it is often difficult to translate GWAS findings to disease prevention and treatment since causal genes in the large majority of GWAS-identified loci are unknown. Furthermore, a large fraction of breast cancer heritability remains unexplained. Recent studies suggest that nearly 80% of disease heritability can be explained by genetic variants regulating gene expression. </p><p>Herein, we propose three well-powered transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) to systematically investigate the association of breast cancer risk with gene expression across the transcriptome of African, Asian and European descendants. In Aim 1, we will perform RNA sequencing and high-density genotyping assays using normal breast tissue samples, and build race-specific gene expression prediction models using data from 1000 women of African, Asian and European descent. These models will be applied to the GWAS data generated from approximately 320,000 breast cancer patients and controls to impute gene expression for association analyses of predicted gene expression with risk of breast cancer overall, and by estrogen receptor and <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2064"" target=""_blank"">HER2</a> status. In Aim 2, we will select the top 50 genes identified in Aim 1 for <i>in vitro</i> functional assays to assess their influence on major cell functions related to cancer biology. In Aim 3, we will evaluate whether TWAS-identified genes may express differently in normal breast tissues and breast cancer tissues collected from African, Asian, and European descendants to assess whether these genes may contribute to racial differences in breast cancer risk by molecular subtypes. With strong methodology and a large sample size, we believe that this proposed study should be able to identify and characterize a large number of novel genes related to breast cancer risk. Uncovering breast cancer susceptibility genes will greatly improve the understanding of the genetic and biological basis for breast cancer and accelerate the translation of genetic findings to disease prevention and patient care. </p>",Wei Zheng;Jirong Long,,,Genotype;RNA Sequencing;Tissue Expression;Transcriptome Analysis,,,,150.0,150.0,DS-BRCA-PUB-NPU-MDS,RNA-Seq;Array_SNP,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs003535,nan,nan,de9afbb9-543b-41ca-a931-123ddb73485e,dbGaP

phs003099,Integration of Clinical and Molecular Biomarkers for Melanoma Survival    (Berwick),"Biomarkers, Tumor",2024-03-21,,Not Provided,"<p>The long-term goal of the InterMEL Program Project: <i>Integration of Clinical and Molecular Biomarkers for Melanoma Survival</i> is to identify molecular and clinical factors that predict survival of melanoma patients. Our overarching hypothesis is that we can identify factors in the primary melanoma tumor that will lead to more aggressive disease. Melanoma patients diagnosed at American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) tumor, lymph nodes, and metastases (TNM) stages IIA/IIB/IIC/IIIA/IIIB/IIIC/IIID display highly variable clinical outcomes and responses to therapy. We wish to identify robust and reproducible biomarkers or sets of classifiers that distinguish patients likely to have poor prognosis. These biomarkers will help establish targets for adjuvant therapies for this set of patients before the tumors metastasize. </p><p><b>Aim 1. Classify actionable somatic mutations, and copy number variations (CNVs) in relationship to melanoma survival. </b></p><p>In Project 1,<i> Targeted Sequencing and Clinicopathology to Evaluate Primary Melanoma Molecular Subtypes and Outcomes</i>, we will profile 468 genes using the MSKIMPACT &#8482; assay and identify somatic mutations and CNVs associated with melanoma-specific survival, as well as their co-occurrence with other mutations, in 1,000 tumors from patients at AJCC TNM stages IIA-IIID: approximately 500 from patients who died with melanoma within five years and approximately 500 from individuals who have lived at least five years. We will also evaluate the joint effects of somatic mutations, CNVs and pathologic characteristics associated with good and poor outcomes. </p><p><b>Aim 2. Identify primary melanoma DNA methylation profiles to evaluate subtypes and survival. </b></p><p>Although it has been established that melanomas frequently have aberrant DNA methylation, it is unknown if DNA methylation in primary melanomas predicts outcome. In Project 2,<i> Primary Melanoma DNA Methylation Profiling for Evaluating Subtypes and Survival</i>, we will profile the same primary melanomas as in Project 1 with Illumina Infinium 850K methylation arrays. We expect to: identify and characterize DNA methylation-based melanoma subclasses; train, test and validate a CpG signature prognostic for survival from melanoma; determine whether this profile adds information to outcome prediction beyond AJCC TNM staging. This project is based on the hypothesis that DNA methylation in primary melanoma will define subgroups (including a poor-prognosis CIMP &#8211; &#8216;CpG island methylator phenotype' subtype) and that a CpG signature will be prognostic for melanoma survival. </p><p><b>Aim 3. Define microRNA expression changes in relation to melanoma survival. </b></p><p>MicroRNAs have been associated with poor prognosis in melanoma, as well as in other cancers. In Project 3, <i>Prognostic and Functional Role of a Gene Expression Signature in Melanoma Patients</i>, we hypothesize that altered miRNA expression, captured at the time of diagnosis, may contribute to the aggressive behavior of a subset of early stage primary melanomas. We will profile the same primary melanomas as in Projects 1 and 2 with a Nanostring assay. This project will define and validate a tissue-based microRNA signature in conducted to determine whether the prognostic miRNA signature, as well as other candidate genes emerging from other projects, contribute to melanoma survival. </p><p><b>Aim 4. Integrate data from multiple platforms to identify melanoma subtypes and survival. </b></p><p>Despite substantial literature on gene tumor mutation-, methylation- and gene expression-based prognostic and predictive signatures for melanoma, few such signatures are used in clinical practice. Project 4, <i>Multiplatform Analysis of Melanoma Molecular Subtypes and Patient Survival Outcome</i>, will use novel integrative clustering methods to identify molecular subtypes of melanoma jointly defined across these platforms. </p>",Marianne Berwick,,,Case-Control;Copy Number Variation (CNV);Epigenetics;Individual-Level Genomic Data;Marker Discovery;Multicenter;Sequencing;Tumor;Tumor vs. Matched-Normal,,,,697.0,697.0,GRU,Array_DNA_Methylation;Array_miRNA_Expression;Targeted-Capture,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs003099,nan,nan,52b9e038-43ca-4248-8e30-dc8d85bd8dae,dbGaP

In 2007, the study was expanded to include 8 case-control studies. The study team includes scientists from the cohorts comprising the Consortium, the NCI and the Pancreatic Cancer Case Control Consortium (PanC4).

In conjunction, a systematic genomic and transcriptomic analysis in a subset of patients (n = 29) with available tissue samples was conducted. To investigate the molecular mechanisms of AR to PD-1 blockade from pre- and/or post-treatment tumors, microarray-based whole transcriptome expression data for 29 tumor samples, and whole exome sequencing (WES) data from 34 tumor samples was generated from this subset. Microarray data was uploaded to the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. </p><p>Most AR tumors showed retained or increased inflammatory characteristics with significant upregulation of IFN&#947; which was suggestive of persistent albeit insufficient anti-tumor immune response. This finding expounds upon the prior pre-clinical and translational data supporting the intricate role of IFN&#947; in sensitivity and resistance to immunotherapy. Whereas initial IFN&#947; exposure may be fundamental to T cell activation (a hallmark of immune response), persistent IFN&#947; related effects and upregulation may potentially signal immune dysfunction and IFN&#947; insensitivity in contrast.

Allo-HSCT is associated with significant morbidities and mortality, mainly because of the graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) caused by donor T cells recognizing antigens present in recipient tissues, and initiating an alloimmune response resulting in damage to many organs including the skin, gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and liver in recipient. More than half of all Allo-HSCT recipients develop different degrees of GVHD (grades I-IV). About 20% of recipients develop severe GVHD (grades III-IV) that is associated with a very high morbidity and mortality. The most important factor determining the severity of GVHD is the genetic disparities between donors and recipients, as is reflected in human leukocyte antigen (HLA) haplotypes that are routinely checked for donor selection. Even when donors and recipients are HLA-identical, many recipients develop severe GVHD. As a result, non-HLA antigens are important determinants of acute GVHD. An interesting and unique aspect of GVHD is that it is the consequence of an interaction between antigens present in one individual with the immune system of another individual. As a result, genotypes of both donor and recipient, and their interactions affect the pathogenesis of GVHD. To determine the genetic risk factors for GVHD, in the first aim (discovery phase), we will conduct Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) in 3,000 patients who underwent Allo-HSCT and in their respective donors (6000 DNA samples) that are provided to us by the <a href=""https://www.cibmtr.org/Pages/index.aspx"" target=""_blank"">Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR)</a>, a research collaboration between the <a href=""https://bethematch.org/about-us/global-transplant-network/standards/"" target=""_blank"">NMDP</a> and <a href=""https://www.mcw.edu/"" target=""_blank"">Medical College of Wisconsin</a>.

In the third aim, we will investigate the functional effect of SNPs detected and validated to be significantly correlated with the severity of acute GVHD in mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR), as an <i>ex vivo</i> surrogate for an alloimmune response.</p>","Vahid Afshar-Khargan, MD",,"R01CA231141;X01HG007923;HHSN268201700006I, NIH contract ""High throughput genotyping for studying the genetic contributions to human disease""",Cohort,,,"Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute;Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma;Myelodysplastic-Myeloproliferative Diseases",9408.0,9518.0,NRUP;DS-HCTCT-GSO,Array_SNP_CNV;Imputation_SNP_CNV,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs002185,nan,nan,c38e195c-ea90-4d95-9a34-8c874a08f1f9,dbGaP

The personalization of therapy for cancer will require molecular characterization of unique and shared genetic aberrations. In particular, patients who have a sarcoma or other rare cancers and are candidates for clinical trials could potentially benefit by identifying eligibility for ""targeted"" drugs based on the ""actionable"" genes in their specific tumor. Growing technological advances in genomic sequencing has now made it possible to consider the use of sequence data in a clinical setting. For instance, comprehensive testing that includes whole exome and transcriptome sequencing may identify biomarkers for predictive or prognostic purposes and thereby inform treatment choices and prevention strategies. Thus, the translation of high throughput next generation sequencing would support a ""personalized"" strategy for cancer. However, the translation of clinical sequencing bears unique challenges including identifying patients who could benefit, developing informed consent and human subjects protections, outlining measurable outcomes, interpreting what results should be reported and validated, and how results should be reported. In addition, we know very little about how patients and clinicians will respond to the potentially confusing and overwhelming amount of information generated by genomic sequencing, and we lack model processes for clinically evaluating and presenting these data. For the promise of our innovative biotechnologies to be realized, ""translational genomics"" research that evaluates genomic applications within real-world clinical settings will be required. This proposal brings together expertise at the University of Michigan including clinical oncology, cancer genetics, genomic science/bioinformatics, clinical pathology, social and behavioral sciences, and bioethics in order to implement this clinical cancer sequencing project. Three integrated Projects have the following themes: Project 1) ""Clinical Genomic Study"" will identify patients with a rare cancer (i.e., 15 out of 100,000 individuals per year) who are eligible for clinical trials, consent them to the study, obtain biospecimens (tumor tissue, germline tissue), store clinical data, and assemble a multi-disciplinary Sequencing Tumor Board to deliberate on return of actionable or incidental genomic results; Project 2) ""Sequencing &#38; Analysis"" will process biospecimens and perform comprehensive sequencing and analysis of tumors to identify point mutations, copy number changes, rearrangements/gene fusions, and aberrant gene expression; Project 3) ""Ethics &#38; Psychosocial Analysis"" will observe the expert review process for evaluating sequence results and will examine the clinician and patient response to the informed consent process, delivery of genomic sequence results, and use of genomic results.</p>","Arul Chinnaiyan, MD PhD",24185510;26325560;28783718,1UM1HG006508,Case Set,,,Breast Neoplasms;Sarcoma;Prostatic Neoplasms;Aromatase Inhibitors;Hematologic Neoplasms,1427.0,4403.0,GRU,RNA-Seq;WXS;Targeted-Capture,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000673,nan,nan,b747952e-c46b-4e9d-ac11-340f7e137940,dbGaP

Mounting evidence suggests that a genetic predisposition exists for this pediatric cancer, although the specific genetic contribution has yet to be identified. EWS has never been linked to a specific cancer predisposition syndrome, although several case reports have been published that describe siblings and cousins with EWS. Furthermore, neuroectodermal tumors appear to occur more commonly in families with EWS. The two consistent epidemiology findings in EWS include a very strong Caucasian predilection and increased rates of hernia in EWS patients and their family members. Finally, the role of genetic microsatellite repeats in EWS tumorigenesis has been recently described, and these GGAA microsatellites are polymorphic in repeat size and location across the genome.<br></p> <p>The study goals of this Kids First project include (1) To identify cancer predisposition genes in EWS trios increasing disease risk, (2) To identify genome-wide GGAA microsatellite repeats in EWS trios increasing disease risk, and (3) To identity de novo mutation and structural variant rates in EWS trios reflecting underlying DNA repair defects that increase disease risk.

phs003188,Overcoming Clinical Resistance to EZH2 Inhibition Using Rational    Epigenetic Combination Therapy,"Drug Resistance, Neoplasm",2024-01-17,,Not Provided,"<p>Essential epigenetic dependencies have become evident in many cancers. Based on functional antagonism between BAF/SWI/SNF and PRC2 in SMARCB1-deficient sarcomas, we and colleagues recently completed the clinical trial of the EZH2 inhibitor tazemetostat, leading to its FDA approval. However, the principles of tumor response to epigenetic therapy in general and tazemetostat in particular remain unknown. Using functional genomics of patient tumors and diverse experimental models, we defined molecular mechanisms of tazemetostat resistance. We found distinct classes of acquired mutations that converge on the RB1/E2F axis, decoupling EZH2-dependent differentiation and cell cycle control. This allows tumor cells to escape tazemetostat-induced G1 arrest despite EZH2 inhibition and suggests a general mechanism for effective EZH2 therapy. Using RNA-sequencing of patient tumor specimens, we identified specific genes as markers of a deficient RB1/E2F axis, which we propose as prospective biomarkers for therapy stratification. This offers a paradigm for rational epigenetic combination therapy suitable for immediate translation to clinical trials.</p><p>This study was performed on archived tumor tissue collected as part of the above clinical trial at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.

In this study, we profiled a range of tumor types, varying in cell-of-origin, solid and non-solid forms, patient ages, and transitions. The tumors also further varied in their tissue site and in their sample collection method. To enable profiling of such diverse samples, we developed a systematic toolbox for single cell RNA-Seq and single nucleus RNA-Seq of fresh and frozen clinical tumor samples. We validated this toolbox for 216,490 cells and nuclei extracted from 39 samples across 23 tumors (some tumors were split into multiple samples). The 23 tumors represented eight unique tumor types.

A strategy of using multi-epitope and personalized neoantigen vaccination has previously been tested in patients with high-risk melanoma. We demonstrated that this strategy is feasible for glioblastoma (GBM) which typically has a relatively low mutation load and an immunologically 'cold' tumor microenvironment. We conducted whole exome sequencing (WES) of tumor and normal cells from individual GBM patients to identify tumor-specific mutations. We assessed the expression of mutated alleles by RNA-sequencing of tumor, and used personalized neoantigen-targeting vaccines to immunize newly diagnosed GBM patients following surgical resection and conventional radiotherapy in a phase I/Ib study. Patients who did not receive dexamethasone, a highly potent corticosteroid that is frequently prescribed to treat cerebral oedema in GBM patients, generated circulating polyfunctional neoantigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses that were enriched in a memory phenotype and showed an increase in the number of tumor-infiltrating T cells. Using single-cell T cell receptor analysis, we provided an evidence that neoantigen-specific T cells from the peripheral blood can migrate into an intracranial GBM tumor. Neoantigen-targeting vaccines thus have the potential to favorably alter the immune environment of GBM.</p><p>In order to discover cancer antigens derived from annotated and unannotated protein-coding regions of the genome, we carried out matched ribosome profiling (Ribo-Seq) on two GBM samples.

Here we model this occult process by engineering TP53 deficiency in primary human gastric organoids and performing experimental evolution in multiple clonally derived cultures over two years, thereby defining causal relationships between this common initiating genetic lesion and resulting phenotypes. TP53 loss induced progressive aneuploidy, including copy number alterations and complex structural variants that are common in established gastric cancers, and which accrued along a defined temporal order. Longitudinal single cell sequencing of TP53 deficient gastric organoids similarly indicates progression towards malignant transcriptional programs. Moreover, lineage tracing with expressed cellular barcodes revealed highly reproducible dynamics whereby initially rare subclones with shared transcriptional programs repeatedly attain clonal dominance. This powerful platform for experimental evolution reveals stringent selection and convergence at the genotypic and phenotypic levels in pre-malignant epithelial organoids, illuminating evolutionary constraints and barriers to malignant transformation.</p>",Christina Curtis,37258665,,Copy Number Variation (CNV);Longitudinal;RNA Sequencing;Whole Genome Sequencing,,,Genomics;Gene Expression Profiling;DNA Barcoding;Organoids,3.0,193.0,HMB,RNA-Seq;AMPLICON;WGS;Seq_DNA_CNV,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs003249,nan,nan,015731ed-6f9b-4707-a067-5ba3d26c44cf,dbGaP

High-risk areas occur across central Asia and from eastern to southern Africa, and in these populations, nearly all of the cases are esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). ESCC has a dismal prognosis, largely because symptoms usually appear late in the course of the disease, when the tumors are incurable. Early detection and treatment of curable precursor lesions and early invasive ESCC in asymptomatic high-risk adults offers the potential for long-term survival and reduced mortality from this disease. Previous studies have shown that routine cytology of non-endoscopically collected esophageal cell samples is not sensitive and specific enough to be clinically useful, so we are now looking for molecular markers of high-grade esophageal squamous dysplasia (HGD), the proven clinically important precursor lesion of ESCC, that can be used to increase the accuracy and utility of this initial screening exam. <a href=""https://www.cancer.gov/"" target=""_blank"">National Cancer Institute</a> (NCI) and <a href=""https://www.thebeijinger.com/directory/cancer-institute-and-hospital"" target=""_blank"">Cancer Institute and Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences</a> (CAMS) began collaborative studies of ESCC since the mid-1980s in China.

However, its efficacy is limited by progression to castration-resistant PC (CRPC), usually due to AR re-activation via mechanisms that include AR amplification and structural rearrangement. These two classes of AR alterations often co-occur in CRPC tumors, but it is unclear whether this reflects intercellular or intracellular heterogeneity of AR. It is important to resolve the mechanisms of AR genomic rearrangements to develop new therapies and predictive biomarkers for PC. We developed a targeted linked-read DNA sequencing assay to interrogate alterations in AR and a panel of genes known to be amplified or mutated in CRPC. Linked-read DNA-sequencing libraries were generated using the 10X Genomics Chromium platform and subjected to hybridization enrichment using a custom-designed Agilent SureSelect bait panel. Post-capture DNA-seq libraries were pooled and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 using 2x150 bp settings. This targeted linked-read DNA-seq assay was used to interrogate a set of 6 benchmarking samples harboring known AR gene rearrangements and other alterations in AR, as well a panel of 6 patient-derived xenograft CRPC tumors and 23 clinical CRPC tumors.

Additionally, variations in the local spatial properties of the bulk matrix make it challenging to distinguish whether phenotypic differences between organoids stem from inherent cellular disparities or disparities in the microenvironment. To address these challenges, we have developed a microwell-based technique that facilitates the quantification of image-based parameters for organoids grown from single cells. Furthermore, these organoids can be easily retrieved from their respective microwells for molecular profiling. By employing a deep-learning image processing pipeline, we conducted a comprehensive assessment of various phenotypic traits in two CRISPR-engineered human gastric organoid models. This analysis encompassed growth rates, cellular movement, and apical-basal polarity. Through our investigation, we successfully identified genomic alterations associated with increased growth rate, as well as changes in accessibility and expression patterns correlated with apical-basal polarity.

phs003330,Uveal Melanoma Immunogenomics Predict Immunotherapy Resistance and    Susceptibility,Uveal Melanoma,2023-09-20,,Not Provided,"<p>Immunotherapy using immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) has shown success in treating metastatic cutaneous melanoma but has limited efficacy against metastatic uveal melanoma (UM), a rare variant arising from the immune privileged eye. To better understand this immune resistance, we performed comprehensive immunogenomic profiling of 100 human UM metastases using clinicogenomics, bulk and single cell transcriptomics, T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire analysis, and tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) potency assessment. We found that over half of these metastases harbored TIL with potent autologous tumor specificity, despite having low tumor mutational burden and resistance to prior immunotherapies, including ICI and the bispecific T cell engager tebentafusp. These T cell infiltrated metastases displayed activated antigen presenting cells, chronic interferon signaling, and diverse TCR repertoires. However, we observed strikingly low intratumoral TCR clonality and transcriptionally non-proliferative TIL within the tumor microenvironment even after ICI and tebentafusp therapy, demonstrating that these immunotherapies were insufficient to induce proliferation of the tumor reactive TIL. To harness the therapeutic potential of these quiescent TIL, we developed rapid tumor transcriptomic profiling to enable their selective <i>in vivo</i> identification and <i>ex vivo</i> liberation to counter their growth suppression. We demonstrate that adoptive transfer of these transcriptomic selected TIL can promote tumor immunity in patients with metastatic UM when other immunotherapies are incapable.</p><p>Data that will be available through <a href=""https://dbgap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/aa/wga.cgi?page=login"" target=""_blank"">dbGaP</a> includes raw bulk tumor transcriptomic sequencing data.</p>",Udai S.

Even though complete remission is often achieved, majority of the AML patients still relapse. Measurable residual disease (MRD), defined as the population of cancer cells which persists following chemotherapy, is responsible for AML relapse. Understanding the biology enabling MRD clones to resist therapy is necessary to guide the development of curative treatments more effectively. Discriminating residual leukemic clones, preleukemic clones, and normal precursors remains a challenge with current MRD tools. We developed a single cell MRD (scMRD) assay by combining flow cytometric enrichment of the targeted precursor/blast population with integrated single cell DNA sequencing (scDNA-seq) and immunophenotyping (<a href=""https://missionbio.com/products/platform/"" target=""_blank"">Tapestri, Missionbio</a>). The platform utilizes a custom amplicon panel covering 109 amplicons across 31 genes frequently mutated in AML and a panel of 42 oligo-conjugated antibodies against surface makers. We applied our scMRD assay to sequence 30 MRD samples (multiplexed into 6) from 29 AML patients to study the clonal architecture and protein correlation. In addition, 2 MRD samples were sequenced with scDNA+protein sequencing technology without enrichment or multiplexing. Five patients with AML at diagnosis were also sequenced with scDNA+protein sequencing technology without enrichment or multiplexing. In order to establish the sensitivity of our scMRD assay, we spiked AML cells into normal bone marrow cells. We sequenced 12 such spiked samples after multiplexing.</p>",Wenbin Xiao;Ross Levine,35797463;34724563;34258102;33116311;32150611;37729414,,Clinical Genetic Testing;Cohort;Single Cell Analysis,,ASXL1;ATM;BRAF;CALR;CBL;CHEK2;DNMT3A;EZH2;FLT3;GATA2;IDH1;IDH2;JAK2;KIT;KRAS;MPL;NPM1;NRAS;PHF6;PPM1D;PTPN11;RAD21;RUNX1;SETBP1;SF3B1;SRSF2;STAG2;TET2;TP53;U2AF1;WT1,"Neoplasm, Residual",91.0,25.0,HMB,AMPLICON,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs003233,nan,nan,08758031-e576-4266-bb07-80fb5ee38ac9,dbGaP

Similar therapy can induce long-term remissions for relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients, but in only a small subset of subjects. The determinants of response and resistance to CTL019 therapy of CLL are not fully understood. We employed next generation sequencing of RNA (RNA-seq) to identify predictive indicators of response to CTL019 treatment. We performed RNA-seq on leukapheresis and manufactured infusion product T cells from patients with heavily pre-treated and high-risk disease. To characterize potency, we also performed RNA-seq on the cellular infusion product after CAR-specific stimulation. Our findings indicate that durable remission in CLL is associated with gene expression signatures of early memory T cell differentiation (e.g., STAT3), while T cells from poorly- or non-responding patients exhibited elevated expression of key regulators of late memory as well as effector T cell differentiation, apoptosis, aerobic glycolysis, hypoxia and exhaustion. These gene expression signatures, along with additional immunological biomarkers, may be used to identify which patients are most likely to respond to cellular therapies and suggest manufacturing modifications that might potentiate the generation of maximally efficacious infusion products.</p> <p>In a follow-up study, we report multiplex CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing on T cells in humans to test the hypothesis that disrupting genes encoding the endogenous T cell receptor (TCR), TCR&#945; (TRAC) and TCR&#946; (TRBC), as well as PD-1 (PDCD1) would enhance the efficacy of autologous T cells engineered to express a transgenic NY-ESO TCR. We used single cell RNA-seq to comprehensively characterize the transcriptomic phenotype of this T cell product and its evolution over time in a patient with sarcoma. Notably, this patient's transferred T cells that persisted in vivo demonstrated increases in expression of genes associated with a central memory state (IL7R, TCF7). These findings may guide future trials involving administration of genetically redirected, genome -edited T cells.</p><p>In this follow-up study, we investigated whether CRISPR-Cas9-mediated disruption of PDCD1 and/or CTLA-4 could restore CART dysfunction in healthy donors and/or CLL patients. We show that depletion of CTLA-4 rescues the function of T cells from leukemia patients that previously failed CART cell treatment. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing and characterized the transcriptomic landscape of CTLA-4 KO CART19 cells that showed higher proliferation and anti-tumor efficacy by permitting unopposed CD28 signaling and maintenance of CAR expression on the T cell surface under stress-test conditions of chronic antigen exposure. Our findings reveal that selective disruption of CTLA-4 invigorates dysfunctional patient T cells, providing a strategy for increasing patient responses to CART cell therapy. </p>","Carl H.

Across four organ types, PCAPP's goal is to collect and profile pre-malignant lesions for gene expression, DNA mutations, single-cell gene expression and immune-environment. Most PML are small in size and only available come from formalin fixed paraffin embedded archived tissue. The primary goal of PCAPP is to 1) understand the logistical challenges of PML specimen collection, 2) document technical limitations of the assays that are specific to the PML and 3) overcome them to support the generation of a more comprehensive Pre-Cancer Atlas in the future. The current upload provides RNA and DNA sequencing from participants with DCIS who were studied at the University of San Diego and the University of Vermont. </p><p> </p><p><b>Description of the overall study: </b></p><p><b>A. Background/Significance </b></p><p>One of the critical barriers to developing new approaches for cancer detection and prevention is the lack of understanding of the key molecular and cellular changes that cause cancer initiation and progression. Unlike the extensive work that has been done profiling advanced stage tumors, few studies have comprehensively profiled the molecular alterations found in precancerous tissues. Premalignant lesions are currently characterized by histologic changes that precede the development of invasive carcinoma<sup>1,2</sup>.These lesions can often be identified in regions surrounding an invasive tumor or in biopsies taken from patients undergoing diagnostic evaluation for suspicion of cancer. Currently, limited metrics exist to identify lesions that will likely progress to carcinoma and require intervention from those that will naturally regress or remain stable<sup>3,4</sup>. Characterization of the molecular alterations in premalignant lesions and the corresponding changes in the microenvironment would hasten the development of biomarkers for early detection and risk stratification as well as suggest preventive interventions to reverse or delay the development of cancer. </p><p>Our pilot study will establish the feasibility of transcriptomic, genomic and immune profiling of FFPE premalignant lesions from multiple organ sites, collected and profiled with uniform SOPs across multiple institutions within the MCL consortium. We will characterize the molecular alterations in precancerous lesions and the corresponding microenvironment in four major organ sites, in order to uncover the molecular and cellular determinants of premalignancy, and establish standardized sequencing and immunohistochemistry protocols on FFPE precancerous tissue. We will also evaluate the technical feasibility of single nuclei sequencing of small FFPE pre-cancer lesions. Successful completion of the proposed pilot study will set the stage for expansion and development of a comprehensive Pre-Cancer Atlas (PCA) as part of the NCI's moonshot.<br></p><p><b>B.

Subsequent resected lumpectomy or mastectomy tissues will be prospectively sampled in the vicinity of the prior biopsy site using multiple approaches: 1) Live cells (heterogeneous mix) will be obtained as a cell scrape slurry from the lesion surface or by fine needle aspirate (FNA); 2) For a subset of specimens where size is sufficient, a block of breast tissue with DCIS will be fresh-frozen; 3) The remainder of the specimen will be taken for routine formalin-fixation and paraffin-embedding (FFPE). The FFPE sample will be annotated to identify the matched FFPE tissue block adjacent to the fresh-frozen sample and will be sectioned for use in bulk and single nuclei sequencing . We will dissect DCIS, adjacent normal and when available, associated carcinoma. In addition, when possible, normal tissue will be collected from a tissue block lacking lesions as well as collection of blood. A subset of patients (n = 5 | FFPE, flash frozen and fresh) will be sent to the Broad Institute for single nuclei/cell sequencing.</p><p><b><i>2.

We will study 20 patients (5 each from BU/UCLA/Vanderbilt/Moffitt) with pre-invasive squamous lesions (moderate-severe dysplasia or carcinoma in situ (CIS)) identified on pathologic examination. LCM of the premalignant region and adjacent normal epithelium will be performed as well as the invasive tumor for those collected from the resection margin (n=5 from UCLA). On a subset of lesions collected at bronchoscopy (n=5), we will collect additional biopsies that will be flash frozen and fresh for single nuclei and cell sequencing, respectively, performed at the Broad Institute. In parallel to the work at the Broad, BU will perform single cell RNA-seq on these freshly cell sorted tissues (n = 5). Blood will be collected on all patients for genomic studies. </p><p> For lung adenocarcinoma, we will collect resected FFPE lung tissues from 20 patients (10 from UCLA and 10 from Vanderbilt/Moffitt) with early stage lung adenocarcinoma that harbor atypical adenomatous (AAH) premalignant lesions in the resection margin. We will LCM multiple AAH regions (3-5 per patient) as well as adjacent regions of normal epithelium and invasive adenocarcinoma. In addition, blood will be collected on all patients for genomic studies. </p><p><b><i>3. IPMNs from <u>pancreatic</u> tissue: </i></b></p><p>For pancreatic cancer PML, we will collect low and high grade lesions from 24 patients representing macroscopic Intraductal Papillary Mucinous Neoplasms (IPMN) (n=24) from surgically resected specimens along with blood samples. Archival FFPE specimens of microscopic PanIN lesions, occurring multi-focally adjacent to invasive PDAC, and archival IPMN lesions (with or without associated invasive cancer), along with the adjacent normal tissue, will undergo LCM and utilized for bulk DNA and RNA sequencing. If matched frozen tissues are available for a subset of these FFPE samples, we will bank for comparison of profiles. Because IPMNs are macroscopic lesions, they provide an opportunity for obtaining the samples fresh and therefore can be used for single cell sequencing (in contrast to PanINs). Therefore, 5 freshly obtained IPMNs will be used for the single cell RNA sequencing studies performed at both the Broad Institute and MDACC, and the matched FFPE and/or frozen sections from these lesions (obtained from the adjacent PML) will be sent to Broad Institute as a pilot to assess ""single nuclei"" RNA sequencing.</p><p><b><i>4. PINs from <u>prostate</u> tissue: </i></b><br></p><p>For prostate cancer PML, there will be 40 samples of Prostatic Intraepithelial Neoplasia (PIN) collected between the Stanford and JHU sites (20 cases per site). At the Stanford site, 20 prostate specimens detected by PSA screening who have/will undergo surgery (radical prostatectomy) for clinically localized disease will make up the final cohort. The age range of the participants would be 40-75, and we anticipate that 18 will be Caucasian, 1 Asian and 1 Latino or African American based on the practice demographics practice at Stanford. Clinical and MRI data will also be collected for these samples. We will collect low grade (e.g. Gleason score of 6/Grade group 1; n=10) and high grade (Gleason score 4+3=7 or higher/Grade group 3 or higher; n=10) PINs from FFPE samples that have prostate carcinoma. In addition to obtaining LCM archival samples of low and high grade PIN, we will also obtain normal prostatic epithelial from the peripheral, central and transition zones as well as multiple samples of prostate carcinoma in order to obtain the spectrum of Gleason grades in the carcinoma as needed. LCM samples will be used for bulk DNA and RNA sequencing. In addition, single cells will be dissected from FFPE samples to prepare single cell RNA seq libraries using techniques developed at Stanford, and FFPE tissue will be sent to the Broad for single nuclei sequencing. When available, flash frozen and fresh samples from these prostates will be archived and prepared for single nuclei and cell sequencing, respectively, at the Broad Institute and at Stanford (single cell only). JHU will also capture 10 cases (5 grade group 1 and 5 grade group 2) of high grade PIN, normal and invasive adenocarcinoma using frozen sections from fresh frozen tissues. When possible these will be from the same patients as the FFPE samples. </p><p>Since frozen sections can be quite challenging to morphologically determine high grade PIN from normal epithelium, for these samples we will perform a number of additional tissue-based characterizations. These will include a multicolor combined basal cells (p63 and CK903) and PIN/carcinoma markers (AMACR) referred to in the cocktail as ""PIN4"", c-MYC (referred to as MYC) protein5, by IHC and mRNA by in situ hybridization (AM De Marzo, Q Zheng unpublished observations), telomere length by in situ hybridization6 and the 5'ETS/45S rRNA7. For these slides, the whole slides will be scanned with a Hammamatsu Nanozoomer with a 40x objective and regions of interest will be annotated as a guide for LCM.<br></p><p><u><i>II. Laser-capture microdissection (LCM):</i></u> FFPE tissue blocks will be sectioned at 7&#956;m thickness and serial sections will be stained with H&amp;E. LCM will be performed utilizing standard LCM systems, such as Leica LMD7000 and ArcturusXT at each site. Regions of premalignancy will be dissected and RNA/DNA will be extracted from microdissected cells using the Qiagen All Prep DNA/RNA FFPE Kit. </p><p><b>Aim 2: Perform <u>bulk RNA and DNA seq</u> on premalignant FFPE samples and compare the genomic/transcriptomic alterations within and across organ sites. <br></b></p><p><b>Rationale:</b> There have been limited studies characterizing the genomic and transcriptomic landscape of premalignant lesions associated with breast, pancreatic, lung or prostate cancers. Characterizing the molecular determinants of premalignant disease that are unique and shared across multiple organs will enable new candidate biomarkers for early detection and novel therapeutic strategies for early intervention. </p><p><b>Methods</b></p><p>Bulk RNA-seq of LCM FFPE tissue: All participating sites will perform bulk RNA-seq in accordance with SOPs developed at BU. In brief, total RNA will be isolated from LCM'd lesion and associated microenvironment tissue using the Qiagen All Prep DNA/RNA FFPE Kit and quality will be assessed with the Agilent Bioanalyzer. Libraries will be generated with the Illumina TruSeq Access kit (for FFPE samples). They will be sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq2500 with 75base-pair paired-end reads. Quality of FASTQ files will be assessed with FastQC. Reads will be aligned to the human genome with STAR and gene-level and isoform-level expression will be quantified with RSEM. Splice junction saturation, transcript integrity, and biotype distributions will be calculated for each sample with RSeQC. DESeq2 and EdgeR will be used to identify associations between gene expression profiles and clinical variables while controlling for confounding covariates. </p><p>BU will serve as an RNA-seq Core to assess reproducibility of FFPE RNA-seq methods across sites. We will perform RNA-seq according to the SOP listed above on a subset of samples for each organ type (total n ~ 20). <br></p><p><i><u>Bulk seq of DNA from FFPE tissue:</u></i> All participating sites will perform targeted or whole exome-seq (WES) in accordance with SOPs. In brief, DNA from laser captured material will be isolated using the Qiagen All Prep DNA/RNA FFPE Kit and undergo stringent quality control to ensure high quality input material for genomic profiling. Purified DNA (ideally 100-200 ng) will be used for library preparation and amplification, followed by next generation sequencing using standard protocols distributed by CDMG. Exome-seq methods are considered standardized, thus we will not need a DNA-seq Core to assess reproducibility across sites. We anticipate local centers will use Illumina paired end reads, following the following general approach. 1) DNA library preparation: Paired-end libraries will be prepared following the manufacturer's protocols (Illumina and Agilent), fragmented to 150-200 bp 2) Capture of targeted exome: Whole exome capture will be carried out using the protocol for Agilent's SureSelect Human All Exon kit. Purified capture products will be amplified using the SureSelect GA PCR primers (Agilent) for 12 cycles. 3) Sequencing will be carried out for the captured libraries using at least 100 bp paired-end reads. To achieve high level sensitivity and accuracy for detecting all the mutations in the whole exome, each sample will be sequenced at 200X mean depth. 4) Read mapping and alignment and variant analysis: Sequence short reads will be aligned to a reference genome (NCBI human genome assembly build 38) using BWA-MEM. Local realignment of aligned reads will be performed using Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK).</p><p><i style=""""><u>Data QC:</u> </i>To ensure scientific rigor and consistency among sites in RNA and DNA processing we will include a preliminary analysis of steps in processing and analysis. Protocols for extraction of high quality RNA and DNA from formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissues, which will be used extensively in these studies continue to improve and may have variable implementation among the sites participating in this study. To evaluate consistency of preliminary steps in processing and downstream analyses, we will initially distribute slides from one large FFPE fixed cancer of origin from prostate, breast, lung and pancreatic cancer. Analysis of these samples will allow us to review the DNA and RNA characteristics (yield, purity and strand length) among sites. Downstream analysis of these same samples will also allow us to compare among sites the consistency of variant calls among centers. We will be able to identify if there are some times of calls (such as small insertion deletions) that are more variable among centers versus other types of calls (such as relative gene expression or single base pair substitutions) that we expect to be less variable and to characterize the reliability of findings across sites. We are also including a 5% blind duplicate analysis of RNA sequencing. Samples will be analysed by the participating genomics cores without knowledge of the phenotype. RNA seq and CNA analyses are normalized for batch effects. We will also compare the observed sex to the self-reported sex as based on RNA profiles and exome sequencing of X chromosome genes as another check for processing accuracy and sample management. <br></p><p><b>D.

Subjects were selected that had biopsies collected in repeat locations via serial bronchoscopies. mRNA sequencing was performed on a discovery cohort (DC) of samples comprising endobronchial biopsies and brushes collected between 2010 and 2012 (n=30 subjects, n=197 biopsies, and n=91 brushings). mRNA sequencing was subsequently performed on a validation cohort (VC) of samples comprising endobronchial biopsies and brushes collected between 2010 and 2015 (n=20 subjects, n=111 biopsies, and n=49 brushings). Data analysis identified four distinct molecular subtypes (Proliferative, Inflammatory, Secretory, and Normal) in the bronchial biopsies that correspond to a spectrum of biological and morphological alterations. The Proliferative subtype was enriched with dysplastic PMLs from current smokers that exhibit up-regulation of metabolic and cell cycle pathways and down-regulation of cilium-associated processes. Molecular subtype classification in the validation cohort biopsies replicated these significant clinical and biological associations. Airway brushes from normal fluorescing areas of the large airway classified as the Proliferative subtype specifically predict the presence of biopsies of this same subtype. Within the Proliferative subtype, genes associated with interferon signaling and antigen processing and presentation were observed to be down-regulated among dysplastic biopsies that persist or progress in the future. Innate and adaptive immune cells were computationally predicted to be depleted in these biopsies and this was confirmed via immunofluorescence staining of adjacent biopsies. These findings provide a proof of concept that molecular biomarkers of endobronchial biopsies can enhance histopathological grading and that immunoprevention strategies are an important future direction in intercepting the progression of PMLs to lung cancer.</p><p>FASTQ files from the RNA sequencing of these biopsies and brushings will be available via dbGaP.<br></p><p> </p><p> </p>",Avrum E.

Cell-type specific DNA methylation patterns can be used to decode the cellular origins of cell-free DNA fragments, allowing for minimally-invasive monitoring of tissue damage. To evaluate whether changes in cell-free DNA methylation can indicate damages to tissues in patients treated with radiation, we collected serum samples from 15 breast cancer patients at three timepoints during their standard-of-care radiation therapy after surgery. A baseline sample was taken for each patient before onset of radiation therapy and a second End-Of-Treatment (EOT) sample was taken 30 minutes after the last treatment fraction. Finally, a recovery sample was taken one month after completion of radiation therapy. From serum samples, cell-free DNA was isolated and bisulfite capture-sequencing DNA methylation data were generated. Bisulfite capture-sequencing DNA methylation data were also generated from buffy coat and tissue-specific endothelial gDNA samples as well as from serum/plasma samples of healthy controls. The analysis of serum samples from breast cancer patients undergoing radiation treatment revealed distinct tissue-specific epithelial and endothelial responses to radiation across multiple organs. In conclusion, as a proof of concept we show that cell-type specific methylation signatures can be applied to detect cellular injury from radiation treatment using minimally invasive cell-free DNA in blood samples. </p>",Anton Wellstein,37318863,RO1CA231291;P30CA51008;T32CA009686;F30CA250307,Epigenetics;Longitudinal,,,Radiotherapy,29.0,59.0,GRU-IRB-COL,Bisulfite-Seq,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs003290,nan,nan,ecf82f6d-0ca6-492a-9f7d-1eea2e94b0fb,dbGaP

This is the first study to our knowledge to analyze mega-base scale structural variants (SVs) in EMC. Our data validates copy number variants (CNVs) found in previous studies. While the primary tumor and lung metastasis had similar somatic variations and CNVs, the pelvic metastasis had more SVs with especially increased mutational burden of SVs in chromosome 2.

This can occur through a variety of mechanisms, including changes in gene dosage and the generation of fusion genes. In recent years, it is becoming increasingly clear that these events also can alter how genomes are organized in 3D space in the nucleus and contribute to changes in enhancer-promoter regulation. However, it remains poorly understand how often 3D genome structural changes occur in cancers, what genes are affected by these events, and in which tumor types. This study is part of ongoing work to better characterize 3D genome structural changes across a variety of tumor types to better understand where and when 3D genome structure changes as the result of structural variation in cancer genomes and to characterize the genes and tumor types affected.</p>",Jesse R.

Current chemotherapy regimens for BL are effective in approximately 40-90% of patients, depending on age, stage of the disease, treatment regimen, and site of the treatment facility. Hence, new treatments are needed to improve the efficacy of current regimens and to potentially substitute less toxic agents for the high intensity chemotherapeutic drugs currently given.</p> <p>The goal of the CGCI BLGSP study was to explore potential genetic changes in patients with BL that could lead to better prevention, detection and treatment of the cancer. OCG provided the administrative and analytical infrastructure needed to carry out this project based on lessons learned in managing other major cancer genomics projects. The BLGSP study included adult and pediatric patients with sporadic BL, as well as those with endemic and HIV-positive sporadic BL.</p> <p>The first major objective of the BLGSP was to accrue tumor and patient-matched control tissues obtained by precise protocols from a relatively large number of clinically well-annotated cases of BL. The second objective was to characterize the alterations of the tumors' genomes (with matched normal as control) and transcriptomes by sequencing the DNA and RNA of each case.

Multilayer proteogenomic architecture revealed distinct endogenous and environmental carcinogen-associated mutagenesis, linking APOBEC (apolipoprotein-B mRNA editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like) cytidine deaminase and DBAC (dibenz[a,j] acridine) signatures to significantly elevated hormone biosynthesis and chemical carcinogenesis in younger patients, and identifying a novel subset of high mutation burden and immune escape potentially beneficial from combined epigenetic therapy and immunotherapy. A proteomics-informed classification resolves luminal heterogeneity, defines high-risk recurrent luminal disease and nominates biomarkers and actionable druggable pathways.

phs000450,Whole Exome Sequencing of Primary Mediastinal B-cell Lymphoma,Primary Mediastinal B-cell Lymphoma,2023-06-08,,Not Provided,"<p>Primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphomas (PMBLs) are aggressive tumors that typically present as large mediastinal masses in young women. PMBLs share clinical, transcriptional, and molecular features with classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL), including constitutive activation of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB), JAK/STAT signaling, and programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)-mediated immune evasion. The demonstrated efficacy of PD-1 blockade in relapsed/refractory PMBLs led to recent approval by the US Food and Drug Administration and underscored the importance of characterizing targetable genetic vulnerabilities in this disease. Here, we report a comprehensive analysis of recurrent genetic alterations -somatic mutations, somatic copy number alterations, and structural variants-in a cohort of 37 newly diagnosed PMBLs. We identified a median of 9 genetic drivers per PMBL, including known and newly identified components of the JAK/STAT and NF-kappaB signaling pathways and frequent B2M alterations that limit major histocompatibility complex class I expression, as in cHL. PMBL also exhibited frequent, newly identified driver mutations in ZNF217 and an additional epigenetic modifier, EZH2. The majority of these alterations were clonal, which supports their role as early drivers. In PMBL, we identified several previously uncharacterized molecular features that may increase sensitivity to PD-1 blockade, including high tumor mutational burden, microsatellite instability, and an apolipoprotein B mRNA editing catalytic polypeptide-like (APOBEC) mutational signature. The shared genetic features between PMBL and cHL provide a framework for analyzing the mechanism of action of PD-1 blockade in these related lymphoid malignancies.</p>",Margaret A Shipp;Gad Getz,31697821,,Case Set;Tumor,,,,361.0,517.0,DS-CA-MDS;HMB;DS-BLD-MDS;GRU-NPU-MDS,Seq_DNA_SNP;WXS,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000450,nan,nan,b43c836c-d552-45d4-b08d-a48d8448dd0d,dbGaP

The cell composition of the HCC tumor immune microenvironment (TiME) has a major impact on cancer biology as the TiME can have divergent capacities on tumor initiation, progress, and response to therapy. Recent development of multi-omics and single-cell technologies help us to comprehensively quantify the cellular heterogeneity and spatial organization of the TiME and to further our understanding of antitumor immunity. We investigated the cellular composition of liver cancer patient samples (n=8) using single-cell RNA-seq. For this purpose, mononuclear cells were isolated from human liver cancer samples. Three locations within the tumor-bearing liver were used: adjacent liver, rim and tumor core. Then, cells were FACS sorted (either CD45+ cells or MAIT cells) and subjected to 10X Chromium-based scRNA-seq. We investigated immune cell changes and the cellular heterogeneity of the HCC TiME with a focus on MAIT cells. Annotated H5 files are provided.

First-line chemotherapy for metastatic CRC (mCRC) entails a combination of irinotecan with 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin (FOLFIRI). Irinotecan is a prodrug that is converted within the cell to its active metabolite SN38, a potent TOP1 inhibitor. TOP1 relieves DNA torsional strain arising from DNA metabolism by cleaving one strand of the DNA duplex and forming an enzyme-DNA covalent intermediate that can be trapped by inhibitors. The resulting TOP1 DNA-protein crosslinks (TOP1-DPCs) interfere with replication and transcription and induce cell death if left unrepaired. I have established the role of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in TOP1-DPC repair, but it remains unknown how ubiquitylation is activated. One possibility is that collision between advancing replication forks and the DPCs triggers a specific ubiquitin ligase to target DPCs for degradation. The DDB1-CUL4 (Cullin 4)-RBX1 (CRL4) ubiquitin ligase complex performs a salient role in both replication and DNA repair upon its activation by auto-NEDD8 modification (neddylation), but it is unknown whether it plays a role for TOP1-DPC repair. </p><p>We plan to define the role of neddylation for TOP1-DPC repair during replication and examine irinotecan plus pevonedistat (PEV), a NEDD8-activating enzyme inhibitor in multiple clinical trials, in CRC patient-derived preclinical models including 3D organoids. The three in-house organoids, from which samples have been submitted to dbGaP, were sequenced as a means of verifying their identity as colon cancer organoids, to allow us to investigate the combination of TOP1 inhibitors and PEV and the molecular mechanisms underlying this drug combination in these organoids.</p><p> </p>","Yves  Pommier, MD, PhD",,Z01 BC 006150,Cohort,,ANXA1;FABP6;ACE2;FXYD5;LY6E;SERPINE2;SCD;BMP4;CEACAM6;TESC;TGFBI,,3.0,3.0,GRU,RNA-Seq,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs003257,nan,nan,fcf94861-595e-4245-8f79-8f1bbfc8d70e,dbGaP

However, published models explaining how these genomic rearrangements occur disagree about if these rearrangements occur early in tumor progression and then are stable afterwards, or if there is ongoing genomic instability. Previous studies have employed bulk sequencing technologies to characterize genomic alterations. A limitation of this approach is that it averages all changes within the bulk sample, essentially masking intra-sample heterogeneity and making evaluation of ongoing genomic instability difficult. To overcome this limitation and compliment previous work, we utilized single-cell whole genome sequencing to quantify somatic copy number alterations (SCNA). By interrogating individual cells within a sample, we were able to examine intra-sample heterogeneity. We found that the SCNA patterns between cells within a single sample were remarkably consistent, which supports the concept that the genomes of osteosarcoma tumors are relatively stable after early genome fragmentation events. <br></p>","Ryan D.

However, the large diversity of HLA alleles and restricted availability of clinical samples have limited the study of the specificity and the evolution over time of the neoantigen-specific T cell responses induced after treatment with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) immunotherapy. </p><p><b>Methods</b>: We applied a newly developed neoepitope-specific T cell isolation technology to perform a longitudinal landscape analysis of the neoepitope-specific T cells in peripheral blood and tumor from 11 patients with metastatic melanoma; 7 with response and 4 with no response to ICB. Briefly, first using computational prediction, the putative neoantigens in each patient were ranked based on affinity for the patient's HLA and expression levels. Then hundreds of barcoded capture reagents consisting of the patient HLA class I subtypes loaded with the corresponding predicted neoantigen were made and used to isolate neoepitope-specific T cells. Once isolated, the TCRs and the barcodes were sequenced. Finally, the tumor reactivity of the isolated neoepitope-specific TCRs (neoTCRs) was assessed upon co-culture of autologous melanoma cell lines from each patient with primary human T cells expressing the neoTCRs generated using a CRISPR-based non-viral gene editing to replace the endogenous TCRs. </p><p><b>Results</b>: The tumor mutation burden ranged between 3507 and 177 for patients with response to therapy and 977 to 31 for patients without response to therapy. We screened a median of 172 predicted neoantigen-HLA per patient across their 6 HLA molecules and isolated neoTCRs in all 11 patients. The number of mutations targeted ranged between 13 and 1. We assessed the neoTCR-tumor reactivity in samples from 3 patients with response and 3 patients without response. 39 of the 62 neoTCRs demonstrated specific recognition and cytotoxicity to patient-matched melanoma cell lines. Multiple T cell clonotypes recognized a limited number of mutations in 7 patients with response (median of 41 different neoTCR clonotypes per patient), and the T cell specificities were recurrently detected in the blood and the tumor over time. Samples from 4 patients without response to therapy also demonstrated neoepitope-specific T cell responses in blood and tumor to a similarly restricted number of mutations, but lacked TCR polyclonality (median 6.5 neoTCR clonotypes per patient) and were not recurrently detected in sequential samples. </p><p><b>Conclusion</b>: Effective ICB therapy is associated with polyclonal neoepitope-specific T-cell responses in the tumor and blood that recognize a limited number of immunodominant mutations and are recurrently detected over time. </p>","Antoni Ribas, MD, PhD;Cristina Puig-Saus, PhD",36890230,R35 CA197633;P01 CA244118,Case Set,,,Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors,11.0,33.0,HMB-PUB,RNA-Seq;WXS,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs003153,nan,nan,afc102ad-1c54-43da-8da6-ba1ffe03748e,dbGaP

Mean tumor mutational burden (TMB) was higher in the SqD versus the NOS-UC regions. Consistent with the higher TMB, the SqD regions also had a higher neoantigen burden than the patient-matched NOS-UC regions. The SqD regions also exhibited higher karyotypic complexity with a higher median ploidy relative to the paired NOS-UC regions. Phylogenetic analysis of the WES data confirmed that the morphologically distinct regions of all 21 tumors arose from a shared precursor with a median of 68 (range 16 &#8211; 852) non-synonymous mutations shared between the NOS-UC and SqD regions, and the overall data were indicative of early branched evolution. As whole exome sequencing did not identify a shared mutational alteration or genomic signature unique to the SqD or NOS-UC components, we therefore performed expression profiling of separable SqD and NOS-UC regions of 12 bladder tumors from the WES cohort with RNA quality sufficient for whole transcriptome RNA-sequencing (RNAseq, total of 24 regions). Based on centroid clustering analysis of expression data, all 12 regions of SqD were basal-squamous subtype based on the TCGA molecular classification schema. Notably, 8 of the NOS-UC regions were also basal-squamous subtype, with only four pairs exhibiting discordant transcriptional subtypes (three NOS-UC regions were luminal-infiltrated, one luminal-papillary). To better quantify differences in the transcriptional profiles of the paired NOS-UC and SqD regions, we used single sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) to assess for enrichment of luminal or basal-squamous gene expression. ssGSEA analysis revealed that the SqD regions expressed higher levels of basal-squamous genes based on the BASE47 gene set and UPK/KRT gene sets; whereas the matched NOS-UC regions expressed higher levels of luminal genes.

Their exceptional influence on disease outcome is well documented by GWAS and candidate gene studies. The impact of HLA allelic variation on human disease through allele-specific presentation of antigenic peptides to T cells has been the main focus to determine HLA effects on disease susceptibility/pathogenesis. However, HLA expression levels have also been implicated in disease, adding another dimension to the extreme diversity of HLA that impacts variability in immune responses across individuals. HLA expression levels routinely rely on quantitative PCR (qPCR). An alternative is adoption of high throughput technologies such as RNA-Seq. This provides the opportunity to quantify HLA expression in large datasets, but also allows comparison between RNA-Seq and qPCR. In this study, we analyze expression data for HLA Class I genes for a matched set of individuals (N = 96) by RNA-Seq, qPCR and cell surface expression. Samples were obtained from the Research Donor Program (NCI-Frederick). We observed a moderate correlation between RNA-Seq and qPCR.

The homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) score of all tumors was low.</p><p>CT-pNENs have a unique molecular signature compared to other pNEN subtypes, specifically involving the FGFR4, DPYD, MUC4, MUC16 and the KRT family genes. However, these WES data from only five cases must be interpreted with caution because causal interpretation of the mutational landscape in CT-pNENs is difficult. Further research is needed to explain differences in pathogenesis compared with other pNENs. In particular, multi-omics data such as RNASeq, methylation, and whole genome sequencing could be informative.</p>",Detlef Klaus Bartsch,,,Clinical Cohort;Cohort;Copy Number Variation (CNV);Exome Sequencing;GWAS;Prospective;Sequencing;Tumor;Tumor vs. Matched-Normal,,,,5.0,10.0,GRU,WGS,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs003060,nan,nan,cd099973-1a67-4282-9bec-e5e18b8a54d7,dbGaP

Small animal and, in particular, mouse model systems are attractive to researchers for numerous reasons, including their ease of use and well-described platforms. </p><p>The ability to grow human tumors in immune-deficient mice (so-called patient-derived xenografts, or PDXs) allows researchers to work directly with human cancer tissue in a controlled setting. However, PDX models are limited by their lack of an intact immune system. Immunotherapy has revolutionized clinical oncology, but lacks pre-clinical models of the human immune system and human cancer to investigate new modalities and limitations/toxicities of treatment regimens. The broad objective of this study is to validate an in vivo model to evaluate human tumors in the context of a complete and intact human immune system in a completely personalized and autologous fashion to study cancer immunotherapy. Herein, we will: (1) validate the ability of our humanized system to serve as a model for cancer immunotherapy treatment response and toxicity in patients with melanoma, including immunotherapy checkpoint blockade and vaccine strategies, and (2) extend our current work in melanoma by validating the ability to establish humanized mice and evaluate tumor growth and leukocyte development in autologous human pancreatic and colorectal tumors established in humanized mice. In each of these areas, we will leverage our multi-institutional team's individual expertise along with our institutional infrastructure to maximize the success of the experimental aims. The results from this project will be widely available to the general research community for future, hypothesis-driven research. Taken together, our study will meet multiple goals and address several unmet needs in cancer immunotherapy, thus significantly enhancing the applicability of a fully autologous and immunocompetent precision model system for use in translational oncology research. </p>",Ryan C.

Using multiplexed FISH analysis of 3-4 tumor cores from 17 glioblastoma formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumors, we identified two classes of tumors based on single cell co-occurrence of EGFR and CDK4 amplification. Tumors with a low odds ratio for finding EGFR and CDK4 amplified in the same cell (ORlow tumors) had higher EGFR copy number and higher diversity of copy number in cells harboring EGFR amplification. This suggested that in ORlow tumors EGFR is likely present on extrachromosomal DNA. To test this hypothesis, we performed whole genome sequencing on DNA extracted from FFPE slides from 3 ORlow samples and 3 ORhigh samples and used AmpliconArchitect to investigate the structure of the EGFR amplicon. We found multiple breakpoints and high complexity structure in the 3 tested ORlow samples, but not in the ORhigh samples, supporting the possibility of an extrachromosomal nature of EGFR amplification in the first group.</p>",Michalina Janiszewska,,,Tumor;Whole Genome Sequencing,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.09.20.461080v1,EGFR;CDK4,DNA Copy Number Variations;Genomic Structural Variation,6.0,6.0,GRU,WGS,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs003100,nan,nan,ec85de6a-77d7-4186-b1e5-9e3b04f36c9c,dbGaP

Biological replicates were performed for 4 of the 7 subjects; 2 of these subjects had specimens demonstrating an additive response to the combination of glucocorticoids and idelalisib in viability testing in vitro, and 2 subjects' specimens demonstrated a synergistic response. All 7 subjects were analyzed together and the 4 specimens with biological replicates were also evaluated in an additional analysis. An average of 40 million reads per specimen and treatment condition were obtained. We compared gene expression in each treatment condition to vehicle-treated cells and expression in glucocorticoid or idelalisib only treated cells to combination treated cells.

In particular, multiple targeted therapy regimens have been approved for patients with a BRAFV600E/K mutation, which are present in ~50% of cutaneous melanomas. These treatments achieve clinical responses in ~80% of patients with a BRAFV600E/K mutation, thus providing proof-of-concept of the therapeutic potential for personalized therapeutic strategies. However, most of the patients will progress within 2 years of starting those therapies. Further, currently there are no targeted therapies that have been shown to be effective in patients with a wild-type <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/673"" target=""_blank"">BRAF</a>. Thus, there are unmet clinical needs to develop treatments that prevent or overcome resistance to existing therapies for patients with a BRAFV600E/K mutation, and that are effective in patients without a BRAF mutation. In order to facilitate the development of new therapeutic strategies, over the last 5 years we have led a major effort to develop a broad collection of PDX models to reflect the clinical, histological, and genetic heterogeneity of this disease. Our collection of PDX models represents one of the largest collections for any human malignancy, and our initial testing demonstrates that the collection accurately recapitulates the oncogenic drivers and molecular heterogeneity that is observed in patients. This collection also includes a subset of PDX established from patients with acquired resistance to targeted therapies that have been maintained on those agents in vivo to sustain their resistant phenotype. Together these efforts have generated a robust resource to develop, refine, and prioritize new personalized combinatorial therapies for patients. Thus, we propose to establish a multi-disciplinary and multi-institutional PDTC Program focused on the use and continued expansion of our robust melanoma PDX collection to identify new therapeutic approaches that fill important clinical gaps in this disease.<br></p>",Meenhard Herlyn,,,Case Set;Exome Sequencing;RNA Sequencing,,,Skin Neoplasms,46.0,185.0,GRU-COL,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs002432,nan,nan,a77d837b-f9f1-47cd-acd4-a6c65333c732,dbGaP

Namely, ITH high tumors are enriched for mutations in SETD2, PBRM1, CDKN2A/B somatic copy number loss and HLA loss of heterozygosity, and they demonstrate the characteristics of immune escape. ITH high tumors demonstrate reduced peripheral blood TCR diversity which is associated with neoantigen depletion.

Fanconi anemia is a rare hereditary disease caused by defects in DNA interstrand crosslink repair. The primary patient phenotypes are bone marrow failure and cancer predisposition.

Another goal was to compare the genomic changes identified in tumors from Fanconi anemia patients with sporadic head and neck cancers. </p><p>This study demonstrated that the tumors from Fanconi anemia individuals are generally not driven by HPV. Instead, they acquire mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor. The main characteristic of the tumors is the presence of a high number of structural variants in the form of small deletions, unbalanced translocations, and fold-back inversions, which often form complex rearrangements. These rearrangements result in amplifications and deletions of a multitude of oncogenes and tumor suppressors, respectively. The study also shows that lack of the Fanconi anemia DNA repair pathway leads to an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in a mouse model and in human samples that may influence the behavior of tumors in Fanconi anemia. Finally, comparing genomic changes in Fanconi anemia and sporadic tumors of the head and neck, we propose that the structural variants present in sporadic cancer result in a functional deficiency of the Fanconi anemia DNA repair pathway. </p>","Agata Smogorzewska, MD, PhD",,"Pershing Square Sohn Prize for Young Investigators in Cancer Research;Fanconi Anemia Research Fund award;R01 HL120922;R01 CA204127;National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (UL1 TR001866);Rubicon fellowship  (019.153LW.038);KWF Kankerbestrijding Young Investigator Grant (12797/2019-2, Bas Mulder Award);Howard Hughes Faculty Scholar Award",Copy Number Variation (CNV);Exome Sequencing;Single Cell Analysis;Transcriptome Sequencing;Tumor vs. Matched-Normal;Whole Genome Sequencing,,FANCA;FANCC;FANCG;FANCD2;FANCM;FANCJ;FANCP;PIK3CA;MYC;EGFR;BRCA1;BRCA2;p53,Squamous Cell Carcinoma of Head and Neck;Genomic Instability;DNA Damage;DNA Copy Number Variations,50.0,137.0,NRUP;GRU,WXS;WGS;Synthetic-Long-Read;Array_DNA_Methylation;OTHER;RNA-Seq,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs002652,nan,nan,3e29ff66-a49c-4334-9b35-f755f25dc611,dbGaP

In contrast, CaP is among the most heritable of common cancers, and over 290 susceptibility loci have been identified. However, many of these loci have not been replicated in AA, in part because of limited African descent sample sizes, incomplete capture of African alleles, and a limited understanding of African genomic architecture.

Owing to TP53 mutation in the majority of cases, DNA repair deficiency through loss of BRCA1 and BRCA2, and by expression features patterning a basal cell of origin, TNBC represents a molecularly and clinically distinct group of breast cancer patients. Unfortunately, targetable molecular features of TNBC remain elusive and TNBC patients suffer the poorest outcomes amongst clinical subgroups. Within TNBC patients, responses to treatment vary and although gene expression patterns within TNBC have been identified, little progress has been made in developing biomarkers; effective stratification as a route to directing patients to more targeted therapy is lacking.

Cases with a first diagnosis of invasive colorectal cancer (International Classification of Diseases 10 codes C18-C20) who were at least 30 years of age (no upper age limit), German speaking, a resident in the study region, and mentally and physically able to participate in a one-hour interview, were recruited by their treating physicians either in the hospital a few days after surgery, or by mail after discharge from the hospital. Cases were confirmed based on histologic reports and hospital discharge letters following diagnosis of colorectal cancer. All hospitals treating colorectal cancer patients in the study region participated. Based on estimates from population-based cancer registries, more than 50% of all potentially eligible patients with incident colorectal cancer in the study region were included. Community-based controls were randomly selected from population registries, employing frequency matching with respect to age (5-year groups), sex, and county of residence. Controls with a history of colorectal cancer were excluded. Controls were contacted by mail and follow-up calls. The participation rate was 51%. During an in-person interview, data were collected on demographics, medical history, family history of CRC, and various life-style factors, as were blood and mouthwash samples. Routine formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor samples from the patients enrolled were requested from the pathology institutes and used for tumor tissue analyses.

Participants provided information on health related exposures, including current and past smoking history, age, weight, height, diet, physical activity, aspirin use, and family history of colorectal cancer. Colorectal cancer and other outcomes were reported by participants or next-of-kin and were followed up through review of the medical and pathology record by physicians. Overall, more than 97% of self-reported colorectal cancers were confirmed by medical record review. Information was abstracted on histology and primary location. Incident cases were defined as those occurring after the subject provided the blood sample. Prevalent cases were defined as those occurring after enrollment in the study but before the subject provided the blood sample. Follow-up evaluation has been excellent, with 94% of the men responding to date. Colorectal cancer cases were ascertained through January 1, 2008. In 1993-1995, 18,825 men in the HPFS mailed blood samples by overnight courier, which were aliquoted into buffy coat and stored in liquid nitrogen.

The original WHI study included 161,808 postmenopausal women enrolled between 1993 and 1998. The Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, WA serves as the WHI Clinical Coordinating Center for data collection, management, and analysis of the WHI. The WHI has two major parts: a partial factorial randomized Clinical Trial (CT) and an Observational Study (OS); both were conducted at 40 Clinical Centers nationwide. The CT enrolled 68,132 postmenopausal women between the ages of 50-79 into trials testing three prevention strategies. If eligible, women could choose to enroll in one, two, or all three of the trial components. The components are: <b>Hormone Therapy Trials (HT): </b>This double-blind component examined the effects of combined hormones or estrogen alone on the prevention of coronary heart disease and osteoporotic fractures, and associated risk for breast cancer. Women participating in this component with an intact uterus were randomized to estrogen plus progestin (conjugated equine estrogens [CEE], 0.625 mg/d plus medroxyprogesterone acetate [MPA] 2.5 mg/d) or a matching placebo. Women with prior hysterectomy were randomized to CEE or placebo. Both trials were stopped early, in July 2002 and March 2004, respectively, based on adverse effects. All HT participants continued to be followed without intervention until close-out. <b>Dietary Modification Trial (DM):</b> The Dietary Modification component evaluated the effect of a low-fat and high fruit, vegetable and grain diet on the prevention of breast and colorectal cancers and coronary heart disease. Study participants were randomized to either their usual eating pattern or a low-fat dietary pattern. <b>Calcium/Vitamin D Trial (CaD): </b>This double-blind component began 1 to 2 years after a woman joined one or both of the other clinical trial components. It evaluated the effect of calcium and vitamin D supplementation on the prevention of osteoporotic fractures and colorectal cancer. Women in this component were randomized to calcium (1000 mg/d) and vitamin D (400 IU/d) supplements or a matching placebo. The <b>Observational Study (OS)</b> examines the relationship between lifestyle, environmental, medical and molecular risk factors and specific measures of health or disease outcomes. This component involves tracking the medical history and health habits of 93,676 women not participating in the CT. Recruitment for the observational study was completed in 1998 and participants were followed annually for 8 to 12 years. All centrally confirmed White cases of invasive colorectal cancer, or death from colorectal cancer were selected as potential cases from the March, 2011 database. Case priory lists are: 1) have positive family history of colorectal cancer; 2) randomly select cases until we get a total of n=800 cases. Control participants were required to be White, free of invasive colorectal cancer and non-invasive (stage 0 in situ) colorectal cancer. Centrally denied cases of colorectal cancer were not allowed into the control pool. Case and control participants were subject to the following exclusion criteria: (1) had prior history of colorectal cancer at baseline; (2) had no available DNA (DNA searching as Nov 15, 2012); (3) cannot be deposited to dbGaP; (4) lost to follow-up after enrollment; (5) selected for WHI study M26 Phase II. Controls were matched to cases in a case/control ratio of 2:1. In order to get 2 cases with 1 control, cases were grouped by enrollment year (a total of 5 groups). For each year group, around 50% cases were selected to match controls. In total, 401 cases were selected to match controls. Matching was done on enrollment year, which was matched exactly.

Using ichorCNA, a software tool that quantifies tumor content in ultra-low pass whole genome sequencing (~0.1x) of cfDNA without prior genomic characterization of the tumor, we show genome-wide concordance between cfDNA and tumor biopsies and detectability of high tumor fractions (&gt;0.1) in the cfDNA of many patients with metastatic cancer. We then established that whole-exome sequencing of cfDNA can enable comprehensive profiling of tumors from blood, with high tumor-content cfDNA samples demonstrating concordance of clonal somatic mutations, copy number alterations, mutational signatures, and neoantigens with matched tumor biopsies.

The CCFRC was formed as a resource to support studies on the etiology, prevention, and clinical management of colorectal cancer. Recruitment protocols fall broadly into two main categories: population-based and clinic-based ascertainment. Between 1998 and 2013, the CCFR recruited and interviewed probands who were either recently diagnosed with colorectal cancer that was reported to state or regional population cancer registries in the United States (Washington, California, Arizona, Minnesota, Colorado, New Hampshire, North Carolina, and Hawaii), Australia (Victoria), and Canada (Ontario) or were from multiple-case families referred to family-cancer clinics in the United States (Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, and Cleveland Clinic in Cleveland, Ohio), Australia (Melbourne, Adelaide, Perth, Brisbane, and Sydney), New Zealand (Auckland), and Canada. Cases with known familial adenomatous polyposis were excluded. Once recruited, probands were asked for permission to contact their relatives for recruitment. Collectively, we have enrolled 42,49874 participants in 15,048 families who participated in standardized protocols used to collect information regarding family cancer history and colorectal cancer risk factors and biospecimens. All participants of population-based case families (excluding control-families) and clinic-based families are asked to provide updates on their personal and family history of cancer as well as their history of surgery, cancer screening, and some risk factors every 4-5 years either by telephone interview or by self-completed questionnaire via mail or online (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17982118/"" target=""_blank"">PMID: 17982118</a>).</p>",Jane A.

Thus, the BCFR comprises a unique cohort of probands and family members at familial/genetic risk of breast cancer that will continue to facilitate a wide range of research studies, such as gene discovery, examination of cancer-related outcomes and risk factors in high-risk subjects, investigation of novel behavioral interventions, and cancer prevention trials among at-risk family members.

phs002903,The Role of CDX2 in Controlling ABCB1 Expression and Chemosensitivity in    Human Colon Cancer,Colonic Neoplasms,2022-07-26,,"CA - Cancer of colon; COLON CANCER; Cancer of Colon; Cancer of the Colon; Cancer, Colon; Cancer, Colonic","<p>This study reports the results of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) experiments performed on two human colon cancer cell lines (HT-29, DLD-1) that were genetically engineered to achieve either the constitutive expression (in HT-29 cells) or the selective inactivation (in DLD-1 cells) of the transcription factor CDX2, a master regulator of embryonic gut development and a key regulator of multi-lineage differentiation in adult colon epithelial cells. Our previous studies had identified lack of CDX2 expression as a prognostic biomarker of poor prognosis and a predictive biomarker of benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy in Stage-II and Stage-III colon cancer patients (Dalerba et al., NEJM, 374:211-222, 2016; <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26789870/"" target=""_blank"">PMID: 26789870</a>). The molecular basis of these associations, however, remained poorly understood. The present study was designed to identify which genes are under the transcriptional control of CDX2, in order to clarify their role in shaping colon cancer resistance to chemotherapy. Of the two lines included in this study, the first (HT-29) is CDX2-negative at baseline, and was infected with a lentivirus vector encoding for the cDNA of the human CDX2 gene under the control of a constitutive promoter (CMV). The second line (DLD-1) is CDX2-positive at baseline, and was infected with a series of lentivirus vectors encoding for CRISPR/Cas9 constructs designed to selectively inactivate the CDX2 gene. In both cases, infected cells were purified by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), based on the differential expression of a green fluorescent reporter (EGFP) that was also encoded by the lentivirus vectors, and transcribed in tandem with either the CDX2 cDNA (HT-29) or CRISPR/Cas9 gRNAs targeting CDX2 (DLD-1). The experiments were designed to include 3 experimental replicates per condition, and to compare the transcriptional profile of genetically engineered cells with that of autologous controls (i.e., HT-29 cells infected with an ""empty"" version of the same lentivirus vector used to over-express CDX2, DLD-1 cells engineered with a ""non-targeting"" CRISPR/Cas9 gRNA). In the specific case of DLD-1 cells engineered with CRIPSR-Cas9 constructs targeting CDX2, infected cells were sorted based on the differential expression of EGFP and then plated as single-cells, in order to sub-culture three isogenic clones, all of which were genetically sequenced to confirm bi-allelic knock-out of the CDX2 gene, and confirmed to lack CDX2 protein expression by Western blot. The results of our experiments demonstrate that, in human colon epithelial cells, CDX2 controls the expression of the ABCB1 efflux pump, by positively regulating the transcription of the corresponding gene.</p>","Piero Dalerba, MD",26789870,DRR-44-16;Schaefer Scholar Research Program;TL1 TR001875;T32 DK007328;P30 CA013696;UL1 TR001873,Marker Discovery;RNA Sequencing;Tumor,,CDX2;ABCB1,Antineoplastic Agents;Paclitaxel,2.0,12.0,GRU,RNA-Seq,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs002903,nan,nan,a6b9f0cc-d9ac-4c9c-aa2f-0a6c228cbf3d,dbGaP

The data presented in this study encompass blood and bone marrow samples from patients &#8804; 21 years of age with relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) participating in the SJCAR19 phase I/II clinical trial (<a href=""https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03573700"" target=""_blank"">NCT03573700</a>). In brief, patients enrolled in the clinical trial received either 1 x 10^6 (dose level 1) or 3 x 10^6 (dose level 2) per kilogram of body weight following successful generation of autologous CAR T cell products and lymphodepleting chemotherapy. Peripheral blood was drawn from each participant every week until week 4 post-infusion, at week 6 or 8, and month 3 or 6 if feasible. At week 4 post-infusion, blood marrow was also collected from participants. Total T cells (CD3+) were sorted from each post-infusion sample, as well as the pre-infusion CAR T cell products, and processed through 10x Genomics&#39; single-cell gene expression and V(D)J sequencing platform using the standard protocol. We identified a unique and unexpected transcriptional signature in a subset of pre-infusion CAR T cells that shared TCRs with post-infusion cytotoxic effector CAR T cells. Functional validation of cells with even a subset of these pre-effector markers demonstrated their immediate cytotoxic potential and resistance to exhaustion.

We reasoned that low-coverage whole-genome sequencing of blood samples routinely carried out in cancer genomics projects may be repurposed to detect clonal hematopoiesis (CH). Thus, inspired by a previous approach to identify early mutations in the development of the hematopoietic system, we implemented a pipeline to systematically carry out this ""reverse"" somatic mutation calling on the paired blood/tumor samples. Blood somatic mutations were called using a 'reverse' approach, in which the tumor sample taken from each patient was used as control of their germline genome. Blood somatic mutations are thus detected as variants in the blood (with respect to the human reference genome) that are absent in the tumor sample. The variant calling was carried out in our in house cluster on downloaded blood/tumor BAM files. The matched blood and tumoral BAM files -- masked and deduplicated using GATK -- of 8,530 whole-exome patients were obtained as described above. The variant calling was carried out using Strelka2 (employing default parameters) with the blood sample as the tumoral input and the tumor sample as control (reverse calling). All variants with two or more supporting reads matching the caller PASS filter and with VAF&lt;0.5 were kept. Mutations in lowly mappable regions as defined by the DUST algorithm (k=30) and UMAP68 (36-kmers) were excluded. Contiguous variants were merged into double-base substitutions. Variants with greater frequency across the cohorts than the DNMT3A R882H or JAK2 V617F hotspot in a cohort-specific Panel of Normals and in gnomAD v2.1 were removed. This was equivalent to discarding variants present in these datasets with an allele frequency greater than 0.008 in PoN TCGA and 0.0003 in gnomAD v2.1. Additionally, common SNPs as defined by the dbSNP 151 Common UCSC track and dbSNP were excluded. Mutations within segmental duplications, simple repeats and masked regions as defined in UCSC tracks were also removed. Finally, samples with the mutation count above the 97.5 percentile of the mutation burden across the cohort were deemed unreliable and excluded for further analyses. We call the set of variants obtained after the application of these filters the full set. A more conservative subset of somatic mutations was generated from the full set of blood somatic mutations. To this end, we applied MosaicForecast, a software designed to phase mutations to polymorphisms with the aim of identifying somatic mutations in a small number of cells and also predict mosaicism for the unphased ones with a random forest classifier. As a result, we obtained a subset of mosaic-phased mutations, and a subset of mutations likely to be somatic (mosaic set).</p><p>In order to obtain access to this study, please first obtain access to TCGA study (<a href=""./study.cgi?study_id=phs000178"">phs000178</a>).</p>",Nuria Lopez-Bigas,,,Case Set,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.22.350140v1,DNMT3A;PPM1D;TET2,,8315.0,8315.0,GRU,Seq_DNA_SNP_MAF_Ind,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs002867,nan,nan,08b45a60-d713-49a2-b795-8f0d26942fb7,dbGaP

The molecular pathogenesis of DLBCL is associated with multiple genetic lesions that in part distinctly segregate with individual phenotypic subtypes, suggesting the involvement of distinct oncogenic pathways. However, the lesions identified so far likely represent only a fraction of those necessary for malignant transformation. In order to characterize the entire set of structural alterations present in the DLBCL genome, we have integrated next generation whole exome sequencing analysis of 6 DLBCL cases and genome-wide high-density SNP array analysis of 72 DLBCL cases. We report here that FL and DLBCL harbor frequent structural alterations inactivating <i>CREBBP</i> and, more rarely, <i>EP300</i>, two highly related histone and non-histone acetyltransferases (HATs) that act as transcriptional co-activators in multiple signaling pathways. Overall, ~37% of DLBCL and 36% of FL cases display genomic deletions and/or somatic point mutations that remove or inactivate the HAT coding domain of these two genes. These lesions commonly affect a single allele, suggesting that reduction in HAT dosage is important for lymphomagenesis. We demonstrate specific defects in the acetylation-mediated inactivation of the BCL6 oncoprotein and activation of the p53 tumor suppressor. These results identify <i>CREBBP/EP300</i> mutations as a major pathogenic mechanism shared by common forms of B-NHL, and have direct implications for the use of drugs targeting acetylation/deacetylation mechanisms.</p> <p><b>Version 2.</b> Follicular lymphoma (FL) is an indolent, but incurable disease that, in 30-40% of cases, undergoes transformation to an aggressive diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The history of clonal evolution and the mechanisms that underlie transformation to DLBCL (tFL) remain largely unknown. Using whole exome sequencing and copy number analysis of 39 tFL patients, including 12 with paired sequential FL/tFL biopsies, we show that, in most cases, FL and tFL arise by divergent evolution from a common mutated precursor cell through the acquisition of distinct genetic lesions. Mutations in epigenetic modifiers (e.g., <i>MLL2, CREBBP, EZH2, ARID1A</i>) and anti-apoptotic genes (<i>BCL2, FAS</i>) were observed in 93% (36/39) and 78% (30/39) of cases, respectively, and were invariably shared between the two disease phases, suggesting an early acquisition in the common mutated precursor. Conversely, the development of tFL is associated with deregulation of genes involved in the control of cell proliferation, cell cycle progression and DNA damage responses (<i>CDKN2A/2B, MYC, TP53</i>), as well as with an aberrant activity of the somatic hypermutation mechanism. Finally, we show that the genomic profile of tFL shares significant similarities with that of germinal center B-cell type <i>de novo</i> DLBCL, but also displays unique combinations of altered genes that may explain the dismal clinical course of tFL.</p><p><b>Version 3. </b>This version includes thirty-five additional de novo DLBCL samples, newly diagnosed, and their paired normal DNA from previously untreated patients, which were analyzed by whole exome sequencing (n=27T and 25N), whole genome sequencing (8T and 10N), and/or targeted HLA-next generation sequencing (n=26T/N pairs) in order to identify genetic alterations associated with loss of surface MHC-II expression.</p>",Riccardo Dalla-Favera;Laura Pasqualucci,21390126;21804550;21156281;19412164;24388756;35794478,PO1-CA-092625;RO1 CA-37295,Case-Control;Tumor vs. Matched-Normal,,,"Lymphoma, Follicular;Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin",194.0,333.0,DS-CA-PUB-MDS,WXS;Array_SNP;WGS;Targeted-Capture,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000328,nan,nan,91905f38-5027-4e81-9a6f-2e92af63b3b5,dbGaP

High tumor mutation burden (TMB) and high levels of tumor-infiltrating T cells have been associated with response to immunotherapy, and integrative models using DNA and RNA have improved predictions of clinical benefit. However, identification of immune and tumor-intrinsic features in models using DNA or RNA alone have not been comprehensively explored in melanoma. In this study, we sequenced DNA and RNA of tumors from 67 melanoma patients receiving CPB, and aggregated this cohort with previously published data, yielding whole exome sequencing (WES) data for 189 patients and bulk RNA sequencing data for 178 patients. Using these datasets, we derived genomic and transcriptomic factors that predict overall survival (OS) and response to immunotherapy. Using whole exome DNA data alone, we calculated T cell burden (TCB) and B cell burden (BCB) based on rearranged TCR/Ig DNA sequences, and found that melanoma patients with high TMB and either high TCB or high BCB survived longer and had higher response rates, as compared to patients with low TMB and either low TCB or low BCB. Next, using bulk RNA-Seq data, differential expression analysis identified 83 genes which are associated with high or low OS. By combining pairs of immune-expressed genes with tumor-expressed genes, we identified three gene pairs which are associated with response and survival (Bonferroni P&lt;0.05). All three gene pair models were validated in an independent cohort (n=180) (Bonferroni P&lt;0.05).

Although the variation of PrCa incidence is likely to be the result of several factors, there is a large body of literature that strongly implicates a genetic etiology. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have emerged as the most widely used contemporary approach to identify genetic variants (in particular SNPs) that are associated with increased risk of human disease. For PrCa, at least five GWAS have now been performed yielding a substantial number of well-validated SNPs that are associated with an increased risk of PrCa, and that number continues to grow. A significant problem for many of the PrCa risk-SNPs identified so far, however, is that they do not lie within or near a known gene and they have no obvious functional properties. These findings suggest that many (if not most) of these risk-SNPs will be located in regulatory regions that control gene expression rather than in coding regions that may directly affect protein function. Therefore, in order to define the functional role of currently known risk-SNPs, the target genes must first be identified. A promising strategy to address this problem involves the use of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis. Unfortunately, most of the publically available SNP-Transcript eQTL datasets utilize lymphoblastoid cells with only a handful using tissue from target organs. Although useful, these datasets alone are unlikely to be sufficient. Recent studies have demonstrated that gene expression and gene regulation occur in both a tissue-specific and tissue independent fashion and suggest that a complete repertoire of regulatory SNPs can only be uncovered in the context of cell type specificity.

Driver germline and somatic mutations, TMB, neoantigen, and immune cell signatures were analyzed using whole exome sequencing (WES) and transcriptome sequencing of tumor and WES of matched germline DNA in a cohort of 66 glioma samples (44 IDH-mutant and 22 IDH-wildtype). Fourteen samples revealed a hypermutator phenotype (HMP). Eight pathogenic (P) or likely pathogenic (LP) germline variants were detected in 9 (19%) patients. Six of these 8 genes were DNA damage repair genes. P/LP germline variants were found in 22% of IDH-mutant gliomas and 12.5%of IDH-wildtype gliomas (p= 0.7).  TMB was correlated with expressed neoantigen but showed an inverse correlation with immune score (R =&#8722;0.46, p= 0.03) in IDH-wildtype tumors and no correlation in IDH-mutant tumors. Antigen Processing and Presentation (APP) score correlates with immune score. The APP is higher in non-hypermutator phenotype (NHMP) samples versus HMP samples in the IDH-wildtype gliomas, but higher in HMP samples versus NHMP samples in the IDH-mutant gliomas. Conclusion: TMB was inversely correlated with the immune score in the IDH-wildtype gliomas, and showed no correlation in the IDH-mutant tumors.

While most patients are cured, those with disease arising in the mediastinum have distinctly poor outcomes. One in every 17 patients with primary mediastinal non-seminomatous GCTs develop an incurable hematologic malignancy and prior data intriguingly suggests a clonal relationship exists between hematologic malignancies and GCTs in these cases. To date however, the precise clonal relationship between GCTs and the diverse additional somatic malignancies arising in such individuals has not been determined. Here, we traced the clonal evolution and characterized the genetic features of each neoplasm from a cohort of fifteen patients with GCTs and associated hematologic malignancies. We discovered that GCTs and hematologic malignancies developing in such individuals evolved from a common shared precursor, nearly all of which harbored allelically imbalanced TP53 and/or RAS pathway mutations. Hematologic malignancies arising in this setting genetically resembled mediastinal GCTs rather than <i>de novo</i> myeloid neoplasms. Our findings argue that this scenario represents a unique clinical syndrome, distinct from <i>de novo</i> GCTs or hematologic malignancies, initiated by an ancestral precursor which gives rise to the parallel evolution of GCTs and blood cancers in these patients.</p> <p>Reprinted from PMID: 32897884, with permission from JCI. </p>","Omar Abdel-Wahab, MD;Darren Feldman, MD",32897884,1K08CA230319-01;The Marie-Josee and Henry R.

Recent studies of massive parallel sequencing of tumor cells obtained from the BM of patients with MM have demonstrated significant clonal heterogeneity in MM. Despite this remarkable clonal heterogeneity, it could be envisioned that such clonal diversity may be even higher since single BM samples only represent a small fraction of the whole BM compartment, and the pattern of BM infiltration in MM is typically patchy. In addition, BM biopsies are painful and cannot be repeated multiple times during the course of therapy, indicating a need for less invasive methods to molecularly characterize MM patients and monitor disease progression during the therapy. Thus, optimal characterization of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) may represent a non-invasive method to capture relevant mutations present in PC clones.</p> <p>In addition, MM almost always progresses from precursor states of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS)/smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM) to overt MM. However, some patients rapidly progress from MGUS/SMM to overt MM (progressors) with a rate of progression of up to 70% over 5 years, while others remain indolent with minimal progression over the same time period (non-progressors). Although many patients are diagnosed with earlier phases of disease, most patients do not receive treatment until their disease progresses, at which time they have overt end-organ damage. This concept of initiating therapy at the time of symptomatic disease is analogous to initiating therapy in patients with solid tumors only after the development of measurable metastatic disease. It is therefore not surprising that cure is not achieved for most patients with MM.</p> <p>Interestingly, studies have demonstrated that MGUS/SMM clones may already harbor chromosomal alterations (Ig loci or hyperdiploidy) and that progression to MM is mainly due to expansion of clones that were already present in the early stages of MGUS/SMM. However, the biological factors that discriminate progressors from non-progressors in MGUS/SMM are not well known.</p> <p>Therefore, our overarching hypothesis is that an effective therapeutic intervention will result from defining genomic and transcriptomic markers that are associated with disease progression. We believe, therefore, that focused research studies that define molecular mechanisms of clonal evolution in MGUS/SMM/MM will identify novel biomarkers of disease progression and help develop therapeutic agents that prevent or delay progression from MGUS to overt MM. Indeed, by eradicating the disease at the precursor stages, MM may become a preventable disease.</p> <p>Recently, a new term called Clonal Hematopoiesis of Indeterminate Potential (CHIP) has been proposed to describe asymptomatic individuals with hematologic malignancy-associated somatic mutations. Those individuals do not fulfill any diagnostic criteria for any hematological malignancy yet they have a tendency to progress into myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or myeloid or lymphoid neoplasia at a rate of around 0.5-1% per year, similar to MGUS. The frequency of CHIP and role of HSCs mutations in enhancing acquisition of somatic mutations in MM plasma cells, allowing progression following treatment, has not been studied. Investigating the dysregulated pathways in early progenitor cells would allow us to understand the reasons of progression and establish novel therapeutic and potentially preventive strategies.</p> <p>This study dissects genomic and transcriptomic characteristics of clonal evolution from MGUS/SMM to MM as well as the characteristics of the tumor microenvironment/immune cells/peripheral blood. Our hypothesis is that molecular biomarkers will be strong predictors of progression from MGUS/SMM to MM and will allow for the development of novel therapeutic agents that prevent or delay this progression. We aim to define genomic and transcriptomic markers that lead to progression from MGUS/SMM to MM in tumor cells, blood biopsies (cell free DNA and circulating tumor cells), and the tumor microenvironment.</p>",Irene M.

Here, we report two distinctive groups defined by metabolites; a TNBC-HIGH group that shows high levels of pyrimidine pathway metabolites and biosynthetic enzymes, and an ER-HIGH group that shows high levels of fatty acid and arginine biosynthesis intermediates. We identify different metabolic enrichment profiles between cell lines grown in vitro vs. in vivo; cell lines grown in vivo recapitulate patient tumors metabolic profiles. Further, we identify a subset of genes that strongly correlates with the TNBC-HIGH metabolic profile using integrated metabolic and gene expression profiling, which strongly predicts patient prognosis when tested on larger human datasets. As a proof-of-principle, when we target TNBC-HIGH metabolic dysregulation with a pyrimidine biosynthesis inhibitor (Brequinar), and/or a glutaminase inhibitor (CB-839), we observe therapeutic efficacy and decreased tumor growth in representative TNBC cell lines, murine p53-null mammary tumors, and in vivo patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) upon multi-agent drug treatment.

To understand the influences of genetic ancestry on tumor genomic alterations, the authors estimated the genetic ancestry of 1001 previously described patients (Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform) with DLBCL using unsupervised model-based Admixture global ancestry analysis applied to exome sequencing data and examined the mutational profile of DLBCL driver genes in tumors obtained from this cohort. Global ancestry prediction identified 619 patients with &gt;90% European ancestry, 81 patients with &gt;90% African ancestry, and 50 patients with &gt;90% Asian ancestry. Compared with patients with DLBCL with European ancestry, patients with African ancestry were aged &gt;10 years younger at the time of diagnosis and were more likely to present with B symptoms, elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase, extranodal disease, and advanced stage disease. Patients with African ancestry demonstrated worse overall survival compared with patients with European ancestry (median, 4.9 years vs 8.8 years; P=.04). Distinct prevalence and patterns of mutation highlight an important difference in the mutational landscapes of DLBCL arising in different ancestry groups. This study has the potential to identify genes that contribute to increased DLBCL risk in African Americans and may have implications for tailored treatment of DLBCL in African Americans.</p><p>1001 DLBCL genomic data was downloaded from the European Genome-Phenome Archive (EGA) website (<a href=""https://ega-archive.org/datasets/EGAD00001003600"" target=""_blank"">https://ega-archive.org/datasets/EGAD00001003600</a>).&nbsp;</p>","Christopher Flowers, MD",28985567;32469082,K24 CA208132/NIH/NCI,Cohort,,,African Continental Ancestry Group,,,nan,nan,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs002434,nan,nan,1f58c15b-5655-403a-9099-a2863c721c58,dbGaP

In addition, we showed that FGF8 is expressed in human rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines that express P3F. We also demonstrated that FGF8 contributes to their proliferation and transformation in vitro, and is sufficient to maintain their oncogenicity after the loss of P3F expression.

phs001163,CRU-Ukrainian National Research Center for Radiation Medicine Trio Study,Germ-Line Mutation,2021-06-17,,Not Provided,"<p>Data on transgenerational effects following nuclear accidents are important for understanding fully the consequences of parental exposure to ionizing radiation. Few studies to date have had adequate statistical power to detect effects of the magnitude expected based on animal data, and most have not been of low-dose, protracted exposures associated with nuclear accidents and their aftermath. Although, to date, scant use has been made of the new genomic technologies, in Chernobyl-exposed areas of Ukraine and Belarus, excess minisatellite mutations have been seen in children born after the accident. We propose a study of parent-child trios in which at least one parent was exposed to Chernobyl radiation as a clean-up worker (mean dose&#62;&#61;100 mGy) and&#47;or evacuee from a contaminated area (mean &#62;&#61;50 mGy). The specific aims are to investigate the transgenerational and de novo mutation rates of the spectrum of genetic variants in trios, in particular looking at effects in children and mapping them to possible parental origin of the chromsoome. Together with long-term collaborators at the Research Center for Radiation Medicine (RCRM) in Kiev, epidemiologic data will be collected for up to 450 trios of parents with preconceptional doses and their unexposed offspring. We will use state-of-the-art genomic technologies to characterize the landscape of the genomes of the trios to determine whether parental radiation exposure is associated with genetic mutations transmitted to the offspring, by examining de novo mutation rates, minisatellite mutations, copy number alterations, and variations in telomere length. The analysis will be conducted in peripheral blood and/or buccal samples (when blood is not available) from complete father-mother-child trios. Doses to the gonads from the time of the accident to the time of conception will be reconstructed for all parents using existing records supplemented by interview data.</p> <p>Trio subjects will be selected from representative populations exposed to radiation from Chernobyl who are under active follow-up in the Clinico-Epidemiologic Registry at RCRM. To help identify specific effects of paternal and maternal radiation exposure, we will initially select sets of trio subjects in five categories: (1) exposed father, unexposed mother; (2) unexposed father, exposed mother; (3) both parents exposed; (4) both parents unexposed; and (5) a group of high dose &#34;emergency workers&#34; with acute radiation syndrome. All trio members will be invited to the RCRM outpatient clinic for collection of a 20 ml blood sample (or buccal cells for those who refuse phlebotomy). Both parents will be asked to complete a general questionnaire to obtain demographic and lifestyle data. Then one or both will complete detailed dosimetry questionnaires, based on forms used in previous collaborations with RCRM and administered by specially trained interviewers. Once 50 trios have been recruited (10 from each of the 5 exposure categories), we will conduct an interim evaluation of participation rates, sample collection and quality, and dose reconstruction in order to modify the protocol as needed. The analytical approach will be to correlate the extent, especially for de novo events of genetic alterations in the offspring with parental pre-conceptional radiation dose overall and by parental origin. The statistical power in relation to de novo mutations is very high, in excess of 90&#37;, but somewhat lower for trends in minisatellite mutations. Study findings will contribute importantly to knowledge of the heritable effects of moderate- and low-dose radiation exposure in humans and to radiation risk projection.

phs001327,Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS),Neoplasms,2021-06-04,,"Bone Diseases; Cardiovascular Diseases; Cognitive Dysfunction; Dwarfism, Pituitary; Heart Failure; Infertility","<p><b>Background and Rationale for the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS)</b><br> Over the last several decades, advances in treatments for childhood and adolescent cancer have substantially improved survival following diagnosis. These improvements gave rise to the responsibility for investigating long-term treatment-associated morbidity and mortality. Early efforts to describe late effects were largely conducted through single-institution and limited consortia studies. However, by the mid-1980s, it became increasingly clear that these approaches had inherent limitations, including small sample size, convenience sampling, incompletely characterized populations, and limited length of follow-up. To overcome these limitations, the CCSS was proposed and funded by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) as a U01 grant in 1994. Subsequently, the strengths of the CCSS, including an efficient and extensive infrastructure, plus expanding database and biorepository, were recognized and appreciated. Thus, in consultation with the NCI, the CCSS was converted to a U24 (resource grant) funding mechanism to serve the scientific community in 2000. <br> The overarching goal of the CCSS resource is to increase the conduct of innovative and high impact research related to pediatric cancer survivorship. CCSS has been used extensively by researchers from a wide range of disciplines to address a broad spectrum of topics. Strengths of the resource include its large size, comprehensive annotation of treatment exposures, ongoing longitudinal follow-up with characterization of a wide array of participant characteristics and outcomes, and an established biorepository.</p> <p><b>Design of the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study</b><br> The Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS) is a multi-institutional, multi-disciplinary collaborative research resource comprised of a retrospective hospital-based cohort of survivors of childhood cancer and a comparison sibling cohort. Eligible survivors from 31 participating institutions were diagnosed between 1970 and 1999, prior to age 21 years, with selected common pediatric cancers (leukemia, central nervous system tumors, Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, kidney tumors, neuroblastoma, soft tissue sarcoma, or bone tumors). All patients who survived five years from the date of diagnosis were eligible, regardless of disease or treatment status. The baseline questionnaire was completed by 25,665 survivors and 5051 siblings recruited to serve as a comparison group. To date, participants have completed three general follow-up surveys, as well as a number of specialized surveys on specific topics (e.g. health care, insurance, screening practices, men's and women's health issues, adolescent health, sleep and fatigue). In addition, biological samples (buccal cells, saliva and/or blood) have been collected for over 11,000 participants. Full descriptions of the design and characteristics of the CCSS have been previously published (Robison et al; Leisenring et al.), and available data and samples are described at <a href=""https://ccss.stjude.org/develop-a-study/gwas-data-resource.html"" target=""_blank"">https://ccss.stjude.org/develop-a-study/gwas-data-resource.html.</a> </p> <p><b>Treatment Data in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study</b><br> A key feature of CCSS is the availability of detailed treatment data, which were collected by abstraction of medical records for each individual member of the cohort. Detailed abstraction included dates of therapy, protocol information, and specific details regarding surgery, chemotherapy and radiation. Quantitative dose details were collected for 22 specific chemotherapeutic agents, including alkylating agents, anthracyclines, platinum compounds and epipodophyllotoxins. In addition to individual agent doses, algorithms have been created to calculate cumulative doses of all drugs in a specific class, such as anthracyclines (doxorubicin, daunomycin and idarubicin) or platinum agents (cisplatinum and carboplatinum). Data abstracted for surgeries included dates and both the names and corresponding International Classification of Diseases (9th revision) code. For radiation treatment data, all relevant records were sent to the Radiation Physics Center at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center for detailed abstraction and dosimetry. Initial body region dosimetry was performed for all participants, followed by more detailed dosimetry as needed for specific studies.</p> <p><b>Genomics Data in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study</b><br>The NCI's Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics and CCSS investigators collaborated to conduct genomics studies (SNP array genotyping and whole exome sequencing) using samples from the CCSS Biorepository. Studies included all cohort participants with available DNA regardless of sex or ancestry when the genomics studies were initiated.</p> <p><b>Phenotype Data in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study</b><br> Vital status and cause of death for both participants and non-participants is determined via linkage with the National Death Index (NDI). Identification of subsequent neoplasms is based on self-report, followed by validation using medical records, or via NDI. A wide array of additional health outcomes have been ascertained via a comprehensive set of questions on the CCSS questionnaires, covering potential adverse events across a range of organ systems (hearing/vision/speech, urinary, hormonal, heart and circulatory, respiratory, digestive, brain and nervous systems). In addition to health outcomes, longitudinal data have been collected on demographics, health behaviors, family history, screening practices, insurance status, and a range of psychosocial and neurocognitive factors.

While approximately 35% of BWS cases are caused by isolated loss of methylation (LOM) at the human imprinting center 2 (IC2) on chromosome 11p15, only around 5% of patients develop BWS due to structural alterations to the IC2 domain. In this study, we identify a BWS-causing 7.6 kB familial deletion within the IC2 domain by performing Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) on patient-derived human fibroblasts.

We find that high-strength interactions occur within the IC2 domain between the 5&#39; end of <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3784"" target=""_blank"">KCNQ1</a>, KCNQ1 intron 2, and the 5&#39; end of <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1028"" target=""_blank"">CDKN1C</a> in the control profile that are largely abrogated in the BWS samples, but some lower frequency contacts between the imprinting control region (ICR), KCNQ1 intron 2, and the 5&#39; end of CDKN1C are unaffected. We conclude that the strong KCNQ1-CDKN1C interactions are important in maintaining the domain imprint.","Jennifer  M.

RMS, the most common soft-tissue sarcoma in children and adolescents, has one of the poorest 5-year survival rates among all pediatric cancers (less than 65%). One of the strongest risk factors for RMS is having a cancer predisposition syndrome. The syndromes that are most commonly seen among those with RMS are Li-Fraumeni, neurofibromatosis type 1, Costello, Noonan, and DICER1. Based on smaller clinic-based studies, only about 7% of RMS cases are thought to be associated with the genes responsible for these syndromes. However, there have been no population-based assessments to support this estimate. Even in the most recent large-scale evaluations of germline mutations in predisposition genes among children with cancer, very few RMS cases were included (43 cases). Furthermore, no distinctions were made between the major histologic subtypes of RMS: embryonal (eRMS) and alveolar (aRMS), which display differences in terms of age distribution, incidence, and cytogenetics. For instance, nearly 80% of alveolar cases are driven by a chromosomal translocation between either PAX3 or PAX7 and FOXO1, whereas these fusions are not seen in embryonal cases. In fact, RMS research is shifting from categorization based on histology to fusion status (eRMS is overwhelmingly fusion-negative). Another limitation in previous studies has been the inability to evaluate the frequency of de novo germline mutations (DNMs) in cancer predisposition genes due to the absence of any well-characterized cohorts of RMS case-parent trios. Therefore, a major gap in our understanding of the role of cancer predisposition in pediatric RMS that limit translational impact is there have been no population-based assessments to determine the true impact of these mutations on pediatric RMS, which limits clinical sequencing guidelines and surveillance protocols in these children.<br><br>Overall Project Strategy: The objective of this project is to advance our understanding of the relationship between cancer predisposition genes and pediatric RMS. Our central hypotheses are: 1) mutations in cancer predisposition genes are more common than expected in children with RMS; and 2) children with fusion-negative tumors have a higher burden of germline mutations than those with fusion-positive tumors. The framework for this study relies on &gt;600 well annotated samples collected from newly diagnosed RMS patients and stored in the Children&#39;s Oncology Group (COG) Biopathology Center.<br><br>",Philip J.

Up to 50% of patients develop distant metastases, but current systemic therapies have limited efficacy. MFS and UPS have recently been shown to commonly harbor copy number alterations or mutations in the tumor suppressor genes <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5925"">RB1</a> and <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7157"">TP53</a>. As these alterations have been shown to engender dependence on the oncogenic protein Skp2 for survival of transformed cells in mouse models, we sought to examine its function and potential as a therapeutic target in MFS/UPS. Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) and next-generation sequencing (NGS) confirmed that a significant fraction of MFS and UPS patient samples (n=94) harbor chromosomal deletions and/or loss-of-function mutations in RB1 and TP53 (88% carry alterations in at least one gene; 60% carry alterations in both).

Downregulation of SKP2 or treatment with Skp2 Inhibitor C1 revealed that Skp2 drives proliferation of patient-derived MFS/UPS cell lines deficient in both Rb and p53 by degrading p21 and p27. Inhibition of Skp2 using the neddylation-activating enzyme (NAE) inhibitor pevonedistat decreased growth of Rb/p53-negative patient-derived cell lines and mouse xenografts. These results demonstrate that loss of both Rb and p53 renders MFS and UPS dependent on Skp2, which can be therapeutically exploited and could provide the basis for promising novel systemic therapies for MFS and UPS.</p>","Samuel Singer, MD FACS",,P50 CA140146;P30 CA008748,Case Set,,CDKN1A;PSMD9;RB1;SKP2;TP53,"Histiocytoma, Malignant Fibrous",62.0,62.0,GRU,WXS,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs001982,nan,nan,8d540ee7-c8c1-4d14-9f5b-e5e01aa69024,dbGaP

phs001307,Inherited Genetic Variation and Predisposition to Testicular Germ Cell    Tumor: UPenn Local TGCT Study,Testicular Germ Cell Tumor,2021-04-13,,Seminoma,"<p>Testicular germ cell tumors (TGCT) are the most common cancer in men ages 20-40. The incidence of TGCT has more than doubled over the past forty years, without clear etiology. Both genetic effects and environmental exposures, specifically during the pre-natal period, are likely to play an important role in determining TGCT susceptibility. TGCT is known to develop from primordial germ cells (PGCs). We hypothesize that variation in genes that impact upon the differentiation and maturation of PGCs will be important determinants of TGCT susceptibility and based on this hypothesis have selected three important pathways for study, i) male germ cell development, ii) androgen and estrogen biosynthesis and metabolism, and iii) IGF signaling. The proteins involved in early male germ cell development, normally only expressed in PGCs, are markers of and are overexpressed in TGCT. Markers of increased exposure to estrogen (or relatively decreased exposure to androgen) in utero and exogenous estrogen exposures, such as endocrine disruptors, have been associated with TGCT case status in multiple studies. IGF signaling is necessary for testis differentiation and maturation in mice and interacts synergistically with the estrogen signaling pathway. Additionally, we are interested in examining genetic factors predisposing to TGCT in an unbiased fashion, and thus will conduct a Genome Wide Association Study. As well disease susceptiblity, genetics are likely to play a role in disease progression, disease outcomes and response to treatement. We will also assess association of inherited genetics with these outcomes. We will analyze the contribution of genetic variants in these pathways to TGCT risk using a population-based case-control study in the Philadelphia metropolitian area. Our goal is the collection of 550 TGCT cases and 1100 age, race and cell phone use matched controls without a history of TGCT, which will yield 500 and 1000 white cases and controls, respectively, available for final analyses. All cases will be enumerated through the New Jersey and Pennsylvania state cancer registries. We will use a two-tiered approach for case recruitment: hospital clinic-based followed by registry-based. Hospital based cases will be identified within the Univeristy of Pennsylvania Health System and the University of Pennsylvania Cancer Network. All cases identified through this mechanism will be recruited irregardless of diagnosis date. The remaining cases will be identified through the New Jersey and Pennsylvania cancer registries and contacted following their protocols.</p> <p>Controls will be identified through random digit dialing and address based sampling. Both cases and controls will complete a questionnaire addressing known, presumed, and hypothesized risk factors for TGCT and provide a biospecimen. Pathological slides will be reviewed to cases to confirm diagnostic sub-type of TGCT. Haplotypes and functional SNPs will be typed in the genes of interest, as well as throughout the genome. Analyses will be conducted for specific variants, common haplotypes, alone and in conjunction with each other and exposure data after appropriate adjustment for potential confounders. The findings from this study will greatly contribute to our understanding of determinants of TGCT susceptibility.</p>","Katherine Nathanson, MD",24943593;24008901;23666239;23547758;23462292;23248619;21551455;19483682,R01-CA-114478,Case-Control,,,Seminoma,1397.0,1400.0,DS-CA-MDS,Array_SNP,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs001307,nan,nan,94f38010-69ac-4b60-8d54-9402339c3268,dbGaP

With the exception of p53, single nucleotide variant mutations (here, simply ""mutations"") are not drivers of 80% of tumors within the most frequent and deadly histotype of ovarian cancer: serous ovarian cancer (SOC). Rather, CNAs are more prevalent in SOC than any other cancer type studied by <a href=""./study.cgi?study_id=phs000178"">phs000178</a> The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Fully two-thirds of genes are altered by CNAs in the average SOC. Bioinformatic methods have shown that these CNAs modulate specific molecular pathways, such as autophagy, and this finding enabled effective pathway-targeted therapies1. Unfortunately, TCGA ovarian cancer data lacks racial diversity. Only 6% of SOC tumors (n=32) studied are from African origin. Black women diagnosed with ovarian cancer are more likely to die from their disease than white women. Five-year survival after diagnosis is 31% among blacks versus 42% among whites, and this disparity is seen in every age group and tumor stage distribution. Dr. Kelemen examined data from 365 white and 95 black ovarian cancer patients from the Hollings Cancer Center (HCC) Cancer Registry between 2000 and 2015 and found that black women had an 81% higher risk of death after diagnosis compared to white women (HR 1.81, 95% CI 1.35-2.43), independent of diagnosis center (98% were treated at HCC but half were diagnosed elsewhere), tumor stage, histology, extent of residual tumor remaining following surgery, insurance status, smoking, type of treatment for ovarian cancer, and age-adjusted Charlson comorbidity index. This disparity remained even when restricted to women who received the standard of care, surgery-chemotherapy sequence (HR 1.79, 95% CI 1.10-2.89). Despite receiving the same treatment, black race was still associated with inferior survival. A similar disparity has been reported by others, indicating that the HCC experience is representative of national data. Here, an additional set of high-grade serous ovarian cancer primary tumors were acquired from biorepositories with a focus on expanding data originating from African American women.

CD47 is expressed at different levels in normal cells, however, in cancer cells, CD47 transcript and protein expression is aberrantly increased. Here we sought to uncover the regulators of <i>CD47</i> transcription, including active enhancers that increase its aberrant expression in cancer cells, in order to reveal mechanisms by which different neoplastic cells generate this dominant &#39;don&#39;t eat me&#39; signal. Enhancers are genomic regions, often referred to as ""switches"", that can turn on or off the transcription of target genes. Recently the discovery of super-enhancers (SEs) has given more insight into the regulatory architecture of key genes that are highly expressed in a specific cell type, during a particular developmental stage or in disease. By analyzing the <i>CD47</i> regulatory genomic landscape, we discovered: i) A distinct super-enhancer (SE) is associated with <i>CD47</i> upregulation in breast cancer cells ii) Disruption of <i>CD47</i> SEs by using the BRD4 inhibitor JQ1 robustly reduces <i>CD47</i> gene expression; and iii) The TNF-NFKB1 signaling pathway is directly involved in the regulation of CD47 by interacting with a distal downstream constituent enhancer located within a <i>CD47</i>-associated SE specific to breast cancer.

GAPPS, first described in 2012, is an autosomal dominant gastric polyposis syndrome that confers a substantial risk for gastric adenocarcinoma. The GAPPS phenotype consists of a carpeting of greater than 100 fundic gland polyps (FGPs) in the oxyntic mucosa of the gastric body and fundus, with antral sparing with some FGPs displaying high-grade dysplasia. This is in contrast to sporadic FGPs that are benign, most often are not associated with high-grade dysplasia though low-grade dysplasia has been reported, and are fewer in number. Gastric FGPs have been found to be associated with Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP) and attenuated FAP, which is an autosomal dominant condition associated with germ line mutations in APC which confers a phenotype consisting of multiple (&gt;100) adenomatous polyps in the colon and rectum developing after the first decade of life. FGPs are reported to occur in 12-84% of patients with FAP, whereas sporadic FGPs are identified in ~5% of patients undergoing upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. Gastric adenocarcinoma arising from FGPs in individuals with FAP have been reported. Other manifestations of FAP and AFAP include polyps in the upper gastrointestinal tract, congenital hypertrophy of retinal pigment epithelium, osteomas and epidermoid cysts, supernumerary teeth, desmoid formation, and other malignancies such as thyroid, small bowel cancer, hepatoblastoma, and medulloblastoma.

phs002037,Methylation Biomarker Study of Magnesium Deficiency and Colorectal Cancer,Magnesium Deficiency,2021-02-10,,"DNA Methylation; Deficiencies, Magnesium; Deficiency, Magnesium; Magnesium Deficiencies","<p>Five US studies using the Mg tolerance test, the ""gold standard"" test of Mg status, indicated that &gt;50% participants had Mg deficiency. In our ongoing US trial, we have found a similar result. In growing recognition of the importance of Mg in human health, very recently, Mg was selected by the US Federal Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) Committee to update the DRI. In US and other populations at high risk of Mg deficiency, high Mg intake has been linked to reduced risk of colorectal neoplasia, insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Conversely, in populations not at high risk of Mg deficiency, high Mg intake has been related to increased risk of total mortality (e.g. total cancer, colorectal cancer, and CVD), particularly when calcium intake is low. These observations suggest that the associations between high Mg intake and disease risks may completely differ by the underlying Mg status. Due to major limitations, the Mg tolerance test is not used in conventional clinical practice and rarely used in research. Instead, serum Mg is used for clinical diagnosis. However, serum Mg performs very poorly at identifying those with Mg deficiency. There is a great need to develop implementable, sensitive, and specific biomarkers which can be easily used for identifying people with Mg deficiency. Without such a marker, it is impossible to develop effective strategies that minimize adverse effects by targeting those who, as a result of Mg deficiency, are at risk of common diseases. It is known that DNA methylation changes are inducible by environmental exposures, including nutrients, and reversible when the exposure disappears. There are two major types of cytosine modifications in DNA, 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) and 5-methylcytosine (5-mC). 5-mC is often associated with suppressed gene expression. 5-hmC, generated by the oxidation of 5-mC, is specifically enriched in expressed genes and plays a critical role in activating and/or maintaining gene expression. However, current epigenomic profiling platforms cannot distinguish 5-hmC from 5-mC. Just recently, our collaborator, Dr. Chuan He (HHMI Investigator), established a novel and state of the art technique, TAB-Seq and TAB-Array protocol, which can separate 5-hmC from 5-mC in the genome. Our pilot studies indicate that Mg intake or treatment significantly affects methylation capacity, 5-mC and 5-hmC biomarkers. Our findings suggest blood leukocyte 5-hmC/5-mC biomarkers may serve as more sensitive biomarkers to identify Mg deficiency than serum Mg. Thus, a comprehensive epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) may help to identify the most sensitive 5-hmC/ 5- mC biomarkers for Mg deficiency. We propose to identify 5-hmC/5-mC biomarkers for Mg deficiency by a 4- phase EWAS study in the ""Personalized Prevention of Colorectal Cancer Trial [PPCCT, R01CA149633; PI, Dai and Yu]"" with a total of 240 participants. Mg tolerance test will be used as the gold standard. Finally, using newly identified biomarkers, we will evaluate if 12-week Mg treatment reduces TRPM7 expression, essential in Mg homeostasis and colorectal carcinogenesis, in rectal tissues only among those with Mg deficiency.</p>","Qi Dai, MD PhD",30541089;29607802;28501704;29263344;32280092,R01CA202936,Randomized;Clinical Trial,,,DNA Methylation,240.0,476.0,NRUP;GRU,Array_DNA_Methylation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs002037,nan,nan,6cea8f69-4b79-45e1-90b4-1c4216c5872d,dbGaP

The ability to detect somatic mutations in plasma depends on both assay sensitivity and the fraction of circulating DNA in plasma that is tumor-derived (i.e cfDNA tumor fraction). We hypothesized that cfDNA tumor fraction could inform the interpretation of negative cfDNA results and guide the choice of subsequent assays of greater genomic breadth or depth. Plasma samples collected from 118 metastatic cancer patients were analyzed with cf-IMPACT, a modified version of the FDA-authorized MSK-IMPACT tumor test that can detect genomic alterations in 410 cancer-associated genes. Shallow whole genome sequencing (sWGS) was also performed in the same samples to estimate cfDNA tumor fraction based on genome-wide copy number alterations using z-score statistics. The results show that cfDNA tumor fraction can inform the interpretation of negative cfDNA results and guide the selection of subsequent sequencing platforms that are most likely to identify clinically-relevant  genomic alterations.</p><p><br></p>",David B.

We investigated the landscape of ccRCCs and paired normal kidney tissues (NKTs) using integrated transcriptomic, metabolomic and metallomic approaches in a cohort of never smokers (NS) and long-term current smokers (LTS) Caucasian males. <br><br><b>Results</b>. All three Omics domains consistently identified a distinct metabolic subtype of ccRCCs in LTS, characterized by activation of oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) coupled with reprogramming of the malate-aspartate shuttle and metabolism of aspartate, glutamate, glutamine and histidine. Cadmium, copper and inorganic arsenic accumulated in LTS tumors showing redistribution among intracellular pools, including relocation of copper into the cytochrome c oxidase complex. Gene expression signature based on the LTS metabolic subtype provided prognostic stratification of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) ccRCC tumors that was independent from genomic alterations.<br><br><b>Conclusions</b>. The work identified the TS related metabolic subtype of ccRCC with vulnerabilities that can be exploited for precision medicine approaches targeting metabolic pathways. The results provided rationale for the development of metabolic biomarkers with diagnostic and prognostic applications using evaluation of OxPhos status.

phs001787,Discovery of Colorectal Cancer Susceptibility Genes in High-Risk Families,"Colorectal Neoplasms, Hereditary Nonpolyposis",2020-12-22,,Familial Nonpolyposis Colon Cancer,"<p>Colorectal cancer remains one of the most common cancers in the US with 146,970 new diagnoses and 49,920 deaths estimated for 2009. Colon cancer is also one of the most familial of cancers. Individuals with a first-degree relative with colon cancer have a 2- to 3-fold increased risk, and those with more than one first-degree relative with colon cancer, or a single first-degree relative affected at age 50 years, have a 3- to 6-fold greater risk than those with no family history. The most prominent high-risk colorectal cancer susceptibility genes, <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/324"">APC</a>, <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4292"">MLH1</a>, <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4436"">MSH2</a>, <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2956"">MSH6</a>, and <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5728"">PTEN</a>, were all discovered more than a decade ago. Currently, mutation screening of these genes, plus a short list of additional genes that are responsible for a very small fraction of colorectal cancer, plays an important role in the clinical management of individuals with a strong family history of the disease or syndromic evidence for the presence of a gene mutation.</p> <p>At the other end of the risk spectrum, genome-wide association studies have identified a number of common alleles with very modest effects on colorectal cancer risk; their clinical utility has yet to be established. However, taken together, the known spectrum of genetic effects only explain about one quarter of the overall familial excess of colorectal cancer. It should be emphasized that, at present, the vast majority of individuals seen at familial cancer clinics are counseled on the basis of their family history alone because they do not have mutations in the known susceptibility genes. Accordingly, the long-term objective of this project is to identify the majority of genes responsible for the unexplained component of inherited colorectal cancer risk. Nextgen DNA sequencing is well suited for application to research questions in genetic susceptibility for which linkage analysis is confounded by extensive genetic heterogeneity. Taking advantage of unparalleled familial cancer genetics resources available through the Utah Population Database, candidate genes have been identified by sequencing all of the gene exons in the human genome from a series of colorectal cancer cases with a very strong family history of colorectal cancer not explained by one of the currently known high-risk susceptibility genes.</p>","Sean Vahram Tavtigian, PhD",2841598;12761718;10891514;21970370;19781682;21244692;21700766;22464251,R01CA164138,Case Set,,,,242.0,206.0,NRUP;DS-CA-MDS,WXS;Array_SNP,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs001787,nan,nan,c99af718-d4a0-4187-8b1d-b0235623f2a0,dbGaP

phs001831,Elucidating Transcription Regulation by Epigenetics in Neuroblastoma,Neuroblastoma,2020-12-09,,Not Provided,"<p><b>PURPOSE</b><br/> Whole-genome profiles of the epigenetic modification 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) are robust diagnostic biomarkers in adult patients with cancer. We investigated if 5-hmC profiles would serve as novel prognostic markers in neuroblastoma, a clinically heterogeneous pediatric cancer. Because this DNA modification facilitates active gene expression, we hypothesized that 5-hmC profiles would identify transcriptomic networks driving the clinical behavior of neuroblastoma. </p> <p><b>PATIENTS AND METHODS</b><br/> Nano-hmC-Seal sequencing was performed on DNA from Discovery (n &#61; 51), Validation (n &#61; 38), and Children&#39;s Oncology Group (n &#61; 20) cohorts of neuroblastoma tumors. RNA was isolated from 48 tumors for RNA sequencing. Genes with differential 5-hmC or expression between clusters were identified using DESeq2. A 5-hmC model predicting outcome in high-risk patients was established using linear discriminant analysis. </p> <p><b>RESULTS</b><br/> Comparison of low- versus high-risk tumors in the Discovery cohort revealed 577 genes with differential 5-hmC. Hierarchical clustering of tumors from the Discovery and Validation cohorts using these genes identified two main clusters highly associated with established prognostic markers, clinical risk group, and outcome. Genes with increased 5-hmC and expression in the favorable cluster were enriched for pathways of neuronal differentiation and KRAS activation, whereas genes involved in inflammation and the PRC2 complex were identified in the unfavorable cluster. The linear discriminant analysis model trained on high-risk Discovery cohort tumors was prognostic of outcome when applied to high-risk tumors from the Validation and Children&#39;s Oncology Group cohorts (hazard ratio, 3.8). </p> <p><b>CONCLUSION</b><br/> 5-hmC profiles may be optimal DNA-based biomarkers in neuroblastoma. Analysis of transcriptional networks regulated by these epigenomic modifications may lead to a deeper understanding of drivers of neuroblastoma phenotype. </p> <p>&#34;Reprinted from Applebaum et.

phs002269,A New Pipeline to Predict and Confirm Tumor Neoantigens Predicts Better    Response to Checkpoint Blockade,"Antigens, Neoplasm",2020-11-04,,Not Provided,"Mutations that drive oncogenesis in cancer can generate neoantigens that may be recognized by the immune system. Identification of these neoantigens remains challenging due to the complexity of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigen and T-cell receptor interaction. Here we describe the development of a systematic approach to efficiently identify and validate immunogenic neoantigens. Whole exome sequencing of tissue from a melanoma patient was used to identify nonsynonymous mutations, followed by MHC binding prediction and identification of tumor clonal architecture. The top 18 putative class I neoantigens were selected for immunogenicity testing via a novel <i>in vitro</i> pipeline in HLA-A201 healthy donor blood. Naive CD8 T cells from donors were stimulated with allogeneic dendritic cells pulsed with peptide pools and then with individual peptides. The presence of antigen-specific T cells was determined via functional assays. We identified one putative neoantigen that expanded T cells specific to the mutant form of the peptide and validated this pipeline in a subset of patients with bladder tumors treated with durvalumab (N = 5). Within this cohort, the top predicted neoantigens from all patients were immunogenic <i>in vitro</i>. Finally, we looked at overall survival in the whole durvalumab-treated bladder cohort (N = 37) by stratifying patients by tertile measure of tumor mutation burden (TMB) or neoantigen load. Patients with higher neoantigen and TMB load tended to show better overall survival.",Nicholas Durham,,,Case Set,,,,37.0,37.0,GRU,WXS,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs002269,nan,nan,6d3c93ed-7ba9-4119-84c1-bbc52fc29395,dbGaP

The study included 40 cases with BE with non-cancer outcomes, ""NCO"", who did not progress to esophageal adenocarcinoma (EA), and 40 controls who progressed to an endoscopically detected, incident EA (cancer outcome, ""CO""). For each patient, two timepoints were evaluated (T1 and T2). NCO were matched to CO based on age at T1 (T1=first endoscopy with sufficient sample availability), and time between T1 and T2 (T2 in CO=time of diagnosis of incident EA). In 10 NCO, a third time point (T3), a mean of 13.2 years after T1, was also sequenced. Mapped endoscopic biopsies, at 1/3 and 2/3 annotated distances from the gastroesophageal junction within the Barrett's segment, were sampled per patient at each timepoint. Each biopsy was purified to separate BE epithelium from stroma, and DNA was extracted from purified epithelium for 60X WGS and 2.5M SNP array; normal control blood (N=62) or normal gastric sample (N=18) were analyzed by 30X WGS and 2.5M SNP array.

Project 1 will focus on discovery, expansion, and replication. By pooling GWAS, we expect to identify new associations and achieve independent replication, explore whether there are risk variants specific for histologic subtypes, and evaluate structural polymorphisms - copy number variants - as risk factors. Finally, Project 1 will leverage the GWAS data to correlate DNA variants with a new endpoint - survival. Project 2 will focus on biological studies designed to help inform interpretation of findings from Project 1. This will include efforts to identify the functional consequences of variants and improve understanding of biological mechanisms. Project 3 will include epidemiologic studies of gene by gene interaction, gene by environment interaction, and development of risk prediction models. The collective effort builds upon the strengths and history of collaboration inherent in the Ovarian Cancer Association Consortium (OCAC), a multidisciplinary group comprised of epidemiologists, genetic epidemiologists, statistical geneticists, molecular and cell biologists and clinicians that was formed in 2005.</p> <p><b>The FOCI Cohort is utilized in the following dbGaP sub-studies.</b> To view genotypes, other molecular data, and derived variables collected in these sub-studies, please click on the following sub-studies below or in the ""Sub-studies"" box located on the right hand side of this top-level study page <a href=""study.cgi?study_id=phs001133"">phs001133</a> FOCI Cohort. <ul> <li><a href=""study.cgi?study_id=phs001131"">phs001131</a> Affymetrix Exome Chip</li> <li><a href=""study.cgi?study_id=phs001132"">phs001132</a> GWAS Meta Analysis</li> <li><a href=""study.cgi?study_id=phs001142"">phs001142</a> Mayo Omni Express</li> <li><a href=""study.cgi?study_id=phs001150"">phs001150</a> Mayo 2 5M</li> </ul> </p>","Thomas A.

These studies, while clinically informative, are unable to delineate mutation order as well as clonal architecture and complexity. To investigate the clonal framework of myeloid malignancies, the Single Cell Mutational Profiling in Myeloid Malignancies study was designed. This study performed sequencing of 148 samples from 117 adult patients diagnosed with clonal hematopoiesis (n = 21), myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN; n = 14), and acute myeloid leukemia (AML; n = 82) between 20 and 87 years of age. Sequencing of all samples was performed using the Tapestri single cell DNA sequencing platform from Mission Bio, Inc. The platform utilizes a custom amplicon panel covering 109 amplicons across 31 genes frequently mutated in myeloid malignancies (CH, MPN, AML). Using the single cell DNA sequencing data, we were capable of elucidating clonal architecture and clonal complexity in each sample. In a subset of samples, we also performed simultaneous single cell DNA sequencing and cell surface protein expression analysis using the Tapestri DNA + Protein platform. This study allowed us to determine the expression of 7 cell surface proteins (CD3, CD11b, CD19, CD34, CD38, CD45RA, and CD90) at single cell resolution.

Although its causative factors and underlying tumor biology remain unknown, risk factors such as chronic hepatitis B virus and/or hepatitis C virus infection are highly prevalent. Moreover, Mongolia has an extraordinarily high prevalence of hepatitis delta virus (HDV), more than ten times above the global estimate, which we hypothesize as a major driver of Mongolian hepatocarcinogenesis. By performing a comprehensive and integrative genomic characterization, we aimed to identify robust molecular subclasses and driver features informative of the etiology and progression of the disease. This study, the first one of this nature ever to be conducted on a Mongolian cohort, identifies similarities to previous studies performed on other populations (which reflect general characteristics of liver carcinogenesis) as well as unique features of Mongolian HCC.</p> <p><strong>Study Design and Methods:</strong> Clinical information and paired tumor/non-tumor liver tissue samples were obtained from 76 HCC patients undergoing surgery at the National Cancer Center of Mongolia. Transcriptome sequencing and whole exome sequencing were performed on all tumor and non-tumor samples, followed by bioinformatics processing and quality control. Consensus clustering and regularized Cox regression analyses were performed on transcriptome data. Driver mutations and mutational signatures were assessed. These results were compared to those from 373 HCC patients of different races and ethnicities and diverse etiologies. Furthermore, molecular subclass gene signatures from multiple previous studies were assessed for validation.</p> <p><strong>Results and Conclusions:</strong> Using a transcriptomics-based unsupervised approach, we identified four molecular subclasses among Mongolian HCC cases, which were associated with different patient survival outcomes. These molecular subclasses were mapped to signatures reported in other HCC cohorts, showing significant associations consistent with survival outcomes. A supervised analysis determined risk scores strongly associated with survival, consistent with the four molecular subclasses. Mutational signature analysis using recently published COSMIC and Environmental Agents Compendia identified signatures with distinct prevalence among HDV+ and HVD- groups. Signatures differentially associated with HDV+ include mutational patterns linked to alkylating agents (such as temozolomide), tobacco chewing and exposures to 1,8-Dinitropyrene and furan, whereas HDV- appeared differentially associated with aristolochic acid II. In addition to common driver mutations (TP53, CTNNB1) frequently found in pan-cancer analysis, Mongolian HCC exhibits several unique drivers (most notably GTF2IRD2B, PNRC2, and SPTA1), the latter of which may be linked to HDV infection.

Recently, subtypes of pancreatic cancer with different prognoses have been elaborated. However, the inability to model these subtypes has precluded mechanistic investigation of their origins. Here, we present an orthotopic xenotransplantation model of human patient-derived PDAC organoids in which organoids are grafted via direct injection into the pancreatic duct of immunocompromised (NSG) mice. Tumors that arise from these intraductally grafted organoids (IGOs) enable the distinction of the two main PDAC subtypes: intraepithelial neoplasms from this model progress in an indolent or invasive manner representing the classical or basal-like subtypes of PDAC, respectively, depending on which organoid they originate from. RNA-sequencing was used to characterize the tumors that resulted from IGO xenografts, and to compare the fast- and slow-progressing IGO tumors. Tumors generated using a traditional orthotopic xenograft model, in which organoids are injected into the parenchyma of the pancreas (i.e. orthotopically grafted organoids, or OGOs), were also sequenced for comparison with the IGO tumors. To further characterize the model, laser-capture microdissection followed by RNA-sequencing was used to compare intraductal to invasive lesions resulting from IGOs. To better understand the connection between KRAS signaling and the fast-progressing phenotype, RNA-sequencing was used to compare cultured organoids in which oncogenic KRAS (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3845"">GeneID: 3845</a>) was hyperactivated to control organoids, and to compare laser-capture microdissected lesions derived from IGOs of KRAS-hyperactivated organoids to lesions derived from control organoids. To ascertain copy number, low-coverage, whole genome DNA-sequencing was performed on organoids cultured in vitro, and on laser-capture microdissected lesions derived from IGO tumors.</p>","David A.

The strongest epidemiologic risk factor is family history of the disease. Familial studies have identified a number of genes contributing to increased risk. Of these, the highly penetrant BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes account for the majority of families in whom disease-causal mutations have been identified. However, mutations in other genes have been associated with predisposition to breast or breast and ovarian cancer including (CHEK2, ATM, PALB2, RAD51C, RAD51D). Together these genes account for less than 20% of excess familial breast cancer risk and do not explain ~50% of high-risk families referred for genetic testing. This significant gap in our understanding of the genetic basis of breast cancer poses a significant barrier to our ability to identify women at increased risk, who would benefit greatly from appropriate clinical management. To identify additional breast cancer predisposition genes whole exome sequencing of familial high-risk breast cancer patients was undertaken. DNA samples from 50 pairs of breast cancer patients from high-risk breast cancer families with no pathogenic mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 breast cancer predisposition genes were subjected to whole exome sequencing. The goal was to select candidate predisposition genes for further validation studies based on sharing of putative protein inactivating mutations among both members of each family and/or the frequency of inactivating mutations among the 50 families.</p>","Fergus J.

Here, we developed solutions to overcome this obstacle in the context of normal human skin, thus offering the first glimpse into the genomic landscapes of melanocytes at single-cell resolution. We comprehensively genotyped 133 melanocytes from 19 sites across 6 donors. As expected, sun-shielded melanocytes had fewer mutations than sun-exposed melanocytes. However, within sun-exposed sites, melanocytes on chronically sun-exposed skin (e.g. the face) displayed a lower mutation burden than melanocytes on intermittently sun-exposed skin (e.g. the back). Melanocytes from donors with a history of skin cancer had higher mutation burdens than melanocytes from donors without skin cancer, implying that the mutation burden of normal skin can be harnessed to measure cumulative sun damage and skin cancer risk. Moreover, melanocytes from healthy skin commonly harbor pathogenic mutations, likely explaining the origins of the melanomas that arise in the absence of a pre-existing nevus. Phylogenetic analyses identified groups of related melanocytes, suggesting that melanocytes spread throughout skin as fields of clonally related cells, invisible to the naked eye. Overall, our study offers an unprecedented view into the genomic landscapes of individual melanocytes, revealing key insights into the causes and origins of melanoma.</p>","A.

All studies were reviewed and approved by institutional ethics review committees at the involved institutions. </p> <p><b>CARET.</b> The Carotene and Retinol Efficacy Trial (CARET) was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of the cancer prevention efficacy and safety of a daily combination of 30 mg of beta-carotene and 25,000 IU of retinyl palmitate in 18,314 persons at high risk for lung cancer. CARET began in 1985, and the intervention was halted in January 1996, 21 months ahead of schedule, with the twin conclusions for definitive evidence of no benefit and substantial evidence of a harmful effect of the intervention on both lung cancer incidence and total mortality. CARET continued to follow and collect endpoints on their participants through 2005. Pathology reports and medical records were reviewed to confirm cancer endpoints, and death certificates obtained to capture cause of death. During the active intervention phase of CARET, serum, plasma, whole blood, and lung tissue specimens were collected on participants. These biospecimens make up the CARET Biorepository. For the OncoArray Project, CARET provided DNA extracted from whole blood of lung cancer cases and controls matched on age at baseline (&#43;/- 4 years), sex, race, baseline smoking status, history of occupational asbestos exposure (asbestos vs heavy smoker), and year of enrollment (2-year intervals). </p> <p><b>EPIC. </b>The European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study. The European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study is a multi-center cohort study involving 521,000 study participants from 10 European countries.ref The current study involved EPIC participants from 7 countries (Greece, Netherlands, UK, France, Germany, Spain, and Italy), including 1010 incident lung cancer cases and 1025 smoking matched controls. </p> <p><b>Nurses Health Study</b></p> <p>The NHS was initiated in 1976, when 121,700 United States registered nurses between the ages of 30 and 55 returned an initial questionnaire reporting medical histories and baseline health-related exposures. Every two years, follow-up questionnaires are mailed to the participants (questionnaire response rate &#62;90% for all follow-up cycles). Diet was assessed in 1986, 1990, 1994, and 1996 with a semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire. Between 1989 and 1990, blood samples and relevant sample collection information (blood draw features such as fasting status at blood collection) were collected from 32,826 women.</p> <p><b>National Physician Health Study</b></p> <p>The National Physicians Health Study The remaining 22,071 physicians were then randomly assigned to receive active aspirin and active beta-carotene (n&#61;5,517), active aspirin and beta-carotene placebo (n&#61;5,520), aspirin placebo and active beta-carotene (n&#61;5,519), or aspirin placebo and beta-carotene placebo (n&#61;5,515). A total of 11,037 physicians were randomized to aspirin and 11,034 to aspirin placebo; a total of 11,034 physicians were randomized to beta-carotene and 11,037 to beta-carotene placebo. </p> <p><b>The Multiethnic Cohort (MEC).</b> The MEC Study includes 215,251 men and women aged 45-74 years at recruitment, primarily from five ethnic/racial groups - African Americans and Latinos mostly recruited from CA (mainly from Los Angeles County) and Japanese Americans, Native Hawaiians and whites (mostly recruited from HI). The cohort was assembled in 1993-1996 by mailing a self-administered questionnaire to persons identified primarily through driver&#39;s license files. The baseline questionnaire obtained information on demographics, anthropometry, smoking history, medical and reproductive histories, family history of cancer, diet and physical activity. Incident cancer cases are identified by regular linkage with the State of California Cancer Registry and the Hawaii Tumor Registry, both members of the SEER Program of the NCI. In 2001-2006, a prospective biorepository was assembled by collecting a pre-diagnostic blood specimen from 67,594 surviving MEC members. At the time of blood collection a short questionnaire was administered that included information on smoking during the previous 15 days. For this study, cases were all lung cancer cases incident to blood draw and diagnosed before December 2012. For each case, a control was selected among unaffected MEC participants who were alive at time of the case&#39;s diagnosis and matched on study site, sex, race/ethnicity, age (age at diagnosis for cases; age at blood collection for controls), and date of blood collection.</p> <p><b>The Mount-Sinai Hospital-Princess Margaret Study (MSH-PMH). MSH-PMH</b> was conducted in the greater Toronto area from 2008 to 2013. Lung cancer cases were recruited at the hospitals in the network of the University of Toronto. Controls were selected randomly from individuals registered in the family medicine clinics databases and were frequency matched with cases on age and sex. All subjects were interviewed, and information on lifestyle risk factors, occupational history and medical and family history was collected using a standard questionnaire. Tumors were centrally reviewed by the reference pathologist (a member of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) committee) and a second pathologist in the University Health Network. If the reviews conflicted, a consensus was arrived at after discussion. Coding of histology was based on 2001 WHO/IASLC. Genomic DNA was extracted based on standard protocol.</p> <p><b>PLCO. </b>The PLCO study, a randomized trial aimed at evaluating the efficacy of screening in reducing cancer mortality, recruited approximately 155,000 men and women age 55 to 74 years from 1992 to 20014. Screening for lung cancer among participants in the intervention arm included a chest x-ray at baseline followed by either three annual x-rays (for current or former smokers at enrollment) or two annual x-rays (for never smokers); participants in the control arm received routine health care. Screening-arm participants provided data on sociodemographic factors, smoking behavior, anthropometric characteristics, medical history, and family history of cancer, as well as blood samples annually for the first 6 years of the study (baseline [T0] and T1 through T5). Lung cancers were ascertained through annual questionnaires mailed to the participants, and positive reports were followed up by abstracting medical records or death certificates. Follow-up in the trial as of July 2009 was 96.7%. Patients were excluded because of missing baseline questionnaire, previous history of any cancer, diagnosis of multiple cancers during follow-up, missing smoking information at baseline, missing consent for utilization of biologic specimens for etiologic studies, or unavailability/insufficient quantity of serum or DNA specimens.</p> <p><b>The Harvard Lung Cancer Study (HLCS). </b>HLCS is a case-control study based at Mass General Hospital (MGH) in Boston, Massachusetts from 1992 to 2004. Eligible cases included any person over the age of 18 years with a diagnosis of primary lung cancer that was further confirmed by an MGH lung pathologist. Controls were recruited from the friends or spouses of cancer patients or the friends or spouses of other surgery patients in the same hospital. Potential controls were excluded from participation if they had a diagnosis of any cancer (other than non-melanoma skin cancer). Interviewer-administered questionnaires, a modified version of the standardized American Thoracic Society respiratory questionnaire, collected information on demographics, medical history, family history of cancer, smoking history, and a detailed work history, including job titles and tasks. The Institutional Review Board of MGH and the Human Subjects Committee of the Harvard School of Public Health approved the study.</p> <p><b>Liverpool Lung Project. </b>The Roy Castle Lung Study of Liverpool Lung Project (LLP) is a case-control and cohort study which has recruited over 11,500 individuals since 1996 from the Liverpool region in the UK. Detailed epidemiological and clinical data is collected with associated specimens (i.e. tumour tissue, blood, plasma, sputum, bronchial lavage and oral brushings). The participants have completed a detailed lifestyle questionnaire at recruitment, with repeat questionnaires at intervals; updated data on clinical outcome and hospital events are collected through the Health and Social Care Information Centre (including Office of National Statistics mortality data, Cancer Registry and Health Episode Statistics). The project is registered on the UK National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) lung cancer portfolio and has all the required ethical approvals and sponsorship arrangements in place. The lung tumours were reviewed by the reference pathologist.</p> <p><b>The IARC Russian Cancer study. </b>Lung cancer cases and controls were recruited through a multicentric case-control study coordinated by the International Agency for Research on Cancer in Russia, from 2005 to 2013. Cases were incident cancer patients collected from general hospitals. Controls were recruited from individuals visiting general hospitals and out-patient clinics for disorders unrelated to lung cancer and/or its associated risk factors, or from the general population. Information on lifestyle risk factors, medical and family history was collected from subjects by interview using a standard questionnaire. All study participants provided written informed consent. The current study included 4882 lung cancer cases and 5313 controls genotyped on the Affymetrix Axiome Array.</p> <p>Summary: After quality control, the following samples are available for analysis.</p> <p> <style> table, th, td { border: 1px solid black; border-collapse: collapse; } th, td { padding: 5px; text-align: left; } </style> <table style=""width:100%""> <tr> <th rowspan=""9"">Study</th> <td>CARET (CART22)</td> <td>CARET Nested case-control</td> <td>USA</td> <td>524</td> <td>(34.8)</td> <td>978</td> <td>(65.2)</td> <td>1502</td> </tr> <tr> <td>EPIC-Lung (EPIC45)</td> <td>CARET Nested case-control</td> <td>Europe (Multi-site)</td> <td>481</td> <td>(51.3)</td> <td>456</td> <td>(48.7)</td> <td>937</td> </tr> <tr> <td>NHS/NPHS (HARV50)</td> <td>CARET Nested case-control</td> <td>USA</td> <td>475</td> <td>(50.7)</td> <td>462</td> <td>(49.3)</td> <td>937</td> </tr> <tr> <td>LCS (HSPH01)</td> <td>Hospital-based</td> <td>USA</td> <td>656</td> <td>(47.5)</td> <td>726</td> <td>(52.5)</td> <td>1382</td> </tr> <tr> <td>LLP (LLPC52)</td> <td>Hospital-based</td> <td>UK</td> <td>393</td> <td>(50.8)</td> <td>381</td> <td>(49.2)</td> <td>774</td> </tr> <tr> <td>MEC (MECO46)</td> <td>Nested case-control</td> <td>USA</td> <td>651</td> <td>(48.9)</td> <td>680</td> <td>(51.1)</td> <td>1331</td> </tr> <tr> <td>MSH-PMH (MCCT48)</td> <td>Clinic-based</td> <td>Canada</td> <td>1049</td> <td>(55.5)</td> <td>842</td> <td>(44.5)</td> <td>1891</td> </tr> <tr> <td>PLCO (PLCO53)</td> <td>Nested case-control</td> <td>USA</td> <td>175</td> <td>(33.3)</td> <td>351</td> <td>(66.7)</td> <td>526</td> </tr> <tr> <td>RUSS (RUSS54)</td> <td>Hospital-based</td> <td>Russia</td> <td>478</td> <td>(52.2)</td> <td>437</td> <td>(47.8)</td> <td>915</td> </tr> </table> </p> <p>Quality Control for Markers:<br/> <ul style=""list-style-type:circle""> <li>1) 414504 markers from TRICL CHIP (414603, excluding 99 markers with missing chromosome)</li> <li>2) 392574 markers excluding MNP, INDEL</li> <li>3) 382020 markers excluding duplicated SNPs (based on Affy&#39;s SNPs, one to one matched to dbSNPs, but some dbSNPs are missing)</li> <li>Call rate for 382020 SNP markers, 376571 among 382020 markers (0.9857363) have &#62;&#61; 95% call rate</li> <li>Median Concordance rate among 1801 duplicated markers is 0.998</li> </ul> Despite excellent concordance rate there were a large number of signals for association among markers with low allele frequency.

David Christiani at the Harvard University School of Public Health has been directing research studies to investigate etiological factors influencing lung cancer development since 1983 and has amassed a collection of 2000 controls and 5055 lung cancer cases. He has been actively collecting and storing snap frozen tumor samples since 1992. Around 1500 tumor samples have been collected and the average wet tumor yield is about 30 grams of tumor, of which 631 cases have completely annotated clinical and survival information. Pathology confirmation is provided by two pathologists. At the time of surgery, a minimum of 30 grams of wet lung tumor tissue and 30 grams of non-involved tissue from the same lobe is sectioned, flash frozen and sent to Dr. Christiani&#39;s lab for logging and storage. A blood sample for DNA and serum is collected. A structured interview by trained research staff is conducted on each case, and clinical outcomes and treatments is extracted and entered into the molecular epidemiology data base at Harvard. Fresh frozen samples have been collected from 1451 lung cancer and are available for study. Samples from this collaborative study have played key roles in major studies, including the initial finding describing EGFR mutations in lung cancer<sup>22</sup>. Participants in this study are patients, &#62; 18 years of age, with newly diagnosed histologically confirmed lung cancer.

After initial data control, the NCI-GWAS included 5,739 cases and 5,848 controls; however, an additional 26 cases and 112 controls were excluded due to changes in case status and further quality control filtering. The current meta-analysis included 5,713 lung cancer cases and 5,736 controls from the NCI-GWAS (Table 1).</p> <p><b>ICR-GWAS :</b> This comprised 1,952 cases (1,166 male; mean age at diagnosis 57 years, SD 6) with pathologically confirmed lung cancer ascertained through the Genetic Lung Cancer Predisposition Study (GELCAPS) conducted between March 1999 and July 2004<sup>16</sup>. All cases were British residents and self-reported to be of European Ancestry. To ensure that data and samples were collected from bona fide lung cancer cases and avoid issues of bias from survivorship only incident cases with histologically or cytologically (only if not AD) confirmed primary disease were ascertained. Tumours from patients were classified according to ICD-O-3; Specifically, SQ: 8070/3, 8071/3, 8072/3, 8074/3; AD: 8140/3, 8250/3, 8260/3, 8310/3, 8480/3, 8560/3, 8251/3, 8490/3, 8570/3, 8574/3; with tumours with overlapping histologies classified as mixed. Patient DNA was derived from EDTA-venous blood samples using conventional methodologies. Genotype frequencies were compared with publicly accessible data generated by the UK Wellcome Trust Case-Control Consortium 2 (WTCCC2) study<sup>17</sup> of individuals from the 1958 British Birth Cohort (58BC) and blood service typed using Illumina Human1.2M-Duo Custom_v1 Array BeadChips.</p> <p><b>MDACC-GWAS:</b> Cases and controls were ascertained from a case-control study at the U.T. M.D. Anderson Cancer Center conducted between 1997 and 2007<sup>1</sup>. Cases were newly diagnosed, patients with histologically-confirmed lung cancer presenting at M.D. Anderson Cancer and who had not previously received treatment other than surgery. Clinical and pathological data were abstracted from patient medical records and lung cancer histology was coded according to major histologocial groups. As per ICD-O-2 these groups were, SQ: 8070/3, AD: 8140/3, 8250/3, 8260/3, 8310/3, 8480/3, 8251/3 and 8490/3. Only patients with predominantly or wholly AD or SQ cancers were included; those with mixed histology or unspecified lung cancers, were excluded from the study. Controls were healthy individuals seen for routine care at Kelsey-Seybold Clinics, in the Houston Metropolitan area. Controls were frequency matched to cases according to smoking behaviour, age in 5-year categories, ethnicity, and sex. Former smoking controls were further frequency matched to former smoking cases according to the number of years since smoking cessation (in 5-year categories). After applying quality control data were available on 1,150 cases and 1,134 controls.</p> <p><b>HGF Germany:</b> The HGF GWA study was made up of three independent German studies as detailed below: In total 506 incident lung cancer cases (LUCY-study: n=305, Heidelberg lung cancer case-control study: n=201) were compared to 480 population controls (KORA surveys KORA). After excluding individuals with missing values and potentially related individuals 487 cases and 480 controls entered the data analysis for the TRICL meta-analysis project.</p> <p>LUCY (LUng Cancer in the Young) is a multicenter study with 31 recruiting hospitals in Germany <sup>18,19</sup>. The study is conducted by the Institute of Epidemiology, Helmholtz Zentrum Muenchen, and the Department of Genetic Epidemiology, Medical School, University of Gottingen). The LUCY-study provides access to a nationwide, population based family and a case-control sample (control population KORA, described below) of lung cancer patients aged 50 years or younger at diagnosis. Detailed epidemiologic data have been collected including data on medical history, education, family history of cancer and smoking exposure by phase assessment. Blood samples are taken and DNA and lymphoblastoid cell lines are prepared of all cases and controls and of parts of the relatives. Phenotype data of 847 young patients with primary lung cancer and 5524 relatives have been collected.</p> <p>Heidelberg lung cancer case-control study is an ongoing hospital based case-control study <sup>19,20</sup>. The German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) has recruited over 2000 lung cancer cases at and in collaboration with the Thoraxklinik Heidelberg, including 300 LC cases with onset of disease at the age of &#8804; 50. Approximately 750 hospital-based controls have also been recruited. Data on occupational exposure, tobacco smoking, educational status, and for a subgroup also on family history of lung cancer, assessed by a self-administered questionnaire is available. Blood samples have been taken, and DNA has been extracted.</p> <p>KORA (Cooperative health research in the Region of Augsburg) survey is a population-based KORA platform established by the Helmholtz Center Munich<sup>21</sup>. In total, four population based health surveys have been conducted during 1984/85-1999/2001. Overall 18000 participants in the age range between of 25 and 74 years at first interview were recruited. Detailed information on demographic characteristics, medical history, history of tobacco consumption and lifetime occupation together with biological materials were collected for more then 16000 probands.</p> <p><b>The Toronto Study:</b> The Toronto study was conducted in the Great Toronto Area between 1997 and 2002. Cases were recruited at the hospitals in the network of University of Toronto and Lunenfeld- Tanenbaum Research Institute. At the time of recruitment in the clinical setting, provisional diagnoses of lung carcinoma were first assigned based on clinical criteria. Diagnoses for all cases included were histologically confirmed by the reference pathologist who is a specialist in pulmonary pathology, based on review of pathology reports from surgery, biopsy or cytology samples in 100% of cases. Diagnostic classification was done initially according to ICD-9, ICD-10, and ICD for oncology-2, and subsequently converted to ICD-O-3. Tumors were grouped into the major categories included in this analysis according to primary cancer type based on the ICD-3 definitions. Controls were randomly selected from individual visiting family medicine clinics and Ministry of Finance Municipal Tax Tapes. All subjects were interviewed using a standard questionnaire and information on lifestyle risk factors, occupational history, medical and family history was collected. Blood samples were collected from more than 85% of the subjects. After applying the standardized quality control procedures and restricting to the study participants with European ancestry, 331 cases and 499 controls were included in the TRICL meta-analysis (7).</p> <p><b>Quality control of GWAS datasets:</b> Standard quality control was performed on all scans excluding individuals with low call rate (&#60;90%) and extremely high or low heterozygosity (i.e. P&#60;1.0 x 10<sup>-4</sup>), as well as all individuals evaluated to be of non-European ancestry (using the HapMap version 2 CEU, JPT/CHB and YRI populations as a reference; Supplementary Table 1).

phs001919,PAK4 Inhibition Improves PD-1 Blockade Immunotherapy,Melanoma,2020-03-13,,"Cancer of skin pigment cells; MM - malignant melanoma; Malignant Melanoma; Malignant Melanomas; Melanoma, Malignant; Melanomas","<p><u>Introduction with rationale and aims for study</u></p> <p>Immune checkpoint blockade therapies have significantly altered the current landscape of cancer treatment. However, this immunotherapy still fails more often than it succeeds. There are now evidences that the lack of tumour infiltration by immune cells is the main mechanism of primary resistance to PD&#8208;1 blockade therapies for cancer. It has been postulated that cancer cell&#8208;intrinsic mechanisms may actively exclude T cells from tumours, suggesting that the finding of actionable molecules that could be inhibited to increase T cell infiltration may synergize with checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy.</p> <p>With the idea of finding potential drivers of immune exclusion, we performed RNA sequencing analysis of biopsies from melanoma patients and compared the transcriptomic differences of samples that where infiltrated with those that did not have immune infiltration.</p> <p><u>Methods</u></p> <p>RNAseq analysis of gene expressions on biopsies from melanoma patients treated with checkpoint blockade were analysed. We focused on the variable of ""infiltration: yes or no,"", e.g. tumors that were well infiltrated by immune cells with those that kept immune cells out. Sequencing revealed a list of genes whose expression differed between the infiltrated and noninfiltrated tumors. The kinase PAK4 stood out as a good candidate for inhibition treatment in the future as it was consistently enriched in the samples without immune infiltration. To test whether immunotherapy would work better if we deleted PAK4, we first knocked out PAK4, using CRISPR&#8208;Cas9, in the &#8208;resistant melanoma cell line, B16. Then they injected the melanoma cells into mice and observed that PAK4 KO tumours now responded to PD&#8208;1 blockade. In order to elucidate whether pharmacological inhibition of PAK4 could recapitulate the results observed in the B16 PAK4 KO tumours, we obtained the PAK4 inhibitor, KPT-9274, from Karyopharm Therapeutics. Indeed, inhibiting PAK4 in combination with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 immunotherapy significantly slowed the growth of the B16 melanomas more than either drug alone.</p> <p><u>Results and Conclusions</u></p> <p>Transcriptomic analysis of melanoma tumors that were well infiltrated by immune cells with those that kept immune cells out revealed a list of genes whose expression differed between the infiltrated and non-infiltrated tumours. The result suggests that p21 activated kinase 4 (PAK4) is enriched in non-responding tumour biopsies with low T cell and dendritic cell infiltration. In addition, PAK4 decreased WNT activity, a signalling pathway that has previously been involved in immune exclusion. In mouse models, genetic deletion of PAK4 increased T cell infiltration and reversed resistance to PD&#8208;1 blockade in a CD8 T cell-dependent manner. Furthermore, combination of with the PAK4 inhibitor, KPT-9274, improved anti&#8208;tumour responses compared to anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 alone. Therefore, high PAK4 expression is correlated with low T cell and dendritic cell infiltration and lack of response to PD&#8208;1 blockade, which could be reversed with PAK4 inhibition. The data establish a rationale for targeting this kinase with inhibitors in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors for patients.</p> <p><u>Future work and data that we can anticipate for this study</u></p> <p>Oncogenic signalling pathways and specially the WNT signalling pathway, have been associated with lack of immune infiltration and resistance to PD&#8208;1 blockade therapies. Here, we show that PAK4 overcome resistance to PD&#8208;1 blockade while significantly decreases WNT signalling activity. Therefore, it constitutes the first potential druggable target that is able to reverse oncogenic driven immune cell exclusion. However, the fully mechanism whereby PAK4 sensitizes tumours to immunotherapy remains to be fully elucidated. It is necessary to address whether PAK4 inhibition overcomes resistance through WNT signalling inhibition or if other signalling pathways are involved in the observed phenotype.</p>","Antoni Ribas, MD PhD",25970248;25428505,P01 CA168585,Cohort,,PAK4,Immunotherapy,39.0,60.0,HMB-PUB-NPU-MDS,RNA-Seq,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs001919,nan,nan,a5fbe10a-fb11-4d72-9645-f58cff02df43,dbGaP

The data for these members were drawn from three KP cohort studies: Research Program in Genes, Environment and Health (RPGEH) ProHealth, and California Men's Health Study (CMHS) (described further under Study History). Four custom arrays were designed for genotyping, one for each of the four major race-ethnicity groups in the RPGEH cohort: African Americans, East Asians, Latinos, and Non-Hispanic Whites.

This study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the orally available protein kinase C inhibitor, AEB071, in patients with metastatic UM, and to perform genomic profiling of metastatic tumor samples, with the aim to propose combination therapies. Metastatic UM patients (n=153) were treated with AEB071 in a Phase I, single-arm study. Patients received total daily doses of AEB071 ranging from 450 to 1400 mg. First-cycle dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were observed in 13 patients (13%). These were most commonly gastrointestinal system toxicities and were dose related, occurring at doses &gt; 700 mg/day. Preliminary clinical activity was observed, with 3% of patients achieving a partial response and 50% with stable disease (median duration 15 weeks). High-depth, targeted next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS) was performed on 89 metastatic tumor biopsy samples. Mutations previously identified in UM were observed, including mutations in GNAQ, GNA11, BAP1, SF3B1, PLCB4, and amplification of chromosome arm 8q. GNAQ/GNA11 mutations were observed at a similar frequency (93%) as previously reported, confirming a therapeutic window for inhibition of the downstream effector PKC in metastatic UM. In conclusion, the protein kinase C inhibitor AEB071 was well tolerated and modest clinical activity was observed in metastatic UM. The genomic findings were consistent with previous reports in primary UM. Together, our data allow envisaging combination therapies of PKC inhibitors with other compounds in metastatic UM.</p>",Sophie Piperno-Neumann,,Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation,Clinical Trial,,ALK;APC;ATM;ATR;ATRX;BACH1;PRDM1;BRCA1;BRAF;BRCA2;RUNX1;RUNX1T1;CCND3;CD79B;CDH1;CDKN2A;CDKN2B;CDKN2C;CTNNB1;DAXX;DNMT3A;ERG;FANCE;FGFR3;GNA11;GNAQ;GRIN2A;HLA-A;IRF4;MRE11;MYC;NBN;NF1;NFKBIA;NOTCH4;NRAS;PIK3C2G;PPP2R1A;PRKAR1A;PRKDC;PTCH1;SMARCA4;TP53;WT1;KMT2D;BAP1;GNA13;SF3B1;LRP1B;PBRM1;PAK5;BCORL1;BRIP1;FAT3;RICTOR,Neoplasm Metastasis;Eye Neoplasms,89.0,89.0,DS-UM-GSO,WXS,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs001953,nan,nan,81cfa65e-dc53-4b97-b1b4-c66167527b03,dbGaP

Enrolled patients are mailed saliva and blood draw kits, which can be used to extract germline DNA and cell-free DNA (cfDNA), respectively. The study team contacts participants&#39; healthcare institutions to obtain medical records and a portion of archived tumor samples. All received tumor samples are subjected to centralized histological re-review by an expert pathologist to confirm a diagnosis of angiosarcoma. Whole exome sequencing is performed on tumor DNA, germline DNA, and cfDNA; transcriptome sequencing is performed on tumor RNA.

For example, the insertion of HPV DNA into human chromosomes is the single most important event leading to tumorigenesis in cervical cancer. It is also now preventable with vaccines against HPV. In contrast to viral DNA integrations, the instances and repercussions of bacterial DNA integration into the somatic human genome are less clear. Yet bacterial DNA integrations (BDI) found to be associated with tumorigenesis could also be prevented using therapeutics like vaccines that limit exposure to the bacteria. Previous analysis of publicly available sequencing data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) showed BDIs from Pseudomonas spp. rRNA into the 5&#39;-UTR of four proto-oncogenes as well as in Ig (the immunoglobulin gene) of gastric cancer samples. The original samples from TCGA were not available to validate these findings. Therefore, a different cohort of gastric cancer patients was identified in order to establish the presence BDIs. Whole exome sequencing was completed on seven tumor samples and six adjacent gastric samples, as well as one intestinal metaplasia sample and one non-atrophic gastritis sample.

Succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) deficiency causes a subset of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) with DNA hyper-methylation. Here we associate this hyper-methylation with changes in chromosome topology that activate oncogenic programs. To investigate epigenetic alterations in this disease, we systematically mapped DNA methylation, CTCF insulators, enhancers and chromosome topology in KIT-mutant, PDGFRA-mutant and SDH-deficient GISTs. Although these respective subtypes share similar enhancer landscapes, we identified hundreds of putative insulators where DNA methylation replaced CTCF binding in SDH-deficient GISTs. We focused on disrupted insulators that partitions super-enhancers from FGF3, FGF4 and the KIT oncogene. Recurrent loss of this insulator alters locus topology in SDH-deficient GISTs, allowing aberrant physical interaction between enhancers and oncogenes. CRISPR-mediated excision of the corresponding CTCF motif in an SDH-intact model disrupted the boundary and up-regulated FGFs and KIT expression. Our findings reveal how a metabolic lesion destabilizes chromatin structure to facilitate the initiation and selection of epigenetic alterations that drive oncogenic programs in the absence of canonical mutations.</p>","Bradley E.

In early disease stages, MF presents as skin patches and plaques that in some cases may progress to tumor and disperse to lymph nodes and other internal organs. The 10-year overall survival is 50% in advanced stages. Early diagnosis is difficult as the histology overlaps with features of inflammatory skin diseases. Even when the diagnosis is established, there are no prognostic markers that predict whether the disease will be aggressive or indolent. Lastly, there are no curative treatments and MF will invariably relapse, even after aggressive chemotherapy. The disease is a diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic challenge. The main objective of this study is to address the question of tumor heterogeneity in MF. To date, MF is considered to be monoclonal, derived from a transformed, mature memory T-cell. However, clinical observations and preliminary data suggest that MF comprises multiple subclones, which may be of importance for understanding disease evolution and resistance to therapy.

phs001433,Non-coding RNAs Activated in Hepatoblastoma,Hepatoblastoma,2019-11-27,,,"<p>Hepatoblastoma (HB) is the most common pediatric liver tumor, affecting mostly children under 3 years of age. This rare tumor represents 1% of all pediatric cancers. Genetic studies have shown that HB is characterized by high frequency mutations of the CTNNB1 gene encoding beta-catenin (around 75%) and relative genomic stability. Here we have analyzed the transcriptional profile of 21 HBs compared to matched non-tumor livers by Cap Analysis of Gene Expression (CAGE), which provides accurate and quantitative profiling of all transcripts. CAGE analysis revealed strong upregulation of known Wnt target coding genes in most tumors analyzed, consistent with previous transcriptomic studies. To better define the Wnt-dependent transcriptional landscape of HB, we integrated CAGE data with TCF4 ChIP-seq data from a CTNNB1-mutated cancer cell line and with the FANTOM5 genomic coordinates of TCF/LEF binding motifs. Both TCF/LEF binding motifs and ChIP-seq peaks were strongly enriched in the immediate upstream region, not only for protein-coding genes, but also for non-coding transcripts. Among the selected 112 top Wnt target genes at FDR&#60;1.0E-6 and fold change&#62;8, we found clear over-representation (66%) of distant transcription start sites (TSSs) representing lncRNAs and enhancer RNAs, which raises the question of their role in HB pathogenesis. Analysis of the 112 promoters using CAGEd-oPOSSUM confirmed the predominant involvement of Tcf/Lef transcription factors, together with HNF4G, GATA2, Sox3 and Ets-related genes. Finally, the 112 Wnt target signature defined 3 tumor subclasses, T1, T2 and T3, characterized by progressive alteration of the non-coding part of the transcriptome and significant differences in clinical behavior.</p>",Marie Annick Buendia;Piero Carninci;Jamila Faivre,26510915,Modhep (259743),Case-Control,http://www.modhep.eu/,,,21.0,42.0,HMB,RNA-Seq,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs001433,nan,nan,b73329d3-ae3e-4486-8810-535e0aba95ee,dbGaP

In addition, DNA/RNA sequencing revealed that common cancer pathways are not visibly altered in FL-HCC but identified two novel structural variants, both resulting in fusion transcripts. Through in vitro studies, we demonstrated the oncogenic properties of these fusion transcripts. These experiments further highlight the tumorigenic role of gene fusions in the etiology of pediatric solid tumors and identify both candidate biomarkers and possible therapeutic targets for this lethal pediatric disease.</p>","Julien Sage, PhD",25122662,CA114102;UL1 RR025744,Case Set,,,"Carcinoma, Hepatocellular",1.0,5.0,DS-PLC-GSO,Seq_DNA_SNP;RNA-Seq;WXS;WGS,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000828,nan,nan,617debf5-6553-42ec-b2ca-35243b02f9f2,dbGaP

Most subtypes of AML are difficult to treat, in part due to a lack of understanding of possible molecular targets. Furthermore, the peak incidence of AML is in the sixth decade, and patients over the age of 65 do not tolerate chemotherapeutic regimens well. Moreover, AML has been highly studied as a model for other cancers. An RNA Biology Program is established aiming to develop comprehensive datasets through the profiling of all different classes of RNA expression, RNA editing, alternative splicing, and non-coding RNAs in CD34&#43; normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSC), their differentiated progeny, and AML clinical samples that could be utilized to understand leukemia.</p> <p>These datasets will allow us to computationally identify and characterize various RNA species and processes to enable the development of effective therapeutics to AML, leukemia and other types of cancers. Epigenetic factors such as methylation and histone modifications will also be characterized from these clinical samples allowing for integrated dataset analysis to look at the cross-talk between RNA and DNA/epigenomics in leukemia.</p> <p>The following is a subsidiary study of the above study description where whole genome sequencing was performed on two collected AML patients&#39; samples using Illumina and Oxford Nanopore sequencing technologies.

NanoVar is an accurate and rapid SV characterization tool that utilizes low-depth Nanopore sequencing data. NanoVar makes use of split-reads and hard-clipped reads for SV discovery and employs a simulation-trained neural network classifier for true positive enrichment. NanoVar exhibited higher accuracy and faster computational speed amongst other long-read SV detection tools in simulated data. In AML patient data, NanoVar displayed excellent accuracy in SV characterization (16/16 SVs validated in two patients) by using only 4x depth sequencing data. In summary, NanoVar improves the accuracy and speed of SV characterization at a lower sequencing cost, an approach compatible with clinical studies.</p>",Melissa Jane Fullwood,,"Singapore Ministry of Education AcRF Tier 3 grant;  			National Research Foundation, the Singapore Ministry of Education under its Centres of Excellence initiative",Cohort,,,RNA;DNA,2.0,4.0,GRU,WGS,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs001847,nan,nan,99429cf5-82fc-482e-a405-bc820b405fcd,dbGaP

phs001436,Discovering the Genetic Basis of Human Neuroblastoma: A Gabriella Miller    Kids First Pediatric Research Program (Kids First) Project,Neuroblastoma,2019-09-25,,Not Provided,"<p>Children with disseminated neuroblastoma have a very high risk of treatment failure and death despite receiving intensified chemotherapy, radiation therapy and immunotherapy. The <i>long-term goal</i> of our research program is to ultimately improve neuroblastoma cure rates by first comprehensively defining the genetic basis of the disease. The <i>central hypothesis</i> to be tested here is that neuroblastoma arises largely due to the epistatic interaction of common and rare heritable DNA variation. Here we will perform a comprehensive whole genome sequencing of 563 quartets of neuroblastoma patient germline and diagnostic tumor DNAs and germline DNAs from both parents. The case series was recently collected through a Children's Oncology Group epidemiology clinical trial and is robustly annotated with complete demographic (age, sex, race, ethnicity), clinical (e.g. age at diagnosis, stage, risk group), epidemiologic (parental dietary and exposure questionnaire) and biological (e.g. tumor <i>MYCN</i> status and multiple other tumor genomic measures) co-variates. Subjects were consented for genetic research and DNA is immediately available for shipment for sequencing. We propose Illumina-based whole genome sequencing in the 593 ""trio"" germline samples (<b>Aim 1</b>; due to missing parent: 487 full neuroblastoma triads, 106 child-single parent dyads = 1673 whole genome sequences) and matched diagnostic tumor DNA (<b>Aim 2</b>; N=366) at 30x sequencing depth (N=2039 whole genome sequences). Also in Aim 2 we will perform whole exome (100x) and RNA sequencing on the 366 tumor DNA and 228 tumor RNA samples from this cohort. Finally, we propose a pilot study of structural variation using long-range sequencing in 10 non-overlapping tumor samples chosen based on potentially relevant chromosomal alterations discovered with conventional NGS. Thus, a total of 2277 individual samples and 2655 sequences will be generated. We will use our established analytic pipeline that is currently being used to study the germline genomes of all cases sequenced through the NCI supported Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments program. We plan a three-stage analytic approach, first focusing on classic <i>de novo</i> and inherited Mendelian damaging alterations. We will next integrate our extensive epigenomic data from human neuroblastoma cell lines and genome-wide association study data (N=5,703 neuroblastoma cases to date) to guide a comprehensive assessment of noncoding variants that influence tumor initiation with a recently established analytic pipeline. Finally, we will utilize the tumor DNA analyses to inform relevance via somatic gain or loss of function effects at the sequence and/or copy number levels. All data generated in this project will be immediately placed into the Genomic Data Commons (GDC) and we will compute within this environment by importing our analytic pipelines into the GDC. These data will be fully integrated into the Kids First Data Resource and freely shared with all academically qualified petitioners. This comprehensive data set derived from a large and richly phenotyped series of neuroblastoma DNA quartets will be integrated with existing germline and/or tumor genomic data from over 6,000 neuroblastoma subjects (but none with matched patient-parent germline sequencing data) to provide an unparalleled opportunity to comprehensively discover the genetic basis of neuroblastoma.<br></p>",John M.

We conducted two GWAS and combined each of these with convenience controls consisting of unaffected African American participants in cohorts with existing GWAS data. We then conducted a meta-analysis of the two sets. Cases were persons of African ancestry with smoldering or active multiple myeloma identified at participating oncology clinics or through SEER registries, as part of the African American Multiple Myeloma Study (AAMMS) diagnosed from Jan 1, 1988 through July 31, 2016. The majority of the samples were collected from incident and prevalent cases diagnosed since Jan 1, 2008 (80.9%), with a minority obtained from biobanks from cases diagnosed prior to 2008 (19.1%). Additional samples were obtained from the Multiethnic Cohort (USC and University of Hawaii) (n=40), the University of California at San Francisco Multiple Myeloma Study (n=27), and from the Multiple Myeloma Research Consortium for secondary analysis (samples originally provided to MMRC by 8 additional sites (n=84)). We have identified the phenotype (smoldering myeloma, plasma cell multiple myeloma, or myeloma not otherwise specified (myeloma NOS) when myeloma phenotype was not known), sex and age at diagnosis in this data set. The initial GWAS set consisted of 1308 (1,305 passed QC) cases with DNA samples, with a GWAS performed on the Illumina Human Core. Controls consisted of 7,078 unaffected African American subjects who were participants in the African American Prostate and Breast Consortium, with existing GWAS data from the Illumina1M Duo BeadChip.

Black women are diagnosed with breast cancer at a younger median age; have more clinically aggressive disease and stage-for-stage; and have higher mortality rates than age-matched Caucasian women. Black women in West Africa, the origin of the slave trade in the US in the 19th century and thus the founder population for most African Americans, have even higher rates of early-onset, poor-prognosis breast cancer than African American women. Racial difference in the distribution of intrinsic molecular subtypes has been well characterized in the US and throughout the African Diaspora as well. Despite the large efforts on characterizing racial/ethnic differences, however, the reasons women of African ancestry are disproportionately affected by breast cancer incidence and mortality remain poorly understood - largely due to paucity of data on inherent genomic differences that contribute to the disparities in incidence and progression of breast cancer across populations. </p> <p>West Africa Breast Cancer Study (WABCS) is an initiative that aims to comprehensively understand the genetic architecture of breast cancer in West Africans, the founder population of a large proportion of black women in the United States. The objective of the study was to provide a better understanding of the molecular genetic factors that influence prognosis in Nigerian breast cancer patients, and determine which of these alterations may be amenable to available therapy. To that end, we examined the molecular features of breast cancers of indigenous African women using a combination of whole-genome, whole-exome, and transcriptome sequencing (WGS, WES, and RNA-seq) on 194 tumors from Nigerian patients.</p> <p>The goal of this project was to obtain answers to two related research questions using an unscreened population without genetic admixture in Nigeria: 1) why are women of African ancestry more likely to develop aggressive young onset breast cancer? 2) What are the associated genomic and non-genomic risk factors? <i>We hypothesize that the genomic determinants of breast cancer molecular subtypes in women of African ancestry are also molecular drivers of tumor progression and represent targets for interventions to improve clinical outcomes and close the mortality gap.</i></p> <p>By identifying causal links between genetic variants that promote aggressive tumor progression in Nigerian women in comparison to women from different population found in TCGA and ICGC, the present dataset will have significant public health impact on millions of women in the African Diaspora.

Little is understood regarding factors that may predict drug toxicities. Pharmacogenetics, the investigation of variants in candidate genes in drug metabolism pathways, has been used to determine susceptibility to treatment-related toxicities, as well as to cancer recurrence. Although there have been some strong and important findings using this approach, such as identification of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that predispose to side effects associated with thiopurines and irinotecan, there has been less progress in assessment of genetic variants that predispose to toxicities resulting from the multi-drug regimen commonly used to treat breast cancer, anthracyclines (A), cyclophosphamide (C), and taxanes (T). These difficulties in identification of key gene variants may be due to the complex metabolic pathways of these drugs, the lack of rate limiting enzymes in the processes, or the limitations of single SNP analysis, rather than capturing all of the variability across the genes.</p> <p>In addition to drug metabolism pathways, however, there may be a number of constitutional factors or other processes that affect damage to normal tissues in the course of chemotherapy, some known or hypothesized, such as DNA repair and oxidative stress pathways, and others not yet discovered. However, there have been no clear candidate genes that account for a large part of the variation in drug or treatment response, and there are likely important genes that influence sensitivity of cells to chemotherapy through unknown pathways which have not yet been identified or hypothesized. The present technological capabilities to screen the entire genome for variants that discriminate populations allows the opportunity to identify these as yet unknown pathways, and open the doors to exciting new avenues of research into mechanisms that had not been previously considered.</p> <p>We conducted a genome-wide scan (GWAS) in a clinical trial (S0221), in which women with high risk breast cancer were treated with different dosing schedules of C, A and T. Blood specimens were collected and banked, and DNA extracted for genotyping on the Illumina OMNI 1M platform. The GWAS data were used to examine genetic variants significantly associated with grades 3 and 4 toxicities, including peripheral neuropathy recorded during the T segment. In S0221, toxicities were graded according to the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE). The neurotoxicity is predominantly a distal sensory neuropathy, which is characterized by pain, numbness, tingling, and reduced functional capacity in the extremities. Other symptoms include parasthesias, ataxia, impaired vibration and joint position sense, and loss of tendon reflexes. By using a GWAS approach, it is likely that important pathways not previously considered can be revealed as important in susceptibility to treatment-related toxicities, identifying those at greatest risk for alternate drugs or dose reduction, and opening new areas of research for prevention of taxanes-related neuropathy among patients receiving chemotherapy for breast cancer. </p>","Christine Ambrosone, PhD",,R01CA139426,Clinical Trial;Cohort,,,Breast Neoplasms,1847.0,1847.0,DS-BRCATOX-COL-MDS-GSO,Array_SNP,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs001428,nan,nan,09136ef0-a18c-4855-bc0c-cc91b38eda5d,dbGaP

We screened chemical libraries (&#126;200,000 compounds) for chemical toxins that killed subsets of NSCLC but not normal human lung epithelial cells (HBECs). We first screened a panel of 12 NSCLC lines that represented a variety of known oncogenotypes and identified chemicals with large Z scores and appropriate properties including re-supply, chemistry, and reproducible drug response phenotypes. This was then narrowed down to a list of 202 chemicals and 18 drugs with known targeting (henceforth called &#34;Precision Oncology Probe Set&#34;, or POPS). These, and a panel of 30 clinically available drugs, targeted therapies, and drug combinations, already in use or in trials for NSCLC treatment, were then tested on a panel of 96 NSCLC lines for their drug response phenotypes in 12-point dose response curves. This information was analyzed using scanning ranked KS (Kolmogorov-Smirnov) and elastic net biostatistics approaches to identify molecular biomarkers (mutations, mRNA expression, copy number variation, protein expression, and metabolomics) which could predict for sensitivity or resistance to a particular chemical toxin or treatment regimen. From this we have discovered that: our approach identifies already known molecular biomarker of drug sensitivities (e.g. EGFR mutations and EGFR TK inhibitors); many clinically available chemotherapy agents have molecular biomarkers predicting preclinical model drug responses; the POP set of chemical toxins provides novel drug response phenotype patterns in the large NSCLC panel different from those found with clinically available agents including a therapeutic window; many of the POP toxins only hit a small percentage (&#126;5%) of the NSCLC panel but the POP set as a whole provides &#34;coverage&#34; of the entire NSCLC panel; there are simple, one or 2 component molecular biomarkers (mutations, mRNA expression) that predict responses to the different chemical toxins in the NSCLC panel; and that the molecular biomarkers provide some information on the targets and pathways involved in response to the chemical toxins. Thus, we have identified a group of chemical toxins with selectivity for subsets of NSCLC and associated tumor molecular biomarkers to facilitate their development for precision medicine, and also, in some cases, information on the targets and pathways interdicted by these chemical compounds.

However, even in melanoma, despite the high response rate, most patients are refractory to therapy or acquire resistance in 10-12 months. To identify key immunological elements coupled with response or resistance to checkpoint immunotherapy, we performed an unbiased analysis on 16,291 CD45&#43; immune cells from 32 patients (48 samples) treated with checkpoint therapy (anti-PD1&#61;37; anti-PD1/CTLA4&#61;11), using single cell transcriptomics. Initial unsupervised clustering of all CD45&#43; cells identified 11 clusters. When examining the association of these clusters with clinical outcome, we found that two clusters (B-cells, p&#61;0.005; memory T-cells, p&#61;0.03) were significantly enriched in responder lesions while 4 clusters (monocytes/macrophages, p&#61;0.003; dendritic cells, p&#61;0.015; exhausted CD8&#43; T-cells, p&#61;0.005; and exhausted/cell-cycle lymphocytes, 1.3x10<sup>-5</sup>) are enriched in non-responder lesions. Next, by leveraging our unbiased single cell approach, we identified not only clusters but also specific markers associated with either responder lesions (PLAC8, LTB, LY9, SELL, TCF7, IGKC and CCR7) or non-responder ones (CCL3, CD38, HAVCR2, ENTPD1 and WARS), many of which were not previously reported to be associated with clinical outcome to checkpoint therapy. Due to the importance of CD8&#43; T-cells in controlling tumors, the significant association of T-cell states with clinical outcome, and their high abundance in melanoma tumors, we next focused our analysis on CD8&#43; T-cells and identified 2 main clusters CD8_G (with increased expression of genes linked to memory) and CD8_B (enriched for genes linked to cell dysfunction), that were significantly enriched in responder (CD8_G, p&#61;1.4x10<sup>-6</sup>) and non-responder (CD8_B, p&#61;0.005) lesions, respectively. Since cells with both states coexist in each of the responder and non-responder lesions, we decided to calculate the ratio between the number of cells in these 2 clusters and observed a significant separation between responders (CD8_G/CD8_B&#62;1) and non-responders (CD8_G/CD8_B&#60;1) when looking at all samples, baseline or post samples separately. Similar results were detected when looking at the expression of a single transcription factor, TCF7, in CD8 T-cells in an independent cohort (n&#61;43) using a simple immunofluorescence assay. Additionally, we validated the identity and function of some of the newly identified cell states as well as their epigenetic landscape, and found that cells expressing the inhibitory molecules CD39 and TIM3, on top of being enriched in non-responder lesions, are likely to play a crucial role in T-cell exhaustion in melanoma. Collectively, our study provides extensive unbiased data in human tumors for discovery of predictors and therapeutic targets to checkpoint immunotherapy.</p>","Nir Hacohen, PhD",27192570;27501248;26167163;28397821;26997480;26027431;28514453;24056875;25891173;29070816;27533016;17950003;20727791;29066514;27301722;28487385;26359337,NCI,Cohort,,TCF7,Melanoma;T-Lymphocytes,32.0,98.0,DS-CA-IRB-PUB;DS-MSC-MDS,RNA-Seq;ATAC-seq;WXS,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs001680,nan,nan,22958c40-3fd2-497a-ad79-0e2c5ab06317,dbGaP

Marazita of the University of Pittsburgh Center for Craniofacial and Dental Genetics, and including a collaboration with Dr. Lina Moreno Uribe and Dr. Andrew Lidral of the University of Iowa. All families were ascertained through the Clinica Noel where patients with OFCs receive care from the Antioquia University School of Dentistry in Medellin, Colombia (key on-site colleagues included Dr. Luz Consuelo Valencia-Ramirez and Dr. Mauricio Arcos-Burgos). Genetic studies have shown that this population is comprised of an admixture of immigrant male Caucasians (mainly Spaniards and Basques) and native Amerindian females. Every subject has had a genetic evaluation, including a pedigree analysis for a family history of clefting and other birth defects, a pregnancy history for environmental exposures, and a complete physical exam to rule out suspected or known syndromes or environmental phenocopies. Sequencing was done by the Broad Institute sequencing center funded by the Kids First program (grant number U24-HD090743). The case in each of the Kids First OFC trios has cleft lip (CL, Figure A below), cleft palate (CP, Figure B), or both (CL+CP, Figure C):<br></p> <img src=""GetImage.cgi?study_id=phs001420&amp;image_name=GMKFCleft.jpg""> <p>OFCs are genetically complex structural birth defects caused by genetic factors, environmental exposures, and their interactions. OFCs are the most common craniofacial anomalies in humans, affecting approximately 1 in 700 newborns, and are one of the most common structural birth defects worldwide. On average a child with an OFC initially faces feeding difficulties, undergoes 6 surgeries, spends 30 days in hospital, receives 5 years of orthodontic treatment, and participates in ongoing speech therapy, leading to an estimated total lifetime treatment cost of about $200,000. Further, individuals born with an OFC have higher infant mortality, higher mortality rates at all other stages of life, increased incidence of mental health problems, and higher risk for other disorders (notably including breast, brain, and colon cancers). Prior genome-wide linkage and association studies have now identified at least 18 genomic regions likely to contribute to the risk for nonsyndromic OFCs. Despite this substantial progress, the functional/pathogenic variants at OFC-associated regions are mostly still unknown. Because previous OFC genomic studies (genome-wide linkage, genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and targeted sequencing) are based on relatively sparse genotyping data, they cannot distinguish between causal variants and variants in linkage disequilibrium with unobserved causal variants. Moreover, it is unknown whether the association or linkage signals are due to single common variants, haplotypes of multiple common variants, clusters of multiple rare variants, or some combination. Finally, we cannot yet attribute specific genetic risk to individual cases and case families. <b><i>Therefore, the goal of the current study is identify specific OFC risk variants in Latin American families by performing whole genome sequencing of parent-case trios.</i></b></p>","Mary L.

To expand these efforts, we assembled case-control sets or nested case-control sets from 20 different North American or European studies. Summary descriptions and study participant inclusions/exclusion criteria for each of these studies are detailed below.</p> <p><b>The Black Women&#39;s Health Study (BWHS): </b><br/> Is the largest follow-up study of the health of African-American women (Cozier et al., 2004; Rosenberg et al., 1995) [PMID: 15018884; PMID: 7722208]. The purpose is to identify and evaluate causes and preventives of cancers and other serious illnesses in African-American women. Among the diseases being studied are breast cancer, colorectal cancer, type 2 diabetes, uterine fibroids, systemic lupus erythematosus, and cardiovascular disease. The study began in 1995, when 59,000 black women from all parts of the United States enrolled through postal questionnaires. The women provided demographic and health data on the 1995 baseline questionnaire, including information on weight, height, smoking, drinking, contraceptive use, use of other selected medications, illnesses, reproductive history, physical activity, diet, use of health care, and other factors. The participants are followed through biennial questionnaires to determine the occurrence of cancers and other illnesses and to update information on risk factors. Self-reports of cancer are confirmed through medical records and state cancer registry records. Mouthwash-swish samples, as a source of DNA, were obtained from &#126;26,000 BWHS participants in 2002-2007. DNA was isolated from the mouthwash-swish samples at the Boston University Molecular Core Genetics Laboratory using the QIAAMP DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen). All incident colorectal cancer cases with a DNA sample were included in the present analysis. Two controls per case, selected from among BWHS participants free of colorectal cancer at end of follow-up, were matched to cases on year of birth (&#43;/- 2 years) and geographical region of residence (Northeast, South, Midwest, and West). A total 209 colorectal cancer cases and 423 controls were sent for genotyping. </p> <p><b>Campaign Against Cancer and Heart Disease (CLUE II):</b><br/> The Campaign Against Cancer and Heart Disease, is a prospective cohort designed to identify biomarkers and other factors associated with risk of cancer, heart disease, and other conditions (Kakourou et al., 2015) [PMID: 26220152]. 32,894 participants were recruited from May through October 1989 from Washington County, Maryland and surrounding communities. Colorectal cancer cases (n &#61; 297) and matched controls (n &#61; 296) were identified between 1989 and 2000 among participants in the CLUE II cohort of Washington County, Maryland. </p> <p><b>Colorectal Cancer Study of Austria (CORSA):</b><br/> In the ongoing colorectal cancer study of Austria (CORSA), more than 13,000 Caucasian participants have been recruited within the province-wide screening project &#34;Burgenland Prevention Trial of Colorectal Disease with Immunological Testing&#34; (B-PREDICT) since 2003 (Hofer et al., 2011) [PMID: 21422235]. All inhabitants of the Austrian province Burgenland aged between 40 and 80 years are annually invited to participate in fecal immunochemical testing and haemoccult positive screening participants are invited for colonoscopy. CORSA includes genomic DNA and plasma of colorectal cancer cases, low-risk and high-risk adenomas, and colonoscopy-negative controls. Controls received a complete colonoscopy and were free of colorectal cancer or polyps. CORSA participants have been recruited in the four KRAGES hospitals in Burgenland, Austria, and additionally, at the Medical University of Vienna (Department of Surgery), the Viennese hospitals &#34;Rudolfstiftung&#34; and the &#34;Sozialmedizinisches Zentrum Sud&#34;, and at the Medical University of Graz (Department of Internal Medicine). 1403 colorectal cancer and advanced colorectal adenoma cases, and 1404 matched controls were selected for the study. Distribution of factors sex and age (5 year strata) were evenly matched between cases and controls. </p> <p><b>Cancer Prevention Study II (CPS II):</b><br/> The CPS II Nutrition cohort is a prospective study of cancer incidence and mortality in the United States, established in 1992 and described in detail elsewhere (Calle et al., 2002; Campbell et al., 2014) [PMID: 12015775; PMID: 25472679]. At enrollment, participants completed a mailed self-administered questionnaire including information on demographic, medical, diet, and lifestyle factors. Follow-up questionnaires to update exposure information and to ascertain newly diagnosed cancers were sent biennially starting in 1997. Reported cancers were verified through medical records, state cancer registry linkage, or death certificates. The Emory University Institutional Review Board approves all aspects of the CPS II Nutrition Cohort. A total of 360 cases and 359 controls were selected for this study. </p> <p><b>Czech Republic Colorectal Cancer Study (Czech Republic CCS):</b><br/> Cases with positive colonoscopy results for malignancy, confirmed by histology as colon or rectal carcinomas, were recruited between September 2003 and May 2012 in several oncological departments in the Czech Republic (Prague, Pilsen, Benesov, Brno, Liberec, Ples, Pribram, Usti and Labem, and Zlin). Two control groups, sampled at the same time of cases recruitment, were included in the study. The first group consisted of hospital-based individuals with a negative colonoscopy result for malignancy or idiopathic bowel diseases. The reasons for the colonoscopy were: i) positive fecal occult blood test, ii) hemorrhoids, iii) abdominal pain of unknown origin, and iv) macroscopic bleeding. The second control group consisted of healthy blood donor volunteers from a blood donor center in Prague. All individuals were subjected to standard examinations to verify the health status for blood donation and were cancer-free at the time of the sampling. Details of CRC cases and controls have been reported previously (Vymetalkova et al., 2014; Naccarati et al., 2016; Vymetalkova et al., 2016) [PMID: 24755277; PMID: 26735576; PMID: 27803053]. All subjects were informed and provided written consent to participate in the study. They approved the use of their biological samples for genetic analyses, according to the Declaration of Helsinki. The design of the study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Institute of Experimental Medicine, Prague, Czech Republic. All subjects included in the study were Caucasians and comprised 1792 cases and 1764 matched controls. Controls were matched to CRC cases as 1&#58;1 ratio. Matching was done on age and sex. Age was matched on &#43;&#45;5 years, whereas sex was matched exactly. For the cases without matched controls, matching was done only on sex. </p> <p><b>Early Detection Research Network (EDRN):</b><br/> The aim of the EDRN initiative is to develop and sustain a biorepository for support of translational research (Amin et al., 2010) [PMID: 21031013]. High-quality biospecimens were accrued and annotated with pertinent clinical, epidemiologic, molecular and genomic information. A user-friendly annotation tool and query tool was developed for this purpose. The various components of this annotation tool include: CDEs are developed from the College of American Pathologists (CAP) Cancer Checklists and North American Association of Central Cancer Registries (NAACR) standards. The CDEs provides semantic and syntactic interoperability of the data sets by describing them in the form of metadata or data descriptor. A total of 352 colorectal case samples and 399 controls were selected for this study. Controls were matched to CRC cases based on age and sex. </p> <p><b>The EPICOLON Consortium (EPICOLON):</b><br/> The EPICOLON Consortium comprises a prospective, multicentre and population-based epidemiology survey of the incidence and features of CRC in the Spanish population (Fernandez-Rozadilla et al., 2013) [PMID: 23350875]. Cases were selected as patients with de novo histologically confirmed diagnosis of colorectal adenocarcinoma. Patients with familial adenomatous polyposis, Lynch syndrome or inflammatory bowel disease-related CRC, and cases where patients or family refused to participate in the study were excluded. Hospital-based controls were recruited through the blood collection unit of each hospital, together with cases. All of the controls were confirmed to have no history of cancer or other neoplasm and no reported family history of CRC. Controls were randomly selected and matched with cases for hospital, sex and age (&#43;&#45; 5 years). A total of 370 cases and 370 controls were selected for genotyping. </p> <p><b>Hawaii Adenoma Study:</b><br/> For this adenoma study, two flexible-sigmoidoscopy screening clinics were first used to recruit participants on Oahu, Hawaii. Adenoma cases were identified either from the baseline examination at the Hawaii site of the Prostate Lung Colorectal and Ovarian cancer screening trial during 1996-2000 or at the Kaiser Permanente Hawaii&#39;s Gastroenterology Screening Clinic during 1995-2007. In addition, starting in 2002 and up to 2007, we also approached for recruitment all eligible patients who underwent a colonoscopy in the Kaiser Permanente Hawaii Gastroenterology Department. Cases were patients with histologically confirmed first-time adenoma(s) of the colorectum and were of Japanese, Caucasian or Hawaiian race&#47;ethnicity. Controls were selected among patients with a normal colorectum and were individually matched to the cases on age at exam, sex, race/ethnicity, screening date (&#43;&#45;3 months) and clinic and type of examination (colonoscopy or flexible sigmoidoscopy). We recruited 1016 adenoma cases (67.8% of all eligible) and 1355 controls (69.2% of all eligible); 889 cases and 1169 controls agreed to give a blood and 29 cases and 34 controls, a mouthwash sample. A total of 989 cases and 1185 controls were genotyped for this study. </p> <p><b>Columbus-area HNPCC Study (HNPCC, OSUMC):</b><br/> Patients with colorectal adenocarcinoma diagnosed at six participating hospitals were eligible for this study, regardless of age at diagnosis or family history of cancer. Patients with a clinical diagnosis of familial adenomatous polyposis were not eligible for this study. These six hospitals perform the vast majority of all operations for CRC in the Columbus metropolitan area (population 1.7 million). The institutional review board at all participating hospitals approved the research protocol and consent form in accordance with assurances filed with and approved by the United States Department of Health and Human Services. Briefly, during the period of January 1999 through August 2004, 1,566 eligible patients with CRC were accrued to the study (Hampel et al., 2008) [PMID 18809606]. A total of 1472 colorectal cancer samples had enough blood DNA remaining to be sent for genotyping. Control samples were provided by the Ohio State University Medical Center%#39;s (OSUMC) Human Genetics Sample Bank. The Columbus Area Controls Sample Bank is a collection of control samples for use in human genetics research that includes both donors&#39; anonymized biological specimens and linked phenotypic data. The data and samples are collected under the protocol &#34;Collection and Storage of Controls for Genetics Research Studies&#34;, which is approved by the Biomedical Sciences Institutional Review Board at OSUMC. Recruitment takes place in OSUMC primary care and internal medicine clinics. If individuals agree to participate, they provide written informed consent, complete a questionnaire that includes demographic, medical and family history information, and donate a blood sample. 4-7 ml of blood is drawn into each of 3 ACD Solution A tubes and is used for genomic DNA extraction and the establishment of an EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell culture, cell pellet in Trizol, and plasma. Controls were matched to CRC cases as 1&#58;1. Matching was done on age at reference time (age_ref), race, and sex. Age_ref was matched on &#43;&#45;5 years. Sex and race were matched exactly. For the cases without matched controls, matching was done only on sex and race with 1&#58;1 ratio. Since controls are fewer than cases, one control is matched on 2 cases at most. </p> <p><b>Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS):</b><br/> A parallel prospective study to the NHS (Nurses&#39; Health Study). The HPFS cohort comprised 51,529 men aged 40-75 who, in 1986, responded to a mailed questionnaire (Rimm et al., 1990) [PMID: 2090285]. Participants provided information on health related exposures, including current and past smoking history, age, weight, height, diet, physical activity, aspirin use, and family history of colorectal cancer. Colorectal cancer and other outcomes were reported by participants or next-of-kin and were followed up through review of the medical and pathology record by physicians. Overall, more than 97% of self-reported colorectal cancers were confirmed by medical record review. Information was abstracted on histology and primary location. Incident cases were defined as those occurring after the subject provided the blood sample. Prevalent cases were defined as those occurring after enrollment in the study but before the subject provided the blood sample. Follow-up evaluation has been excellent, with 94% of the men responding to date. Colorectal cancer cases were ascertained through January 1, 2008. In 1993-1995, 18,825 men in the HPFS mailed blood samples by overnight courier, which were aliquoted into buffy coat and stored in liquid nitrogen. In 2001-2004, 13,956 men in the HPFS who had not provided a blood sample previously mailed in a swish-and-spit sample of buccal cells. Incident cases were defined as those occurring after the subject provided a blood or buccal sample. Prevalent cases were defined as those occurring after enrollment in the study in 1986, but before the subject provided either a blood or buccal sample. After excluding participants with histories of cancer (except nonmelanoma skin cancer), ulcerative colitis, or familial polyposis, case-control sets were previously constructed. In addition to colorectal cancer cases and controls, a set of adenoma cases and matched controls with available DNA from buffy coat were selected for genotyping. Over the follow-up period, data were collected on endoscopic screening practices and, if individuals had been diagnosed with a polyp, the polyps were confirmed to be adenomatous by medical record review. Adenoma cases were ascertained through January 1, 2008. A separate case-control set was constructed of participants diagnosed with advanced adenoma matched to control participants who underwent a lower endoscopy in the same time period and did not have an adenoma. Advanced adenoma was defined as an adenoma 1 cm or larger in diameter and&#47;or with tubulovillous, villous, or highgrade dysplasia&#47;carcinoma-in-situ histology. Matching criteria included year of birth (within 1 year) and month&#47; year of blood sampling (within 6 months), the reason for their lower endoscopy (screening, family history, or symptoms), and the time period of any prior endoscopy (within 2 years). Controls matched to cases with a distal adenoma either had a negative sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy examination, and controls matched to cases with proximal adenoma all had a negative colonoscopy. In total, 159 advanced adenoma cases and 109 controls were selected for genotyping. </p> <p><b>Leeds Colorectal Cancer Study (LCCS):</b><br/> Following local ethical approval, colorectal cancer cases were recruited from 1997 until 2012 in Leeds, UK through surgical clinics. Initially, funding was provided by the UK Ministry of Agriculture, Farming and Fisheries (subsequently the Food Standards Agency) and Imperial Cancer Research Fund (subsequently Cancer Research UK). Recruitment also occurred similarly in Dundee, Perth and York between the periods of 1997 and 2001 using the same protocol and the data and samples were combined. Pathologically confirmed cases were consented at outpatient clinics, providing information on known and postulated risk factors for colorectal cancer (diet, lifestyle and family history) as well as providing a blood sample for DNA. Exclusion criteria included pre-existing diverticular disease and an inability to complete the questionnaire. The General Practitioners of cases (all UK residents have a nominated General Practitioner to whom to refer initial medical queries) and these GPs were asked to send letters to other persons on their patient list of the same gender and born within 5 years of the case. Subsequently to enhance the number of controls, we systematically invited patients from selected GP practices. Diet was assessed in cases and controls using an extensive dietary and lifestyle questionnaire modified by that produced by the European Prospective Investigation in Cancer (EPIC). The frequency that each specific food items were eaten was recorded and we also obtained average fruit and vegetable consumption as a cross-check. In total, 1591 cases and 739 controls provided a DNA sample. </p> <p><b>The North Carolina Colon Cancer Studies (NCCCS I/II):</b><br/> The North Carolina Colon Cancer Studies (NCCCS I- colon and NCCCS II-rectal) were population-based case-control studies conducted in 33 counties of North Carolina. Cases were identified using the rapid case ascertainment system of the North Carolina Central Cancer Registry. Patients with a first diagnosis of histologically confirmed invasive adenocarcinoma of the colon (cecum through sigmoid colon) between October 1996 and September 2000 were classified as potential cases in the NCCCS I. The NCCCS II included patients with a first diagnosis of histologically confirmed invasive adenocarcinoma of the sigmoid colon, rectosigmoid, or rectum (hereafter collectively referred to as rectal cancer) between May 2001 and September 2006. Additional eligibility requirements were: aged 40-80 years, residence in one of the 33 counties, ability to give informed consent and complete an interview, had a driver&#39;s license or identification card issued by the North Carolina Department of Motor Vehicles (if under the age of 65), and had no objections from the primary physician in regards to contacting the individual. Controls, identified and sampled during the respective study dates, were selected from two sources. Potential controls under the age of 65 were identified using the North Carolina Department of Motor Vehicles records. For those 65 years and older, records from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services were used. Controls were matched to cases using randomized recruitment strategies. Recruitment probabilities were done using strata of 5-year age, sex, and race groups. Dietary information was collected using a modified version of the semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire developed at the National Cancer Institute. In addition, participants were asked about vitamin and mineral supplementation, special diets, restaurant eating, sodium use, and fats used in cooking. In NCCCS I, 515 colorectal cases and 687 matched controls were sent for genotyping. In NCCCS II, 796 colorectal cases and 823 controls were sent from the NCCCS II for genotyping. Controls were matched to CRC cases as 1&#58;1 ratio. Matching was done on age, race, and sex. Age was matched on &#43;&#45;5 years. Race and sex was matched exactly. For the cases without matched controls, matching was done only on sex and race. </p> <p><b>Nurses Health Study (NHS):</b><br/> The NHS cohort began in 1976 when 121,700 married female registered nurses age 30-55 years returned the initial questionnaire that ascertained a variety of important health-related exposures (Belanger et al., 1978) [PMID: 248266]. Since 1976, follow-up questionnaires have been mailed every 2 years. Colorectal cancer and other outcomes were reported by participants or next-of-kin and followed up through review of the medical and pathology record by physicians. Overall, more than 97% of self-reported colorectal cancers were confirmed by medical-record review. Information was abstracted on histology and primary location. The rate of follow-up evaluation has been high: as a proportion of the total possible follow-up time, follow-up evaluation has been more than 92%. Colorectal cancer cases were ascertained through June 1, 2008. In 1989 -1990, 32,826 women in NHS I mailed blood samples by overnight courier, which were aliquoted into buffy coat and stored in liquid nitrogen. In 2001-2004, 29,684 women in NHS I who did not previously provide a blood sample mailed a swish-and-spit sample of buccal cells. Incident cases were defined as those occurring after the subject provided a blood or buccal sample. Prevalent cases were defined as those occurring after enrollment in the study in 1976 but before the subject provided either a blood or buccal sample. After excluding participants with histories of cancer (except nonmelanoma skin cancer), ulcerative colitis, or familial polyposis, case-control sets were previously constructed from which DNA was isolated from either buffy coat or buccal cells for genotyping. In addition to colorectal cancer cases and controls, a set of advanced adenoma cases and matched controls with available DNA from buffy coat were selected for genotyping. Over the follow-up period, data were collected on endoscopic screening practices and, if individuals had been diagnosed with a polyp, the polyps were confirmed to be adenomatous by medical record review. Adenoma cases were ascertained through June 1, 2011. A separate case-control set was constructed of participants diagnosed with advanced adenoma matched to control participants who underwent a lower endoscopy in the same time period and did not have an adenoma. Advanced adenoma was defined as an adenoma more than 1 cm in diameter and/or with tubulovillous, villous, or high-grade dysplasia/carcinoma-in-situ histology. Matching criteria included year of birth (within 1 year) and month/year of blood sampling (within 6 months), the reason for their lower endoscopy (screening, family history, or symptoms), and the time period of any prior endoscopy (within 2 years). Controls matched to cases with a distal adenoma either had a negative sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy examination, and controls matched to cases with proximal adenoma all had a negative colonoscopy. A total of 272 cases and 236 matched controls were sent to CIDR for the advanced adenoma case-control set. </p> <p><b>Northern Swedish Health and Disease Study (NSHDS):</b><br/> Comprises over 110,000 participants, including approximately one third with repeated sampling occasions, from three population-based cohorts (Dahlin et al., 2010; Myte et al., 2016) [PMID: 20197478; PMID: 27367522]. The largest is the ongoing Vasterbotten Intervention Programme, in which all residents of Vasterbotten County are invited to a health examination upon turning 30 (some years), 40, 50 and 60 years of age. Extensive measured and self-reported health and lifestyle data, as well as blood samples for central biobanking in Umea, Sweden, are collected at the health exam. Leucocyte DNA samples for 1&#58;1-matched CRC case-control sets from the NSHDS, of which 878 samples are included in this study, have been selected for genotyping. This is in addition to 354 samples from the NSHDS previously analyzed as part of the multicenter EPIC cohort. Cancer-specific and overall survival data are available for all patients. For at least 425 patients, archival tumor tissue has been analyzed for the BRAF V600E mutation and by sequencing codon 12 and 13 for KRAS mutations, as well as for MSI screening status by immunohistochemistry and for an eight-gene CIMP panel using quantitative real-time PCR (MethyLight). </p> <p><b>Ohio Colorectal Cancer Prevention Initiative (OCCPI, OSUMC):</b><br/> OCCPI (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01850654) is a population-based study of colorectal cancer patients diagnosed in one of 51 hospitals throughout the state of Ohio from January 1, 2013 through December 31, 2016. The OCCPI was created to decrease CRC incidence in Ohio by identifying patients with hereditary predisposition (statewide universal tumor screening for newly diagnosed CRC patients), increase colonoscopy compliance for first-degree relatives of CRC patients, and encourage future research through the creation of a biorepository. The 51 Ohio hospitals participating in the OCCPI were selected to represent a cross-section of clinical centers in the state based on high reported volume of CRC patients, affiliation with a high volume hospital, or interest in participation. Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval was obtained by the individual hospitals, Community Oncology Programs, or by ceding review to the OSU IRB. Written informed consent was obtained. A total of 2139 colorectal cases were genotyped. Patients were considered eligible for this study if they were age 18 or older at the time of enrollment, if they had a surgical resection (or biopsy if unresectable) in the state of Ohio demonstrating an adenocarcinoma of the colorectum from 1&#47;1&#47;13 - 12&#47;31&#47;16. Matched control samples were selected from the Ohio State University Medical Center&#39;s (OSUMC) Human Genetics Sample Bank in an identical way to the selection for the Columbus-area HNPCC Study (please refer to the description for the Columbus-area HNPCC Study). </p> <p><b>Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trail (PLCO):</b><br/> PLCO enrolled 154,934 participants (men and women, aged between 55 and 74 years) at ten centers into a large, randomized, two-arm trial to determine the effectiveness of screening to reduce cancer mortality. Sequential blood samples were collected from participants assigned to the screening arm. Participation was 93% at the baseline blood draw. In the observational (control) arm, buccal cells were collected via mail using the &#34;swish-and-spit&#34; protocol and participation rate was 65%. Details of this study have been previously described (Huang et al., 2016) [PMID&#58; 27673363] and are available online (http://dcp.cancer.gov/plco). For this study 1651 advanced adenoma cases and 1392 controls were selected for genotyping. </p> <p><b>Selenium and Vitamin E Prevention Trial (SELECT):</b><br/> The Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT) was a double-blind, placebo controlled clinical trial which explored using selenium and vitamin E alone and in combination to prevent prostate cancer in healthy men (Lippman et al., 2009) [PMID&#58; 19066370]. Secondary endpoints included the prevention of colorectal and lung cancers. SELECT was conducted at 427 sites and centers in the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico; 35,533 men 55 years and older (50 or older if African American) were randomized beginning August 22, 2001. Supplementation was discontinued on October 23, 2008 due to futility. 308 colorectal cancer cases and 308 matched controls were selected from the SELECT population and sent for genotyping. </p> <p><b>Screening Markers For Colorectal Disease Study and Colonoscopy and Health Study (SMS-REACH):</b><br/> Details on this study population were previously reported (Burnett-Hartman et al., 2014) [PMID&#58; 24875374]. Participants were enrollees in an integrated health-care delivery system in western Washington State (Group Health Cooperative, Seattle, Washington) aged 24-79 years who underwent an index colonoscopy for any indication between 1998 and 2007 and donated a buccal-cell or blood sample for genotyping analysis. Study recruitment took place in 2 phases, with phase 1 occurring in 1998-2003 and phase 2 occurring in 2004-2007. Persons who had undergone a colonoscopy less than 1 year prior to the index colonoscopy, persons with inadequate bowel preparation for the index colonoscopy, and persons with a prior or new diagnosis of colorectal cancer, a familial colorectal cancer syndrome (such as familial adenomatous polyposis), or another colorectal disease were ineligible. Patients diagnosed with adenomas or serrated polyps and persons who were polyp-free at the index colonoscopy (controls) were systematically recruited during both phases of recruitment. Approximately 75% agreed to participate and provided written informed consent. Based on medical records, persons who agreed to participate and those who refused study participation were similar with respect to age, sex, and colorectal polyp status. Study protocols were approved by the institutional review boards of the Group Health Cooperative and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (Seattle, Washington). A total of 575 cases and 508 matched were selected for the study. Controls were matched to CRC cases as 1&#58;1 ratio. Matching was done on age_ref, race, and sex. Age_ref was matched on &#43;&#45;5 years. </p> <p><b>The Women&#39;s Health Initiative (WHI):</b><br/> WHI is a long-term national health study that has focused on strategies for preventing heart disease, breast and colorectal cancer, and osteoporotic fractures in postmenopausal women. The original WHI study included 161,808 postmenopausal women enrolled between 1993 and 1998. The Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, WA serves as the WHI Clinical Coordinating Center for data collection, management, and analysis of the WHI. The WHI has two major parts&#58; a partial factorial randomized Clinical Trial (CT) and an Observational Study (OS); both were conducted at 40 Clinical Centers nationwide. The CT enrolled 68,132 postmenopausal women between the ages of 50-79 into trials testing three prevention strategies. If eligible, women could choose to enroll in one, two, or all three of the trial components. The components are: <b>Hormone Therapy Trials (HT):</b> This double-blind component examined the effects of combined hormones or estrogen alone on the prevention of coronary heart disease and osteoporotic fractures, and associated risk for breast cancer. Women participating in this component with an intact uterus were randomized to estrogen plus progestin (conjugated equine estrogens [CEE], 0.625 mg&#47;d plus medroxyprogesterone acetate [MPA] 2.5 mg&#47;d] or a matching placebo. Women with prior hysterectomy were randomized to CEE or placebo. Both trials were stopped early, in July 2002 and March 2004, respectively, based on adverse effects. All HT participants continued to be followed without intervention until close-out. <b>Dietary Modification Trial (DM):</b> The Dietary Modification component evaluated the effect of a low-fat and high fruit, vegetable and grain diet on the prevention of breast and colorectal cancers and coronary heart disease. Study participants were randomized to either their usual eating pattern or a low-fat dietary pattern. <b>Calcium/Vitamin D Trial (CaD):</b> This double-blind component began 1 to 2 years after a woman joined one or both of the other clinical trial components. It evaluated the effect of calcium and vitamin D supplementation on the prevention of osteoporotic fractures and colorectal cancer. Women in this component were randomized to calcium (1000 mg&#47;d) and vitamin D (400 IU&#47;d) supplements or a matching placebo. The <b>Observational Study (OS)</b>examines the relationship between lifestyle, environmental, medical and molecular risk factors and specific measures of health or disease outcomes. This component involves tracking the medical history and health habits of 93,676 women not participating in the CT. Recruitment for the observational study was completed in 1998 and participants were followed annually for 8 to 12 years. All centrally confirmed cases of invasive colorectal cancers, or deaths from colorectal cancer were selected as potential cases from September 30, 2015 database. Controls were participants free of colorectal cancer (invasive or in situ) as of September 30, 2015. Potential cases and controls were excluded if they (1) were non-White; (2) had history of colorectal cancers at baseline; (3) lost to follow-up after enrollment; (4) DbGAP ineligible; (5) had &#60;1.25ug of DNA; (6) selected for WHI study M26 Phase I or II; (7) selected for WHI study AS224 and also included in the imputation project. A total of 578 cases and 104,429 controls met the eligibility criteria. Each case was matched with 1 control (1&#58;1) that exactly met the following matching criteria: age (&#43;&#45;5 years), 40 randomization centers (exact), WHI date (&#43;&#45;3 years), CaD date (&#43;&#45;3 years), OS flag (exact), HRT assignments (exact), DM assignments (exact), and CaD assignments (exact). Control selection was done in a time-forward manner, selecting one control for each case from the risk set at the time of the case&#39;s event. The matching algorithm was allowed to select the closest match based on a criteria to minimize an overall distance measure (Bergstralh EJ, Kosanke JL. Computerized matching of cases to controls. Technical Report #56, Department of Health Sciences Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester MN. April 1995). Each matching factor was given the same weight. When exact matches could not be found, the matching criteria were gradually relaxed among unmatched cases and controls until all cases had found matched controls. Using the matching criteria specified above, 559 of the 578 eligible cases found exact matches. The matching criteria was then relaxed to &#58; Age&#43;&#45;5, randomization centers, WHI date &#43;&#45; 3 years, CaD date &#43;&#45; 3 years, OS flag, HRT flag, DM flag, CaD flag. 17 of the remaining 19 unmatched cases found matched controls. By matching on Age&#43;&#45;5, randomization centers, WHI date &#43;&#45; 3 years, CaD date &#43;&#45; 3 years, OS flag, HRT flag, the remaining 2 unmatched cases found their matches. </p>","Ulrike Peters, PhD",30510241,"X01 HG008596;U01 CA164930;HHSN268201200008I, NIH contract ""High throughput genotyping for studying the genetic contributions to human disease""",Case-Control;Cohort;Nested Case-Control,,,,29778.0,30487.0,DS-BOCA;NRUP;HMB;RCV-CRC-MDS;HMB-COL-GSO;CADM;GRU-GSO;HMB-IRB;DS-CEC-IRB;DS-CA-IRB;HMB-PUB-NPU-GSO;HMB-IRB-NPU;GRU;HMB-PUB,Imputation_SNP;Array_SNP,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs001415,nan,nan,746fa9fe-ef3f-4a5a-b760-6eb3e0d1f9e0,dbGaP

Like all melanomas, mucosal melanomas are frequently driven by activating mutations in the MAPK and/or PI3K pathways; however, unlike melanomas that arise on sun-exposed skin, mucosal melanomas harbor few point mutations. Instead, most somatic alterations involve structural alterations, which appear early during tumor progression. Molecular studies in mucosal melanoma generally only profile point mutations without interrogating copy number alterations, and pathogenic mutations are only found in 30% of cases.

This program focuses on gene discovery in pediatric cancers and structural birth defects and the development of the Gabriella Miller Kids First Pediatric Data Resource (Kids First Data Resource). Both childhood cancers and structural birth defects are critical and costly conditions associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Elucidating the underlying genetic etiology of these diseases has the potential to profoundly improve preventative measures, diagnostics, and therapeutic interventions.</p> <p>Whole Genome Sequence (WGS) and phenotypic data from this study are accessible through dbGaP and <a href=""https://kidsfirstdrc.org/"">kidsfirstdrc.org</a>, where other Kids First datasets can also be accessed. Disorders/Differences of Sex Development (DSD) are congenital conditions in which development of chromosomal, gonadal, or anatomic sex is atypical. DSD are chronic medical conditions collectively affecting &#126;1&#37; of the population, frequently requiring life-long care by multiple specialists, and carrying a significant public health burden. Some are associated with life-threatening events, such as adrenal crises in Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH). DSD are also associated with increased infertility, cancer, gender dysphoria risks, psychosocial distress and pervasive challenges to health-related quality of life (HRQoL) for patients and families. DSD are broadly classified into three categories: sex chromosome DSD, 46,XY DSD and 46,XX DSD, and further classified according to the type of gonad found in the patient (ovary, testis, ovotestis). </p> <p>We were able to increase significantly the diagnostic success for DSD using Whole Exome Sequencing (WES), with the identification of disease-causing and likely pathogenic variants in a third of a cohort of 46,XY patients. We have therefore proposed a shift in the diagnostic approach to DSD to use next-gen sequencing as a first-line clinical test, which could lead to faster and more accurate diagnosis, and orient further clinical management, limiting unnecessary, costly, and often invasive endocrine testing and imaging. However many remain unexplained (over half of the XY cases, a significant minority of XX cases, including most ovotesticular DSD, and most syndromic cases). In addition, the very large phenotypic variability in cases with known variants in the same gene is unexplained. </p> <p>We here propose to use Whole-Genome Sequencing (WGS), which dramatically improves upon exome sequencing, covering both coding and non-coding parts of the genome more uniformly, as an approach to not only improve diagnostic yield, but also to identify novel genes and regulatory elements involved in DSD.</p>","Eric VILAIN, MD, PhD",1717;25970709;20301589,X01HL132384,Parent-Offspring Trios,https://commonfund.nih.gov/kidsfirst/X01Projects#Vilain,NR0B1;AMH;AMHR2;AR;ATRX;BBS1;BBS2;BBS4;FOXL2;AKR1C4;CYP11A1;CYP17A1;CYP19A1;CYP21A2;AKR1C2;DHCR7;DMRT1;EMX2;FGF8;FGFR1;FGFR2;NR5A1;GATA4;GNRH1;GNRHR;HFE;HSD3B2;HSD17B3;ANOS1;LEP;LEPR;LHCGR;MAP3K1;PCSK1;POR;PROP1;SOX3;SOX9;SRD5A2;SRY;STAR;VAMP7;TAC3;TACR3;WT1;LHX3;MKKS;HESX1;MAMLD1;DMRT2;TRIM32;ZFPM2;BBS9;DHH;WWOX;WNT4;BBS7;CHD7;HHAT;PROK2;BBS10;ARL6;KISS1R;CBX2;TTC8;PROKR2;BBS5;BBS12;ARX;RSPO1,"Disorders of sex development;46, XY Disorders of Sex Development;Sex Chromosome Disorders of Sex Development;Ovotesticular Disorders of Sex Development;46, XX Testicular Disorders of Sex Development;Hypospadias;Cloaca;Gonadal Dysgenesis;Urogenital Abnormalities;Mullerian aplasia;Omphalocele exstrophy imperforate anus;Sexual Development",300.0,300.0,GRU,Seq_DNA_SNP_CNV;WGS,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs001178,nan,nan,4afc37b9-ddeb-4914-ad1f-62e3213a3387,dbGaP

While ALT occurs in only a subset of tumors, it is strongly associated with mutations in the genes encoding components of the histone H3.3 chaperone complex, ATRX and DAXX. To date the mechanistic role of ATRX and particularly DAXX mutations in potentiating ALT remains poorly understood. We identify an osteosarcoma cell line, G292, with a unique chromosomal translocation resulting in loss of DAXX function, while retaining functional ATRX. Using this distinctive resource, we demonstrate that introduction of wild type DAXX suppresses the ALT phenotype and restores localization of the ATRX/DAXX complex to PML bodies. This provides the first direct molecular evidence that ongoing DAXX deficiency is essential for maintenance of the ALT phenotype and highlights the potential for therapeutic targeting of this oncogenic pathway.</p>",Paul Metzer,,,Case Set,,ATRX;DAXX;KIFC3,,5.0,14.0,GRU,OTHER;RNA-Seq,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs001495,nan,nan,87df8017-6313-4acd-9d05-ce3792e5f7d7,dbGaP

To develop a precision medicine framework for mCRPC, we established a multi-institutional, international clinical sequencing infrastructure to enroll and carry out prospective whole exome and transcriptome sequencing of tumors from a cohort of mCRPC patients. We obtained high quality DNA and RNA sequence data from 150 bone or soft tissue biopsies. Central pathology revealed high-grade adenocarcinoma with only four cases (3.6%) showing neuroendocrine differentiation. Aberrations of AR, ETS genes, TP53 and PTEN were frequent (40-60% of cases), with TP53 and AR alterations being the most enriched in mCRPC compared to primary prostate cancer. We identified novel genomic alterations in PIK3CA/B (fusions and mutations); R-spondin, BRAF and RAF1 (fusions); APC (inactivating mutations); delta-catenin (missense mutations); and ZBTB16/PLZF (homozygous deletions). Aberrations of BRCA2, BRCA1 and ATM were observed at substantially higher frequencies (19.3% overall) than seen in primary prostate cancers, with 56% of these being exclusively somatic. Putative driver gene alterations were identified in nearly all patients, and over half also harbored driver gene fusions, homozygous deletions and/or amplifications. Moreover, 89% of patients harbored a clinically actionable aberration including 62.7% with aberrations in AR, 65% in other cancer-related genes, and 8% with actionable pathogenic germline alterations. Overall, integrative clinical sequencing analysis can be safely and efficiently performed in mCRPC, yields findings that may be actionable for enrolling patients in clinical trials of targeted therapies, and may inform the basis of individual clinical responses.</p>",Arul Chinnaiyan,,Stand up to Cancer,Case Set;Longitudinal,http://www.standup2cancer.org/,,,274.0,763.0,HMB-PUB-NPU;DS-PC-MDS;GRU;DS-CA-MDS,RNA-Seq;WXS;Seq_DNA_SNP_MAF_Ind,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000915,nan,nan,34d3d83b-03b7-4907-81b4-8ffb25256bed,dbGaP

Currently, GWA studies of CRC in NH-Whites, Japanese and African-Americans are ongoing. We propose a complementary study to address this critical research area in Hispanics. Hispanics represent the fastest growing ethnic population in the U.S. and have been largely understudied in terms of genetic susceptibility to cancer. There are noted differences in incidence, survival and mortality in CRC by ethnic/racial groups. Hispanics often present with CRC at a younger age and have a significantly greater incidence of stage IV tumors or metastatic disease compared to NH-Whites. We propose to conduct a large, cost-efficient, population-based GWAS in Hispanics by building upon existing NIH-funded resources, the Colon Cancer Family Registry (Colon CFR) and the Multiethnic Cohort Study (MEC). We plan to recruit 2,500 Hispanic men and women diagnosed with CRC between 01/2008 to present using cancer registries in California, physican referrals and familial referrals. Risk factor/diet questionnaires, pathology reports, Oragene saliva samples (for genotyping), optional blood samples (for genotyping and biometric analysis) and tumor blocks (for MSI testing) will be collected using methodologies developed in the Colon CFR/MEC. Cases of CRC in the MEC (currently 473; anticipated 600 at end) will also be included. Population-based Hispanic individuals without a diagnosis of CRC participating in other GWA studies in the MEC (n=3,900, U01HG004726, Haiman) will be used as controls. We will genotype all 3,100 cases using the Illumina 1M array and use available genotype and epidemiologic data collected on 3,900 controls. Our statistical analyses will include: single-SNP and haplotype effects, gene-environment interactions and heterogeneity by MSI, tumor subtype and family history of CRC. We will replicate findings in a second-stage using CRC cases and controls from Mexico (1,000 cases and 1,000 controls, EU FP7 funding, CHIBCHA, Carvajal-Carmona/Tomlinson). We will also examine heterogeneity of the risk estimates by ethnicity/race by leveraging GWA data on NH-Whites (2,142 cases, 1,909 controls, U01 CA122839, Casey), (4,000 cases, 6,000 NH-White controls, UK-CHIBCHA, Tomlinson), Colombians (2,000 cases and 2,000 controls, CHIBCHA), Japanese (1,000 cases and 1,000 controls) and African-Americans (1,500 cases and 1,500 controls, R01CA126895, Le Marchand). We will genotype replicated significant SNPs in our main and combined analysis in several Hispanic populations (note: studies funded by EU or NIH for data collection but not GWAS), including 800 Puerto Ricans, 2,000 Brazilians, 2,000 Argentineans and 3,000 Spanish/Portuguese, to assess generalizability of findings. We will examine the differences in inflammatory gene transcription dynamics in leukocytes (from blood sample collection) by fatigue level (as assessed from study questionnaire data). This study will have a high impact by addressing the key question of racial/ethnic disparities related to genetic susceptibility to CRC, will provide translational guidelines on biological mechanisms during the cancer survivorship period to increase quality of life among cancer survivors, and will enable further growth and investment into research among Hispanics by providing a resource of genetic data and biospecimens, which is lacking.</p>","Jane Figueiredo, PhD",27207650,R01 CA155101-01,GWAS,,,,1597.0,1597.0,DS-CA;GRU;HMB-MDS,Array_SNP,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs001193,nan,nan,4c3b7937-0e43-4274-8162-f018b75bdd65,dbGaP

The esophagus is exposed to both intrinsic and extrinsic mutagens resulting from gastric reflux, chronic inflammation and exposure to environmental carcinogens such as those found in cigarettes. Here we test the hypothesis that NSAID use inhibits accumulation of point mutations/indels during somatic genomic evolution in BE. <b>Methods:</b> Whole exome sequences were generated from 82 purified epithelial biopsies and paired blood samples from a cross-sectional study of 41 NSAID users and 41 nonusers matched by sex, age, smoking, and continuous time using or not using NSAIDs. <b>Results:</b> NSAID use reduced overall frequency of point mutations across the spectrum of mutation types, lowered the frequency of mutations even when adjusted for both <i>TP53</i> mutation and smoking status, and decreased the prevalence of clones with high variant allele frequency. Never smokers who consistently used NSAIDs had fewer point mutations in signature 17, which is commonly found in EA.

In order to more accurately identify subclones, define phylogenetic relationships, and probe genotype-phenotype relationships, we developed methods for targeted mutation detection in DNA and RNA isolated from thousands of single cells from five CLL samples. By clearly resolving phylogenic relationships, we uncovered mutated LCP1 and WNK1 as novel CLL drivers, supported by functional evidence demonstrating their impact on CLL pathways. Integrative analysis of somatic mutations with transcriptional states prompts the idea that convergent evolution generates phenotypically similar cells in distinct genetic branches, thus creating a cohesive expression profile in each CLL sample despite the presence of genetic heterogeneity.

Examples of CCDDs include congenital fibrosis of the extraocular muscles (CFEOM), congenital ptosis, Duane retraction syndrome (DRS), horizontal gaze palsy with progressive scoliosis (HGPPS), congenital 3rd, 4th or 6th nerve palsies, Moebius syndrome (MBS), and hereditary congenital facial paresis (HCFP). In some cases, anosmia, and disorders of hearing, sucking, chewing, swallowing, and breathing may also be classified as CCDDs. CCDDs can be accompanied by additional birth defects such as intellectual and social disabilities, developmental delays, limb anomalies, and cardiac, GI, and GU disorders. The genetic basis of multiple CCDDs has been determined, and the gene mutations typically alter cranial motor neuron identity or function, or perturb axon growth and guidance. Despite these successes, the genetic etiologies of many inherited CCDDs remain unidentified.<br></p>","Elizabeth Engle, MD",,X01: 1X01HL132377-01,Cohort;Parent-Offspring Trios,https://commonfund.nih.gov/kidsfirst/overview,,Oculomotor Nerve Diseases;Facial Nerve Diseases;Abducens Nerve Diseases;Trochlear Nerve Diseases,899.0,899.0,DS-CCDD-RD;DS-ELMD;DS-EMD,Seq_DNA_SNP_CNV;WGS,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs001247,nan,nan,688ef16e-be4d-428c-8ca2-54a73b83b927,dbGaP

GSK1120212 is not yet approved by the FDA for use in breast cancer patients. The investigators gave GSK1120212 for a short period of time (one week) to examine MEK and the other kinase expression in cancer cells both before and after the study drug is given. The investigators gave this drug for research purposes only. The length of time it was given is not intended to treat cancer.</p> <p>Recently researchers at UNC developed a process that can comprehensively profile the majority of the individual kinases in the kinome and examine the impact on kinase expression of kinase inhibitors (Duncan et al, Cell 2012, PMID: 22500798). This can tell us which kinases need to be concurrently blocked to augment responsiveness and prevent acquired resistance so that the investigators can design the best combinations of kinase blocking drugs for triple negative breast cancer. This is especially important for individuals with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) because there are no targeted drugs available that can block molecules that affect tumor growth. The investigators believe that kinase-blocking drugs have the potential to be a more effective treatment for people with TNBC.</p> <p>In this recently published study (Zawistowski et al, Cancer Discovery 2017, PMID: 28108460), TNBC patients treated with trametinib for 7 days resulted in a transcriptional response characterized by significant reprogramming of the tyrosine kinome, and this adaptive bypass response in human tumors was found to be similar to that seen in preclinical models including TNBC cell lines and mouse xenografts. In this study we also examined whether reprogramming differed between TNBC molecular subtypes, finding that basal-like and claudin-low human TNBC cells and mouse tumor subtypes had different adaptive transcriptional responses to MEK-ERK inhibition. Mechanistically we found that genome-wide enhancer remodeling drove the adaptive transcriptional response, suggesting that epigenetic approaches to reprogramming may be more durable than kinase inhibitor polypharmacology.</p>","Lisa A.

We analysed 60 patients with advanced DM treated with programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) or PD-1 ligand (PD-L1) blocking antibody therapy. Objective tumor responses were observed in 42 of the 60 patients (70%, 95% confidence interval 57-81%), including 19 patients (32% overall) with a complete response. Whole-exome sequencing revealed a high mutational load and frequent NF-1 mutations (14 out of 17 cases). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis from 19 DM and 13 non-DM revealed a higher percentage of PD-L1 positive cells in the tumor parenchyma in DM (p = 0.04), highly associated with increased CD8 density and PD-L1 expression in the tumor invasive margin. Therefore, patients with advanced DM derive significant clinical benefit from PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint blockade therapy despite being a cancer defined by its dense desmoplastic fibrous stroma. The benefit is likely derived from the high mutational burden and a frequent pre-existing adaptive immune response limited by PD-L1 expression.</p>","Antoni Ribas, MD, PhD",29320474,R35 CA197633;P01 CA168585;5P50CA168536;GM08042,Cohort,,,Melanoma,17.0,34.0,HMB-PUB-NPU-MDS,WXS;Seq_DNA_SNP_MAF_Ind,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs001469,nan,nan,426d8f5b-8e28-4145-969f-7b1d6f754b38,dbGaP

However, most NGS studies used DNA isolated either from whole blood or fresh frozen tissue specimens. Meanwhile, the tissue specimens available from most National Cancer Institute (NCI) funded cohorts and the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) registries (<a href=""http://seer.cancer.gov/biospecimen"">http://seer.cancer.gov/biospecimen</a>) are primarily formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE). There are limited data, on a small number of FFPE tissue samples, which suggest NGS is feasible. Much less is known about the feasibility of these technologies for large scale studies or using older FFPE specimens (e.g. 5-30 years old).</p> <p>The SEER cancer registries cover approximately 28% of the United States population, providing high quality demographic, clinical, pathologic, and survival data. The SEER Residual Tissue Repository (RTR) program was established in 2003. The RTR maintains biospecimens obtained from three of SEER&#39; population-based cancer registries: Iowa, Hawaii, and Los Angeles. Investigators at government, academic, and nonprofit institutions may apply to the program to obtain annotated FFPE tumor tissue specimens to study biomarkers, etiology, and other aspects with a population-based sample of cancer cases. </p> <p>The main objective of this project was to conduct a pilot study to determine whether the DNA obtained from archival FFPE tissue from 3 SEER Registries is of sufficient quality and quantity to conduct NGS. For Exome sequencing, sixty high-grade serous ovarian adenocarcinomas from FFPE tissues which were between 7 and 31 years old were obtained from three SEER registries. DNA was extracted, quantified, quality assessed, and subjected to whole exome sequencing. DNA extraction (yields and quality) and whole exome sequencing (depths of coverage and exome coverage obtained) results from this study will be presented. For RNA-sequencing, sixty-seven high-grade serous ovarian adenocarcinomas from FFPE tissues which were between 7 and 31 years old were obtained from three SEER registries. Total RNA was extracted, quantified, quality assessed, and subjected to whole transcriptome sequencing. Ultimately data derived from this analysis could serve as the basis for determining the utility of archival FFPE biospecimens for characterization and discovery projects utilizing NGS technologies instead of relying on frozen biospecimens. </p>","Wendy Cozen, DO, MPH;Brenda Hernandez, PhD, MPH;Charles F.

A virtually pathognomonic finding of NF1 is the plexiform neurofibroma (PN), a benign, likely congenital tumor that arises from biallelic inactivation of <i>NF1</i>. PN can undergo transformation to a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, an aggressive soft-tissue sarcoma. To better understand the non-<i>NF1</i> genetic contributions to PN pathogenesis, we performed whole-exome sequencing and genome-wide copy-number determination for 23 low-passage Schwann cell cultures established from surgical PN material with matching germline DNA. All resected tumors were derived from routine debulking surgeries. None of the tumors were considered at risk for malignant transformation at the time, <i>e.g.</i>, there was no pain or rapid growth. Deep (~500X) <i>NF1</i> exon sequencing was also conducted on tumor DNA. Non-<i>NF1</i> somatic mutation verification was performed using the Ampliseq/IonTorrent platform. We identified 100% of the germline <i>NF1</i> mutations and found somatic <i>NF1</i> inactivation in 74% of the PN. One individual with three PNs had different <i>NF1</i> somatic mutations in each tumor. The median number of somatic mutations per sample, including <i>NF1</i>, was one (range 0 - 8). <i>NF1</i> was the only gene that was recurrently somatically inactivated in multiple tumors. We found no recurrent non-<i>NF1</i> locus copy-number variation in PN. This is the first multi-sample whole-exome sequencing study of <i>NF1</i>-associated PN. Taken together with concurrent copy-number data, our comprehensive genetic analysis reveals the primacy of <i>NF1</i> loss as the driver of PN tumorigenesis.</p>","Douglas Stewart, MD",28068329,"National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA",Case-Control,,NF1,,21.0,44.0,GRU,WXS;Array_SNP,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs001403,nan,nan,d08b9037-8350-4986-95af-0726995db3e8,dbGaP

The incidence of EA has increased 6-fold in the U.S. since the 1970s, parallel to a significant increase in the prevalence of gastroesophageal reflux diseases (GERD). Although specific host factors might predispose one to disease risk, such a rapid increase in incidence must be predominantly environmental. The cause remains unknown.

To conduct a comprehensive population survey of the foregut microbiome and demonstrate its association with GERD sequence, by a 16S rRNA gene survey. We will analyze samples of the foregut microbiome at three anatomic loci: mouth, distal esophagus, and gastric corpus. Changes of the microbiota in the distal esophagus will be correlated with the phenotypes. Spatial relationship between the esophageal microbiota and upstream (mouth) and downstream (stomach) foregut microbiotas as well as temporal stability of the microbiome-disease association will also be examined.</p> <p>Specific Aim 2. To define distal esophageal metagenome and demonstrate its association with GERD sequence, by shotgun metagenomic analysis. We will first classify samples of the metagenome into metagenotypes by between-sample k-mer distance and correlate the metagenotypes with the four phenotypes. Subsequent detailed analyses will include pathway-disease and gene-disease associations. DNA viruses and fungi, if identified, also will be correlated with the phenotypes.</p> <p>A significant association between the foregut microbiome composition and GERD sequence, if demonstrated, will be the first step for eventually testing the causal hypothesis that an abnormal microbiome is required for the development of the sequence of phenotypic changes toward EA. If EA and its precursors represent a microbial ecological disease, treating the cause of GERD might become possible, for example, by normalizing the microbiome through use of antibiotics, probiotics, or prebiotics. Causative therapy for GERD could prevent its progression and reverse the current trend of increasing incidence of EA.</p>","Zhiheng Pei, MD, PhD;Karen Nelson, PhD",15657344;17142109;15545159;9827707;16221805;17106919;11352068;16112578;16497592;17183312;11123195;11959090;16437628;15016918;19394334,"National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA",Case-Control,http://gerd.med.nyu.edu/,,Adenocarcinoma Of Esophagus;Barrett's Esophagus;GERD,110.0,575.0,HMP,AMPLICON;WGS,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000260,nan,nan,64433002-767e-45d6-9565-d7d396a9c7eb,dbGaP

To study the impact of palindromic gene amplification in cancer genomes, we developed an approach to enrich DNA palindromes from genomic DNA (Genome-wide Analysis of Palindrome Formation, GAPF-seq). This dbGaP site lists the files of GAPF-seq of tumor DNA and plasma DNA from cancer patients. This site also lists other genomic data, such as shallow whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data. WGS data were used to examine the association of DNA palindromes, detected by GAPF-seq, and genomic amplification, detected by WGS.</p><p> </p> <p>In the initial study, we show that the ERBB2 oncogene at 17q12 is susceptible to palindromic gene amplification in HER2-positive breast tumors. We investigated eight tumors in this study, of which five tumors were HER2-positive, and three tumors were HER2-negative. HER2 status was determined by clinical FISH tests. We applied three genomic approaches to investigate the amplification mechanism: (1) copy number analysis by array-CGH on the Affymetrix SNP6.0 platform (8 files), (2) sequencing of DNA libraries enriched with tumor-derived palindromic DNA (Genome-wide Analysis of Palindrome Formation, GAPF-seq) (8 files) and (3) unbiased whole-genome sequencing (WGS) (1 file).

All patients consented to allow their cancer specimens to be used by researchers in an anonymized fashion. The consent form indicates that publication will take place without identifiers to protect the identity of any specific individual.</p> <p>We observed significant enrichment of palindromic DNA within amplified ERBB2 genomic segments in four out of five HER2-positive tumors. None of the three HER2-negative tumors showed such enrichment. Palindromic DNA was particularly enriched at amplification peaks and boundaries between amplified and normal copy-number regions. Thus, palindromic gene amplification shaped the amplified ERBB2 locus. The moderate enrichment of palindromic DNA throughout the amplified segments leads us to propose that the ERBB2 locus is amplified through a mechanism that repeatedly generates palindromic DNA, such as Breakage-Fusion-Bridge cycles.

These so-called read cloud approaches represent a powerful, accurate, and cost-effective alternative to single-molecule long-read sequencing. We developed software, GROC-SVs, that takes advantage of read clouds for structural variant detection and assembly. We apply the method to two 10x Genomics data sets, one chromothriptic sarcoma with several spatially separated samples, and one breast cancer cell line, all Illumina-sequenced to high coverage. Comparison to short-fragment data from the same samples, and validation by mate-pair data from a subset of the sarcoma samples, demonstrate substantial improvement in specificity of breakpoint detection compared to short-fragment sequencing, at comparable sensitivity, and vice versa. The embedded long-range information also facilitates sequence assembly of a large fraction of the breakpoints; importantly, consecutive breakpoints that are closer than the average length of the input DNA molecules can be assembled together and their order and arrangement reconstructed, with some events exhibiting remarkable complexity. These features facilitated an analysis of the structural evolution of the sarcoma. In the chromothripsis, rearrangements occurred before copy number amplifications, and using the phylogenetic tree built from point mutation data, we show that single nucleotide variants and structural variants are not correlated.

A total of 4,600 prostate cancer cases and 2,840 controls of European ancestry from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial were genotyped using the Illumina HumanOmni2.5 and passed rigorous quality control filters. Additional genotype data (available in dbGap under other accession numbers) from 101 independent controls of European ancestry scanned with the HumanOmni2.5 were also included, resulting in a total of 4,600 cases and 2,941 controls for the published analysis. SNPs from the most promising regions, as determined by rank p-value, under multiple different models as well as select candidate genes were taken forward for replication using a custom Iselect chip in 6,575 cases and 6,392 controls of European ancestry.

A germline mutation in BRCA1 (BRCA1+) is the most penetrant genetic predisposition for breast cancer. Nevertheless, a portion of BRCA1+ carriers does not develop breast cancer in their lifetime, suggesting that the genetic predisposition can be antagonized by resistant factors. BRCA1+ was inherited from an ancestor of the carrier family thousand years ago. We hypothesize that evolution could select certain genetic components to suppress oncogenesis caused by the predisposition. We compared germline variants in all genes in 27 pairs of breast cancer-unaffected and -affected BRCA1+ carriers, each pair inherited the same BRCA1+. We identified 12 deleterious variants enriched in breast cancer-unaffected carriers, all are common variants. A variant rs3735400 is located in ANLN, a cytokinesis-essential gene. Overexpression of variant-containing ANLN and suppressed expression of endogenous ANLN decrease ANLN nuclear localization and delay cell growth.

However, persistent AR signaling undermines therapeutic efficacy and promotes progression to lethal castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), even when patients are treated with potent second-generation AR-targeted therapies abiraterone and enzalutamide. Here we define diverse AR genomic structural rearrangements (AR-GSRs) as a class of molecular alterations occurring in one third of CRPC-stage tumors. AR-GSRs occur in the context of copy-neutral and amplified AR and display heterogeneity in breakpoint location, rearrangement class, and sub-clonal enrichment in tumors within and between patients. Despite this heterogeneity, one common outcome in tumors with high sub-clonal enrichment of AR-GSRs is outlier expression of diverse AR variant species lacking the ligand binding domain and possessing ligand-independent transcriptional activity. Collectively, these findings reveal AR-GSRs as important drivers of persistent AR signaling in CRPC.</p>","Scott M.

Genetic data submitted to dbGaP come from participants in the Carolina Breast Cancer Study, Women&#39;s Circle of Health Study, and Black Women&#39;s Health Study. The P01 consists of four scientific projects; the aims include follow-up on previous GWAS findings for breast cancer susceptibility in AA women as well as investigation of SNPs in candidate genes in biologically plausible pathways. These SNPs were genotyped using DNA from 3130 African-American women with breast cancer and 3700 controls. Descriptions of the original studies that provided the data and samples for this collaborative study are given below.</p> <p> <ol> <li><u>The Carolina Breast Cancer Study (CBCS):</u> a North Carolina population-based case-control study of breast cancer, conducted in three phases. The current study phase, phase 3 (years 2008-2014), includes women residents in 44 counties. CBCS phases 1 and 2 were conducted in 24 counties. Breast cancer cases are identified using Rapid Case Ascertainment in cooperation with the NC Central Cancer Registry. Controls were identified for phases 1 and 2 only (1993-1996 and 1996-2001), using Division of Motor Vehicles lists for women under age 65 and Health Care Financing Administration lists for women 65 and older. Randomized recruitment was used to oversample AA women and women under age 50. In-depth interviews are conducted by study nurses in participants&#39; homes to obtain information on potential risk factors for breast cancer. DNA samples have been obtained from most participants. Overall response rates for Phases 1 and 2 were 74% for AA cases and 54% for AA controls. Phase 3, conducted in 44 counties from 2008-2014, includes cases only. The response rate for AA cases in Phase 3 was 70.5%.</li> <li><u>The Women&#39;s Circle of Health Study (WCHS):</u> a multi-site case-control study in New York City (NYC) and New Jersey (NJ) aimed at evaluating risk factors for early and aggressive breast cancer in women of AA and EA ancestry. Recruitment in NYC took place between January 2002 and December 2008 and involved hospital-based ascertainment of cases, while controls were identified through random digit dialing (RDD). Recruitment at the NJ site started in March 2006 and is ongoing. Phase I of the study ended in April 2012 and covered seven counties in NJ. WCHS2 includes two additional counties. Cases in NJ were identified from 2006 to 2012 by the NJ State Cancer Registry using rapid case ascertainment. Controls were initially recruited though RDD (2006 to 2010) and later through community-based efforts (2009-2012). In-person interviews ascertained data on established and suspected risk factors for breast cancer. DNA samples were obtained. Among eligible AA women, 75% in NY and 54% in NJ completed an interview and provided a biologic specimen.</li> <li><u>Black Women&#39;s Health Study (BWHS):</u> an ongoing prospective cohort study of health and illness among U.S. black women, with a focus on cancer. The study began in 1995 when 59,000 AA women 21-69 years of age from across the United States completed a 14-page postal health questionnaire. The median age at entry was 38, and participants were residents of 17 states in mainland U.S.: Northeast, 28%; South, 30%; Midwest, 23%; West, 19%. The baseline questionnaire elicited information on a wide range of variables, including demographic factors, use of medical care, family history of breast cancer, reproductive and medical history, cigarette and alcohol use, weight, height, waist and hip circumference, medication use, diet, and exercise. Biennial follow-up questionnaires ascertain new cases of breast cancer and other illnesses and update covariate information. Medical record and cancer registry data are sought for all participants who report a diagnosis of breast cancer. As of 2014, approximately 80% of the baseline cohort have completed follow-up. DNA samples were obtained from about 50% of participants. BWHS data for the AMBER consortium were prepared as a nested case-control study, with controls frequency-matched to cases on year of birth, geographic region, and most recent questionnaire completed prior to the end of the at-risk period. </li> </ol> </p>",Julie R.

There is a need to molecularly stratify subpopulations of CRC to better predict outcome and assign therapies. Here we report targeted exome sequencing of 1,321 cancer-related genes on 468 tumor specimens, which identified a subset of 17 genes that best classify CRC, with APC (Gene ID: 324) playing a central role in predicting overall survival. APC may assume 0, 1, or 2 truncating mutations, each with a striking differential impact on survival. Tumors lacking any APC mutation carry a worse prognosis than single APC mutation tumors, but tumors with two APC mutations and KRAS (Gene ID: 3845) and TP53 (Gene ID: 7157) mutations confer the poorest survival among all the subgroups examined.

However, the extent of natural antisense transcription, the molecular mechanisms by which natural antisense transcripts (NATs) might affect their cognate sense genes, and the role of NATs in cancer are less well understood. Here, we use strand-specific paired-end RNA sequencing (ssRNASeq) on a cohort of 376 cancer patients covering 9 tissue types to comprehensively characterize the landscape of antisense expression. Our results reveal that greater than 60% of annotated transcripts have measureable antisense expression and the expression of sense and antisense transcript pairs is in general positively correlated. Furthermore, by studying the expression of sense/antisense pairs across tissues we identify lineage-specific, ubiquitous and cancer-specific antisense loci. Our results raise the possibility that NATs participate in the regulation of well-known tumor suppressors and oncogenes. Finally, this study provides a catalogue of cancer related genes with significant antisense transcription (oncoNAT). This resource will allow researchers to investigate the molecular mechanisms of sense/antisense regulation and further advance our understanding of their role in cancer.</p>",Arul M.

We performed WGS on members of two cohorts of cancer genetics patients: those with BRCA1/2 mutations (n = 176) and those without (n = 82). Initial analysis of potentially pathogenic variants (PPVs, defined as nonsynonymous variants with allele frequency &#60; 1% in ESP6500) in 163 clinically-relevant genes suggested that WGS will provide useful clinical results. This is despite the fact that a majority of PPVs were novel missense variants likely to be classified as variants of unknown significance (VUS). Furthermore, previously reported pathogenic missense variants did not always associate with their predicted diseases in our patients. This suggests that the clinical use of WGS will require large-scale efforts to consolidate WGS and patient data to improve accuracy of interpretation of rare variants. While loss-of-function (LoF) variants represented only a small fraction of PPVs, WGS identified additional cancer risk LoF PPVs in patients with known BRCA1/2 mutations and led to cancer risk diagnoses in 21% of non-BRCA cancer genetics patients after expanding our analysis to 3209 ClinVar genes. These data illustrate how WGS can be used to improve our ability to discover patients&#39; cancer genetic risks.

The sample includes unrelated cases and controls of European American and African American descent. Cases are defined by a commonly used definition of nicotine dependence, a current score of 4 or more (maximum score of 10) on the Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND). Control status is defined as an individual who smoked at least 100 cigarettes during their lifetime, yet never became dependent (lifetime FTND&#60;2). By selecting controls who smoked cigarettes, we focus on those genetic effects that are specific to the development of nicotine dependence.</p> <p><b><u>COGEND:</u></b> COGEND was initiated in 2001 as a three-part program project grant funded through the National Cancer Institute (NCI; PI: Laura Bierut). The three projects included a study of the familial transmission of nicotine dependence, a genetic study of nicotine dependence, and a study of the relationship of nicotine dependence with nicotine metabolism. The primary goal was to detect, localize, and characterize genes that predispose or protect an individual with respect to heavy tobacco consumption, nicotine dependence, and related phenotypes and to integrate these findings with the family transmission and nicotine metabolism findings. The primary design was a community based case-control study. Nicotine dependent cases and non-dependent, smoking controls were identified and recruited from Detroit and St. Louis. More than 54,000 subjects aged 25-44 years were screened by telephone; more than 3,100 subjects were personally interviewed; and more than 2,900 subjects donated blood samples for genetic studies. </p> <p><b><u>AAND:</u></b> AAND was initiated in 2009 to identify and characterize genetic determinants of nicotine dependence in a large African American population. Community-based recruitment of approximately 100,000 people was conducted to ascertain 1,000 African American nicotine dependent cases and 1,000 African American non-dependent, smoking controls. All subjects were between the ages of 25-44. Subjects were screened by telephone; if they qualified as a case or control, they completed the same interview that was used in COGEND and donated a blood sample.</p> <p>Both studies (COGEND and AAND) included measures of basic socio-demographic variables, including age, sex, race/ethnicity, family income, and educational attainment using the Semi-Structured Assessment for the Genetics of Nicotine Dependence. Information on nicotine dependence, as assessed by the Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND) is available for all subjects. In addition, participants also completed the Nicotine Dependence Syndrome Scale (NDSS; Shiffman et al., 2004) and the Wisconsin Inventory of Smoking Dependence Motives (WISDM-68; Piper et al, 2004).

We explored the associations of these factors with metrics of community composition and specific taxon abundances. We found that men and women had significantly different microbial community composition and that women had reduced abundance of a major phylum. Adiposity was associated with gut microbiome composition and specifically in women but not in men. Fiber from fruits and vegetables and fiber from beans were each associated with increased abundance of specific bacterial taxa.

The XPC-\- genetic background predicates a loss of global genome nucleotide excision repair (GG-NER), thus our data shows that regional differences in mutation frequency are a result of differential access of DNA repair protein. Unexpectedly, we also note that greater transcription reduces mutations on both strands of genes in heterochromatin, and only to those levels observed in euchromatin, in a XPC-dependent fashion. Therefore, transcription likely reduces mutation prevalence by increasing access to DNA repair proteins.

phs000634,NCI GWAS of Lung Cancer in Never Smokers,Lung Neoplasms,2015-06-29,,Lung Tumor; Lung cancer; Lung neoplasm; Lung tumour; Neoplasm of Lung; Neoplasm of the Lung,"<p><b>A genomewide study of lung cancer in never smokers</b></p> <p><b>Abstract and specific aims</b></p> <p>In the United States, lung cancer incidence and mortality rates have been steadily declining over the past decade, following decline in the prevalence of tobacco smoking. However, lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer death, killing more patients than breast, colon, and prostate cancers combined.</p> <p>Although tobacco smoke is the predominant risk factor for development of lung cancer, some patients develop the disease without a history of tobacco smoking. About 10 - 15% of all lung cancers occur in lilfetime never smokers. This figure will increase as the proportion of never smokers increases in the population. Even at present rates, lung cancer in never smokers, if considered a separate disease, is 6th to 8th top cause of cancer death.</p> <p>The growing number of never smokers in the USA and other countries emphasizes the importance of understanding the epidemiology and biology underlying lung cancer in this group.</p> <p>Genetic polymorphisms associated with the risk of lung cancer in never smokers are expected to overlap with those associated with the risk of lung cancer in ever smokers only partially. Epidemiological, molecular and clinical data suggest that molecular mechanisms of LC may differ in smokers and non-smokers, implying that lung cancer in never smokers is a different disease compared to the lung cancer in smokers. One can expect that there should be stronger genetic component in the control lung cancer in never smokers because effects of the genetic factors in never smokers are unmasked by the lack of tobacco smoke exposure.</p> <p>The genetic epidemiology of lung cancer in never smokers has not been well explored, largely because of difficulties in accruing the needed sample size for association studies. We propose a multicenter (total 14 sites from the US and Europe) genomewide association study of lung cancer in never smokers with the following specific aims:</p> <p><b>Aim 1: To identify candidate SNPs influencing risk for lung cancer in never smokers using Discovery sample.</b></p> <p>In the Discovery phase we will genotype 1256 Caucasian cases and 1365 age- and gender-matched never smoker controls using the Illumina Human660W-Quad platform. In addition, we will include in the analysis 284 cases and 175 matched controls already genotyped on the 610Quad platform. In this phase we will only include the study sites that have collected blood specimens (MDACC, Mayo Clinic, Karmanos Cancer Institute, The University of Liverpool Cancer research Centre, Institute of Cancer Research in Sutton, and Lunenfeld Research Institute in Toronto, Canada). All the samples will be sent to the independent lab for genotyping, to reduce site-specific technical artifacts. The final sample will consist of 1540 cases and 1540 controls matched by study site.</p> <p><b>Aim 2: To perform the second phase (validation) analysis of significant SNPs identified in aim 1 using an independent set of cases and controls.</b></p> <p>SNPs associated with risk at the significance level of 0.01 or below in the discovery set will be included in the replication phase. The proposed threshold guarantees an adequate power to retain SNPs with the typical effect size of 1.3. We plan to carry 6000-7000 SNPs for validation. The independent replication set will include 800 cases and 800 controls, mostly from sites that collected tissue (Mayo Clinic, Karmanos Cancer Institute, UT Southwestern) or buccal specimens (UCLA), but also blood samples (Imperial College London, University of Pennsylvana, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, National Research Center for Environment and Health, Neuherberg, Carmel Medical Center, Haifa). We will then perform a joint analysis to test the significance of the SNPs identified in the first stage using a stringent critical p-value of 10-7. There will be 2340 cases and 2340 controls in the joint set. Based on our experience with GWAS in smokers and assuming that genetic component in lung cancer risk in never smokers can be higher than genetic component in smokers, we expect to identify about 5-10 candidate regions associated with lung cancer risk in never smokers.</p> <p><b>Aim 3: To identify and explore pathways associated with the risk of lung cancer in never smokers.</b></p> <p>Results of the number of studies on the molecular mechanisms and drug response suggest that lung cancer in never smokers is a different disease and different pathways will be associated with lung cancer risk in non-smokers and smokers. To identify pathways and molecular functions associated with lung cancer risk in never smokers we will apply Ingenuity and DAVID bioinformatics tools. We will use at least 300 top candidate genes identified in joint and discovery analysis. The reason why we select rather large number of candidate genes for functional annotation is two-fold: 1. Both algorithms are looking for enrichment of pathways and function by most significant genes and they produce statistically robust results only when number of genes is relatively high. 2. Despite the fact that this study will be largest possible for never smokers we still are underpowered to detect SNPs with relatively small effect size. But though those SNPs will not reach genome wide level of significance they will tend to be on the top of the list. In other words genes from the gray zone (significant on individual level and non-significant for genome wide level) are expected to be enriched by true discoveries. True discoveries are likely to be associated with limited number of pathways / functions while false positives are expected to be uniformly distributed across functions and pathways. Therefore significant clustering of the gene to a given function will suggest that that those genes are true discoveries.</p> <p>This is the first GWAS aiming at identifying the genetic control of susceptibility to lung cancer in Caucasian never smokers. We will combine the available resources from the multiple sites to achieve the sample size sufficient for this study. The study will identify genetic architecture of the predisposition to the lung cancer in never smokers.</p>","Olga Gorlova, PhD",,R01 CA149462,Case-Control,,,,2320.0,2320.0,DS-CA;GRU-MDS,Array_SNP,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000634,nan,nan,7895f9e1-c655-4b6a-b657-b68a7dd2c4fb,dbGaP

The Consortium's work expanded in 2007 to include genome-wide association studies of estrogen receptor negative (ER-) breast cancer and aggressive prostate cancer. ER- breast cancers have specific epidemiologic characteristics and greater lethality, suggesting ER- breast cancer has a different etiology than ER+ breast cancer. Similarly, aggressive forms of prostate cancer, characterized by extraprostatic extension (Stage C/D) or high histologic grade (Gleason score 8+), differ epidemiologically from the vastly more common indolent forms of prostate cancer and are of the greatest clinical importance.

A predictive model was built from the discovery cohort through gene expression profiling of 462 genes with nCounter assay. A predefined cut point for the predictive model was tested in the confirmation cohort. Gene-by-treatment interaction was tested with Cox models, and correlations between variables were assessed with Spearman correlation. Principal component analysis was performed on the final set of selected genes. All statistical tests were two-sided. </p> <p><b><u>Results</u></b><br/> Eight predictive genes associated with HER2 (ERBB2, c17orf37, GRB7) or ER (ESR1, NAT1, GATA3, CA12, IGF1R) were selected for model building. Three-dimensional subset treatment effect pattern plot using two principal components of these genes was used to identify a subset with no benefit from trastuzumab, characterized by intermediate-level ERBB2 and high-level ESR1 mRNA expression. In the confirmation set, the predefined cut points for this model classified patients into three subsets with differential benefit from trastuzumab with hazard ratios of 1.58 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.67 to 3.69; P = .29; n = 100), 0.60 (95% CI = 0.41 to 0.89; P = .01; n = 449), and 0.28 (95% CI = 0.20 to 0.41; P &#60; .001; n = 442; P interaction between the model and trastuzumab &#60; .001). </p> <p><b><u>Conclusions</u></b><br/> We developed a gene expression-based predictive model for degree of benefit from trastuzumab and demostrated that HER2-negative tumors belong to the moderate benefit group, thus providing justification for testing trastuzumab in HER2-negative patients (NSABP B-47).</p> <p>** Reprinted from J Natl Cancer Inst;2013;105:1782-1788 with permission from Oxford University Press.</p>",Soonmyung Paik,16236738;24262440,PA-Cure Grant;U10-CA-12027;U10-CA-69651;U10-CA-37377;U10-CA-69974,Clinical Trial;Phase III,,,,1579.0,1579.0,DS-CA-IRB-MDS,Array_miRNA_Expression,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000826,nan,nan,0446a687-ad94-4790-b11b-1ac8a3ff197e,dbGaP

We propose the following hypotheses: (a) that inherited DNA variation influences risk of prostate cancer; (b) that many of the causal alleles will be outside known ""candidate genes"" requiring an agnostic, comprehensive search; and (c) that performing this search in a multi-ethnic cohort is more powerful than a study limited to a single population to reveal the full range of causal alleles relevant to the U.S. population.</p> <p>The version 1 release of this dataset will include genotype data for the Japanese and Latino populations in the study. The version 2 release will include data for the African ancestry population along with the Japanese and Latino subjects. The version 3 release will include fully-cleaned genotype data for all three populations.</p> <p>This study is part of the Gene Environment Association Studies initiative (GENEVA, <a href=""http://www.genevastudy.org"" target=""_blank"">http://www.genevastudy.org</a>) funded by the trans-NIH Genes, Environment, and Health Initiative (GEI). The overarching goal is to identify novel genetic factors that contribute to prostate cancer through large-scale genome-wide association studies of a well-characterized multi-ethnic cohort. Genotyping was performed at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, a GENEVA genotyping center and at the University of Southern California. Data cleaning and harmonization were performed at the GEI-funded GENEVA Coordinating Center at the University of Washington. As an add-on to this GWAS we performed a targeted re-sequencing of all known prostate cancer risk loci in the samples from the MEC. Sequencing was performed in Dr. Reich's lab at Harvard Medical School.</p>","Christopher Haiman, ScD",10695593;17401364;33398198,U01 HG004726,Cohort;Nested Case-Control,,,,9482.0,11325.0,NRUP;DS-CA-PUB-MDS;HMB-PUB-MDS;GRU-MDS;DS-PC;CHDSADM,Imputation_SNP;Array_SNP,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000306,nan,nan,f96aff31-9c98-4eb0-a6e6-e7156825c1d2,dbGaP

This higher proportion of early-onset breast cancer might suggest a stronger genetic component in these populations. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have revealed several genetic loci that confer risk of breast cancer. Because all GWAS started the discovery stage in women of European ancestry and replicated mainly in women of European ancestry, we propose a novel approach for a GWAS in indigenous African women to identify alleles associated with breast cancer risk which will then be replicated in other populations. This innovative design builds on our current understanding of the etiologic heterogeneity in breast cancer and the distribution of breast cancer molecular subtypes which differ between women of African ancestry and women of European ancestry. The major objective of the proposed studies is to get to the ""root"" causes of breast cancer by identifying breast cancer risk alleles in a pooled sample of women of African ancestry and to replicate our findings in other populations.</p> <p>To achieve this objective, we conducted a case control study of breast cancer in women of African ancestry, including Africans living in Nigeria, African Americans and African Barbadians. We will genotype ~3800 individuals using the Illumina HumanOmni2.5-Quad platform. We will conduct both standard and novel genetic analyses of the data to map genes associated with breast cancer susceptibility, verify genotyping and carry out fine-mapping studies in genes or regions showing association with breast cancer risk, and replicate in other African American and non-African American populations. By pooling unique resources from studies throughout the African Diaspora, this study has the potential to identify risk alleles in several genes that contribute to increased breast cancer risk and may have implications for early detection, prognosis and treatment of breast cancer in ALL women. This should ultimately lead to improved outcomes for those who suffer a disproportionate burden of early-onset breast cancer.</p>",Olufunmilyao I.

CRC remains a major cause of cancer-related mortality due to its metastatic progression and resistance to therapy. To model CRC at the patient level, we generated 3D organoid cultures from primary and metastatic tumors, preserving their genetic and phenotypic characteristics. </p><p>The study cohort consists of 9 CRC patients with microsatellite-stable adenocarcinomas from the ascending, transverse, and descending colon, as well as the rectum, with differentiation statuses ranging from well to moderate and moderate-poor. Notably, for one patient, we generated organoids from both the primary tumor and matched liver metastases, allowing for a comparative analysis of tumor evolution. PDOs were derived from these tumors and subjected to WES at early passage to profile somatic mutations, copy number variations, and other genomic alterations to identify mutational signatures. Mutations identified in the PDOs were cross-referenced and confirmed with mutational data from the Columbia Solid Tumor Panel, which was conducted on all tumor tissues prior to organoid establishment. </p><p>Molecular technologies employed include next-generation sequencing (NGS) for WES, enabling high-resolution characterization of the genomic landscape of CRC PDOs.

To determine TFx, shallow whole genome sequencing of cell-free DNA can be performed from a single blood sample, using an established computational pipeline (ichorCNA), without prior knowledge of tumor mutations, in a highly cost effective manner. We describe assay validation of this approach to facilitate broad clinical application, including evaluation of assay sensitivity, precision, repeatability, reproducibility, pre-analytic factors, and DNA quality/quantity. Specifically, experimental dilutions with normal donor plasma established lower limit of detection; precision was demonstrated on distinct sequencing instruments (Illumina HiSeqX and NovaSeq) with no observable differences; the assay achieved >95% agreement of TFx across paired sample replicates of the same specimen (repeatability) and duplicate samples in different batches (reproducibility). Comparison of samples collected in distinct tube types from single venipuncture, processed over diverse timeframes, and using a range of DNA inputs (1ng-50ng) established pre-analytical variables impacting TFx success. Finally, serial samples from advanced breast cancer patients on treatment facilitate the range of TFx dynamics under pressure. Overall, this shallow whole genome sequencing of cell-free DNA and ichorCNA approach offers sensitive, precise, and reproductible quantitation of TFx, facilitating assay application in clinical cancer care.</p>",Daniel G.

LGL leukemia patients have multiple clinical phenotypes including chronic neutropenia, pure red cell aplasia, and rheumatoid arthritis. The major focus of this project is to identify and understand how genomic changes contribute to the pathogenesis of LGL leukemia as well as normal TEMRA biology. Our collaborative group has completed whole genome sequencing of matched LGL clone and normal saliva samples from 50 genome pairs. Preliminary analyses of these genome pairs indicate an average of 8,000 somatic DNA substitutions as well as evidence of copy number variation and other genome structural changes. Our goal is to understand how these genome changes contribute to the genesis and pathological manifestations of LGL leukemia. We focus on analyzing the protein coding changes as well as identifying the numerous other genomic changes with less rapidly definable function. In order to gain a more complete understanding of how non-coding genome changes contribute to LGL we are also conducting a series of ENCODE type experiments to identify important genomic regions in LGL. We will have utilized targeted resequencing and whole exome sequencing to screen our large patient registry to determine the prevalence of these mutations in LGL leukemia and will integrate the newly identified interaction data and mutation data into our network model of LGL leukemia survival pathways. In addition, we have correlated mutations with clinical parameters to determine their usefulness in predicting treatment responses to current therapies and individual disease phenotypes.</div><div></div><div><br></div><div>March 2021:  WGS sequence data submitted for paired tumor-normal NK-LGL leukemia samples</div><div>March 2021:  RRBS sequence data submitted for TET2 wild-type NK-LGL leukemia (n=3) and TET2 mutant NK-LGL leukemia (n=3)</div><div><br></div>","Thomas P.

This area is settled by the Luo tribe (85% of the population), a Nilotic group, which migrated from the Sudan regions of Africa, and the Kuria, a mixture of Nilotic and Bantu tribes. Control samples were obtained from members of similar families from the same location but who did not have BL cases reported in their family were also sampled. The family study collected data from 320 individuals in 12 families with two or more BL cases (familial BL families, n=63), 36 families with single BL cases (sporadic BL families, n=185), and 18 without BL (control families, n=72). Multiple blood specimens were taken from family members at different times. In addition, samples were obtained from random BL cases presenting at Shirati hospital (case set) and from unrelated community members (mostly adults) who did not have a history of BL (control set).

Reconstructing 	the subclonal genetic ancestry of several samples by CNA profiling demonstrated a branching multi-clonal evolution model of 	leukaemogenesis, rather than linear succession. For some patient samples, the predominant diagnostic clone repopulated 	xenografts, while in others it was outcompeted by minor subclones. Reconstitution with the predominant diagnosis clone was 	associated with more aggressive growth properties in xenografts, deletion of CDKN2A/B, and poor patient outcome.
