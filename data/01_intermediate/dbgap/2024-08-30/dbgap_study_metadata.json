    "description": "<p>PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome (PHTS) is associated with a high rate of thyroid cancer and benign thyroid disease, yet nothing is known of the genomic landscape of PHTS-associated thyroid tumors. In this study, exome sequencing was performed on 58 thyroid tumors (28 cancers, 30 benign nodules) from 19 patients with PHTS, sequenced in tumor-normal pairs. Somatic variant calling was utilized to determine the somatic mutational landscape of thyroid tumors in this population. This was then compared to the known mutational landscape of sporadic thyroid cancer in the general population using sequencing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas. The primary finding of the study was that PHTS-associated thyroid tumors had a unique genomic landscape, including a high frequency of second-hit somatic PTEN alterations compared to the sporadic thyroid tumors. Additionally, PHTS-associated thyroid cancers were found to have somatic alterations in BRAF, RAS family members, and genes associated with DNA double stranded break repair. Data available through dbGAP will include tumor BAM files for each tumor, normal BAM files for each patient, and MAF files for PHTS-associated thyroid cancer and PHTS associated benign thyroid nodules.</p>",

    "description": "<p>This study explores the genomic landscape associated with a novel Fc-engineered anti-CTLA-4 antibody (botensilimab) in advanced solid tumors. We seek to understand if enhancing the Fc-region affinity of anti-CTLA-4 antibodies can improve anti-tumor efficacy and expand clinical benefit to tumors poorly responsive to conventional immunotherapy. As part of an ongoing open-label, Phase 1, multicenter study, we conducted an exploratory sub-analysis of genomics data. The primary study evaluates the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of botensilimab monotherapy and in combination with an anti-PD-1 antibody (balstilimab) in participants with advanced solid tumors. RNA from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor biopsies and matched normal blood samples were isolated and subjected to RNA-sequencing using the Personalis ImmunoID NeXT Platform. We demonstrated that anti-CTLA-4 engineered for enhanced Fc&#947;R affinity leverages Fc&#947;R-dependent mechanisms to potentiate T cell responsiveness, reduce intratumoral Tregs, and enhance antigen presenting cell activation. This genomic analysis contributes to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying patient responses to Fc-engineered anti-CTLA-4 therapy and may inform future strategies to expand the clinical benefit of immune checkpoint blockade in cancer immunotherapy.</p>",

It also plays a significant role in oncogenesis in other skin cells, such as keratinocytes. However, the mutational profiles vary widely among different skin cancers, and the early mutational processes in different cell types from the same skin, is not well understood. Additionally, our preliminary studies also suggest that the mutation burden in different skin cells vary significantly based on risk factors such as the anatomical site and the use of tanning beds. To explore this, we employed innovative Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) tools to perform a site-matched comparison of the genomic landscapes of melanocytes, keratinocytes, and fibroblasts. From 20 biopsies of physiologically normal skin, collected from various anatomical sites across 16 donors, we have performed DNA-sequencing on 106 melanocytes, 78 keratinocytes and 13 fibroblasts. Of these samples, we have also simultaneously performed RNA-sequencing on 78 melanocytes, 46 keratinocytes and 9 fibroblasts.

Uniquely, these clinically aggressive tumors exhibited genomic and pathologic links to pulmonary carcinoids. Conversely, SCLC never smokers harboring inactivated RB1 and TP53 exhibited hallmarks of adenocarcinoma-to-SCLC derivation, supporting two distinct pathways of plasticity-mediated pathogenesis of SCLC in never smokers.</p>",

    "description": "<p>In this study, we will apply a multi-staged approach to reveal genes harboring rare variants that are associated with aggressive PCa. Whole-exome sequencing (Aim 1a) of 2,774 aggressive cases and 2,776 non-aggressive cases of European ancestry will be conducted followed by rare variant analysis of single sites and gene burden testing to identify novel susceptibility loci/genes for aggressive disease. We will validate the most significantly associated genes (~500) through targeted sequencing in an additional 6,415 aggressive and 5,586 non-aggressive cases and 1,890 controls (Aim 1b). Next, we will investigate the clinical predictive utility of the genes/variants identified in 2,291 cases in the STHM3 trial who are undergoing biopsy based on PSA and genetic risk score stratification (Aim 2). Through this tiered approach we expect to significantly advance knowledge of aggressive PCa etiology and health disparities as well as guide the development of early detection and prognostic strategies for the subset of men who are most susceptible to this fatal form of disease. In this case-case study of aggressive vs non aggressive prostate cancer, aggressive cases are defined as prostate cancer as cause of death, (T4 disease or T3 disease) and Gleason 8+. Non-aggressive cases are men with T1/2 disease and Gleason <=6. In Aim 2, a clinically important disease is defined as a case with Gleason 7+.

From these cases, we separately microdissected the surrounding normal skin, the actinic keratosis, and the cSCC, and we performed targeted DNA-sequencing on the tissue from each area. We reconstructed tumor phylogenies and performed spatial transcriptomics on the 10X FFPE Visium platform on a subset of cases.

We posited that cryoablation could alter the immune microenvironment by directly influencing the tumor, potentially eliciting an anti-tumor response in cases resistant to immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI). In this non-randomized phase II single-center study (<a href=\"https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03290677\" target=\"_blank\">NCT03290677</a>), individuals with unresectable melanoma experiencing progression on ICI underwent cryoablation in a single progressing metastasis, while ICI was continued for at least two additional cycles. The main objectives were to assess safety and feasibility and to evaluate tumor response in non-ablated lesions. Between May 2018 and July 2020, 17 patients participated in the study. The treatment regimen proved safe, revealing an objective response rate of 23.5% and a disease control rate of 41% (comprising 4 partial responses and 3 stable diseases). </p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"> </p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In our investigation into the factors influencing response to cryoablation therapy in ICI-resistant melanoma, we conducted single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) using both 10x Genomics and Smart-seq2 technologies on biopsies from metastatic sites of 15 patients. We collected pre-treatment samples from all patients and post-treatment samples from 5 patients, totaling 20 samples. After quality control, excluding cells specific to anatomical sites or rare cell types (e.g., alveolar type II, neurons), and batch correction, we analyzed 49,071 single cells spanning melanocyte, endothelial, stromal, T, myeloid, and B/plasma cell lineages. </p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"> </p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Differential gene expression (DGE) analysis between myeloid cells identified the genes <i><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4082\" target=\"_blank\">MARCKS</a></i> and <i><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3586\" target=\"_blank\">IL10</a></i>, two genes involved in anti-inflammatory responses that can inhibit macrophages activation to be associated with failed response.

    "description": "<p>Recently, significant progress has been made in characterizing and sequencing the genomic alterations in statistically robust numbers of samples from several types of cancer. For example, <a href=\"https://www.genome.gov/Funded-Programs-Projects/Cancer-Genome-Atlas\" target=\"_blank\">The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)</a>, <a href=\"https://docs.icgc-argo.org/docs/data-access/icgc-25k-data\" target=\"_blank\">International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC)</a> and other similar efforts are identifying genomic alterations associated with specific cancers (e.g., copy number aberrations, rearrangements, point mutations, epigenomic changes, etc.) The availability of these multi-dimensional data to the scientific community sets the stage for the development of new molecularly targeted cancer interventions. Understanding the comprehensive functional changes in cancer proteomes arising from genomic alterations and other factors is the next logical step in the development of high-value candidate protein biomarkers. Hence, proteomics can greatly advance the understanding of molecular mechanisms of disease pathology via the analysis of changes in protein expression, their modifications and variations, as well as protein=protein interaction, signaling pathways and networks responsible for cellular functions such as apoptosis and oncogenesis. Realizing this great potential, the NCI launched the third phase of the CPTC initiative in September 2016. As the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium, CPTAC continues to define cancer proteomes on genomically-characterized biospecimens. The purpose of this integrative approach was to provide the broad scientific community with knowledge that links genotype to proteotype and ultimately phenotype. In this third phase of CPTAC, the program aims to expand on CPTAC II and genomically and proteomically characterize over 2000 samples from 10 cancer types (Lung Adenocarcinoma, Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma, Glioblastoma Multiforme, Acute Myeloid Leukemia, Clear cell renal Carcinoma, Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma, Cutaneous Melanoma, Sarcoma, Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma, Uterine Corpus Endometrial Carcinoma) .Germline DNA is obtained from blood and Normal control samples for proteomics varied by organ site.

    "description": "<p>Early detection of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) associated peripheral nerve sheath tumors (PNST) informs clinical decision-making, potentially averting deadly outcomes. Here, we describe a cell-free DNA (cfDNA) fragmentomic approach which distinguishes non-malignant, pre-malignant and malignant forms of NF1 PNST. Using plasma samples from a novel cohort of 101 NF1 patients and 21 healthy controls, we validated that our previous cfDNA copy number alteration (CNA)-based approach identifies malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) but cannot distinguish among benign and premalignant states. We therefore investigated the ability of fragment-based cfDNA features to differentiate NF1-associated tumors including binned genome-wide fragment length ratios, end motif analysis, and non-negative matrix factorization deconvolution of fragment lengths. Fragmentomic methods were able to differentiate pre-malignant states including atypical neurofibromas (AN). Fragmentomics also adjudicated AN cases suspicious for MPNST, correctly diagnosing samples noninvasively, which could have informed clinical management. Overall, this study pioneers the early detection of malignant and premalignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors in NF1 patients using plasma cfDNA fragmentomics. In addition to screening applications, this novel approach distinguishes atypical neurofibromas from benign plexiform neurofibromas and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, enabling more precise clinical diagnosis and management.</p>",

This resource is helping accelerate not only brain tumor research, but is also empowering discovery for other rare childhood conditions. Brain tumors are the most common form of cancer in children aged 0-19 in the United States, and are the largest cause of cancer-related deaths. The estimated number of new cases in 2019 is nearly 3,800, and thus brain tumors are a rare disease. Despite their relative rarity, the years of potential life lost due to brain tumors in 2009 was estimated at 47,631 years for children and adolescents aged 0-19 in the United States; this is a disproportionate amount of life lost compared to adult cancers and represents an unrecognized societal threat. There is an urgent need to improve therapies for these children. This sequencing cohort defines the largest, clinically annotated pediatric brain tumor cohort study to date and seeks to define the intersection of germline and somatic underpinnings of pediatric brain tumors across a shared developmental context of cancer and structural birth defects.</div><p></p>",

It remains unknown what types of rearrangements underlie TFE3 fusions, whether fusions can arise from both the active (chrXa) and inactive X (chrXi) chromosomes, and whether TFE3 fusions from chrXi translocations account for the female predominance of tRCC. To address these questions, we performed haplotype-specific analyses of chrX rearrangements in tRCC whole genomes. We show that TFE3 fusions universally arise as reciprocal translocations and that oncogenic TFE3 fusions can arise from chrXi:autosomal translocations. Female-specific chrXi:autosomal translocations result in a 2:1 female-to-male ratio of TFE3 fusions involving autosomal partner genes and account for the female predominance of tRCC. Our results highlight how X chromosome genetics uniquely constrains somatic chrX alterations and underlies cancer sex differences.</p><p>This version of the dbGaP study provides a comprehensive set of whole genome data and tables with clinical information collected for the 16 patients (15 pateints as tRCC and 1 patient as ccRCC) in the study cohort. The data also contains 12 RNA-seq samples used in the study and analyses.

    "description": "<p>Lung metastasis is responsible for nearly all deaths caused by osteosarcoma, the most common pediatric bone tumor. How malignant bone cells coerce the lung microenvironment to support metastatic growth is unclear. This study delineates how osteosarcoma cells educate the lung microenvironment during metastatic progression.</p><p>Using single-cell transcriptomics (scRNA-seq), we characterized genome&#8211; and tissue-wide molecular changes induced within lung tissues by disseminated osteosarcoma cells in both immunocompetent murine models of metastasis and patient samples. We confirmed transcriptomic findings at the protein level and determined spatial relationships with multi-parameter immunofluorescence. We evaluated the ability of nintedanib to impair metastatic colonization and prevent osteosarcoma-induced education of the lung microenvironment in both immunocompetent murine osteosarcoma and immunodeficient human xenograft models.</p><p>Osteosarcoma cells induced acute alveolar epithelial injury upon lung dissemination. scRNA-seq demonstrated that the surrounding lung stroma adopts a chronic, non-resolving wound-healing phenotype similar to that seen in other models of lung injury. Accordingly, metastasis-associated lung demonstrated marked fibrosis, likely due to the accumulation of pathogenic, pro-fibrotic, partially-differentiated epithelial intermediates. Inhibition of fibrotic pathways with nintedanib prevented metastatic progression in multiple murine and human xenograft models.</p><p> Our work demonstrates that osteosarcoma cells co-opt fibrosis to promote metastatic outgrowth. When harmonized with data from adult epithelial cancers, our results support a generalized model wherein aberrant mesenchymal-epithelial interactions are critical for promoting lung metastasis. Adult epithelial carcinomas induce fibrotic pathways in normal lung fibroblasts, whereas osteosarcoma, a pediatric mesenchymal tumor, exhibits fibrotic reprogramming in response to the aberrant wound-healing behaviors of an otherwise normal lung epithelium, which are induced by tumor cell interactions.<br></p>",

    "description": "<p>The pan-BET (bromodomain and extra-terminal) inhibitor, OPN-51107 (OPN5) was found to alleviate features of T-cell exhaustion in models of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). To evaluate if OPN5 treatment could relieve fixed chromatin states associated with terminal T-cell dysfunction, ATAC-sequencing was performed on CLL patient T-cells. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 4 treatment-na&#239;ve CLL patients were treated ex vivo with 0.5 &#956;M OPN5 or equivalent vehicle (DMSO) in the presence of T-cell activating stimuli (10 &#956;g/mL anti-CD3 and 5 &#956;g/mL anti-CD28) for 16 hours. Live CD8+ T-cells were then isolated via fluorescence-activated cell sorting, and approximately 100,000 viable CD8+ T-cells were subjected to ATAC-sequencing. Libraries were prepared using the Active Motif ATAC-seq kit and underwent paired-end sequencing (2 x 50 bp, 100 cycles) on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 SP sequencer. Analysis of this data revealed that OPN5 treatment induces a unique chromatin landscape in CLL patient T-cells that is less like that of terminally exhausted T-cells and more like that of effector and memory T-cells. In particular, OPN5 treatment reduced chromatin accessibility at promoter regions of terminal exhaustion-associated genes (e.g., <i><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/9398\" target=\"_blank\">CD101</a></i>, <i><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1234\" target=\"_blank\">CCR5</a></i>, <i><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3902\" target=\"_blank\">LAG3</a></i>, <i><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/55509\" target=\"_blank\">BATF3</a></i>) and increased chromatin accessibility at promoter regions of genes associated with progenitor T-cell function (e.g., <i><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6932\" target=\"_blank\">TCF7</a></i>, <i><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3558\" target=\"_blank\">IL2</a></i>, <i><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/643\" target=\"_blank\">CXCR5</a></i>, <i><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3458\" target=\"_blank\">IFNG</a></i>).

Lower intensity and better-tolerated, cost-effective treatment strategies are needed for these patients. Low vitamin D levels at diagnosis of indolent lymphomas are strongly associated with inferior outcomes to treatment. Standard therapy for low tumor burden, indolent lymphoma includes a single agent monoclonal antibody (rituximab). In our double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial we evaluated if vitamin D supplementation with 2000IU oral cholecalciferol daily for three years improved the progression-free survival of patients with indolent lymphoma treated with single agent rituximab. Stratification factors for randomization included histology and Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index (FL-IPI) prognostic score. The primary endpoint of the trial was progression-free survival over three years; secondary endpoints included response at 13 weeks, and overall survival. Eligible participants were adults with biopsy proven follicular lymphoma (grades 1-3a), small lymphocytic lymphoma, marginal zone lymphoma and mucosal-associated lymphoid tissue with no prior anti-lymphoma systemic therapy. Participants had Ann Arbor stage II or greater, measurable disease defined by Lugano criteria. Participants with osteoporosis requiring prescription treatment, symptomatic primary hyperthyroidism, hypercalcemia, creatinine greater than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal or a history of calcium-related kidney stones were excluded. <br>Germline DNA was isolated from saliva samples obtained from participants at baseline.

Using the sscf-MeDIP-Seq method, we analyzed plasma cfDNA methylomes of 271 samples from subjects with liver cancer and brain cancer and from individuals without cancer (controls). Among them, 215 samples were chosen as the discovery cohort for the identification of DMRs and DHMRs specific in each subject group and for the training of machine learning models of multi-cancer detection (MCD) using DMRs, DHMRs and DMRs+DHMRs as inputs. These models were then used to predict the 56 samples in the validation cohort. We found that models trained with DMRs+DHMRs as inputs in general outperformed models trained with DMRs or DHMRs alone, with AUROC being 0.971, 0.981, and 0.99 in predicting control, liver and brain cancer samples in the validation cohort, respectively, by the DMR+DHMR-trained models. </p>",

Here, data from two trials, <a href=\"https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03068819\" target=\"_blank\">NCT03068819</a> and <a href=\"https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02782546\" target=\"_blank\">NCT02782546</a>, are presented.</p><p><b>Cytokine Induced Memory-like NK Cell Adoptive Therapy for Relapsed AML after Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplant in Children and Adults </b>(<a href=\"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=NCT03068819\" target=\"_blank\">NCT03068819</a>)</p><p>Pediatric and young adult (YA) patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who relapse after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) have extremely poor prognosis. Standard salvage chemotherapy and donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) have little curative potential. Previous studies showed that natural killer (NK) cells can be stimulated <i>ex vivo</i> with interleukin-12 (IL-12), IL-15, and IL-18 to generate memory-like (ML) NK cells with enhanced anti-leukemia responses. We treated nine pediatric/YA patients with post-HCT relapsed AML with donor ML NK cells on a phase I trial. Patients received fludarabine, cytarabine, and filgrastim followed two weeks later by infusion of DLI and ML NK cells from the original HCT donor. ML NK cells were successfully generated from haploidentical, matched-related and matched-unrelated donors. Following infusion, donor-derived ML NK cells expanded and maintained ML multidimensional mass cytometry phenotype for over 3 months. Furthermore, ML NK cells exhibited persistent functional responses as evidenced by leukemia-triggered IFN-gamma production. Following DLI and ML NK cell adoptive transfer, 4 of 8 evaluable patients achieved complete remission at day 28. Two patients maintained a durable remission for over 3 months with one patient in remission for greater than two years. No significant toxicity was experienced. This study demonstrates that in a compatible immune environment post-HCT, donor ML NK cells robustly expand and persist with potent anti-leukemic activity in the absence of exogenous cytokines. ML NK cells in combination with DLI present a novel immunotherapy platform for AML that has relapsed after allogeneic HCT. This trial was registered at <a href=\"https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03068819\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03068819</a>.</p><p><b>A Phase II Study of Cytokine Induced Memory-like NK Cell Adoptive Therapy after Haploidentical Donor Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation</b> (<a href=\"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=NCT02782546\" target=\"_blank\">NCT02782546</a>)</p><p>Natural killer (NK) cells are innate lymphoid cells that eliminate cancer cells, produce cytokines, and are being investigated as a nascent cellular immunotherapy. Impaired NK cell function, expansion, and persistence remain key challenges for optimal clinical translation. One promising strategy to overcome these challenges is cytokine-induced memory-like (ML) differentiation, whereby NK cells acquire enhanced anti-tumor function following stimulation with IL-12, IL-15, and IL-18. Here, reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) for HLA-haploidentical hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) was augmented with same-donor ML NK cells on Day 7 and 3 weeks of N-803 (IL-15 superagonist) to treat patients with relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in the clinical trial (<a href=\"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=NCT02782546\" target=\"_blank\">NCT02782546</a>). In 15 patients, donor ML NK cells were well-tolerated and 87% of patients achieved a composite complete response at Day 28, which corresponded with clearing high-risk mutations, including TP53 variants. NK cells were the major blood lymphocytes for two months post-HCT with prolific expansion (1104-fold) over 1-2 weeks. Multidimensional mass cytometry and CITE-seq identified donor ML NK cells as distinct from conventional NK cells and persisting for over two months. ML NK cells expressed CD16, CD57, and high granzyme B and perforin, along with a unique transcription factor profile. ML NK cells differentiated in patients had enhanced <i>ex vivo</i> function compared to conventional NK cells from both patient and healthy donors. Overall, same-donor ML NK cell therapy with 3 weeks of N-803 support safely augmented RIC haplo-HCT for AML, with ML NK cells demonstrating enhanced <i>in vivo</i> persistence and functionality, overcoming barriers in the field.</p>",

Since DNMT3A is a methyltransferase, we examined the effect of those mutations on epigenetic regulation using whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS). We also assessed any changes in gene expression using RNA-sequencing. We found that T-ALL patients with DNMT3A mutations are resistant to apoptosis and some chemotherapies. WGBS showed that DNMT3A mutated patients clustered together by their epigenetic profile, which was associated with hypomethylation at <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7015\" target=\"_blank\">TERT </a>and HOX genes.

    "description": "The gut microbiota has been associated with colorectal cancer (CRC), but causal alterations preceding CRC have not been elucidated. To prospectively assess microbiome changes prior to colorectal neoplasia, we investigated samples from 100 Lynch syndrome patients using 16S rRNA gene sequencing of colon biopsies, coupled with metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequencing of feces. Colectomy and CRC history represented the largest effects on microbiome profiles. A subset of Clostridiaceae were depleted in stool corresponding with baseline adenomas, while Desulfovibrio was enriched in both stool and mucosal biopsies. A classifier leveraging stool metatranscriptomes resulted in modest power to predict interval development of preneoplastic colonic adenoma. Predictive transcripts corresponded with a shift in flagellin contributors and oxidative metabolic microenvironment, potentially factors in local CRC pathogenesis. This suggests that the effectiveness of prospective microbiome monitoring for adenomas may be limited but supports the potential causality of these consistent, early microbial changes in colonic neoplasia.",

Participants were 52-85 years old never or former smokers, who had at least 2 surgical lung tumor pathology specimens available in the Massachusetts General Hospital biobank, at least one of which had an EGFR mutation by routine clinical genotyping. 10 patients were selected, along with two patients from a family with an inherited EGFR-T790M mutation leading to multiple lung tumors. These patient tumor samples and matched normal lung samples were microdissected to collect DNA.</p><p>In addition to obtaining clinical histories, we performed whole exome sequencing to evaluate the genetic profile of matched tumor and normal samples. The WES data are available on dbGaP. Our data showed increasing mutational burden and copy number alteration with increasing invasiveness, as compared to normal tissues, for the subset of samples that were assessed for tumor invasiveness. We also observed a range of numbers of shared mutations between tumors in a single patient, indicating different degrees of relatedness between lung tumors. We hope that this resource will help researchers understand non-small cell lung cancer presentations with multiple lung tumors. These data may aid in clinical decision making for such patients.</p>",

The pathogenesis of irMyocarditis and its relationship to anti-tumor immunity remain poorly understood. We sought to define immune responses in heart, tumor, and blood in irMyocarditis patients and controls by leveraging single&#8208;cell RNA sequencing (scRNA&#8208;seq) coupled with T-cell Receptor Sequencing (TCR-Seq). Our analysis demonstrated increased frequencies of cytotoxic T cells, inflammatory mononuclear phagocytes (MNPs), conventional dendritic cells (cDCs), and inflammatory fibroblasts in irMyocarditis heart tissue. Additionally, we revealed decreased frequencies of plasmacytoid dendritic cells, cDCs, and B lineage cells but an increased frequency of MNPs in the blood of irMyocarditis patients. Raw data for heart and blood can be found in dbGaP.

    "description": "<p>The <a href=\"https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/hpfs/\" target=\"_blank\">Health Professionals Follow-Up Study</a> (HPFS) is a prospective cohort study of men designed to evaluate hypotheses about men's health related to diet and lifestyle to the incidence of serious illnesses, such as cancer, heart disease, and other vascular diseases. It consisted of 51,529 U.S. male health professionals who were 40-75 years old at baseline in 1986 and completed a mailed six-page baseline questionnaire. Information on age, height, weight, ancestry, medications, disease history, physical activity, lifestyle factors, and diet were gathered, with follow-up questionnaires sent biennially to update information and record health outcomes with every four years to update their diet. Light at Night and Prostate Cancer project uses <a href=\"https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/hpfs/\" target=\"_blank\">HPFS</a> participants to conduct research assessing the impact of light at night on prostate cancer incidence, with follow-up from baseline in 1986 to 2016. </p><p>Average annual outdoor light at night (exposure) was derived from satellite imagery data from the <a href=\"https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/dmsp-operational-linescan-system\" target=\"_blank\">US Defense Meteorological Satellite Program's Operational Linescan System</a> (maintained by the <a href=\"https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/eog/\" target=\"_blank\">National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Earth Observation Group</a>). Prostate cancer cases (outcome) were self-reported by study participants, and then confirmed by the <a href=\"https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/hpfs/\" target=\"_blank\">HPFS</a> team through medical record and pathology report review. The data for this project are arranged in a long format, meaning that there are multiple rows for each subject ID. The various rows correspond to different questionnaire periods. Because the exposure in this dataset, light at night, and several important covariates are time-varying variables, the format of this dataset captures the variation in exposure status by questionnaire period. The outcome variables are incidence of prostate cancer, including incidence of prostate cancer clinical subtypes, such as advanced, aggressive, high- and low-grade prostate cancer. For the published study, please see Chowdhury-Paulino et al.'s 2023 publication in Cancer Epidemiology Biomarkers and Prevention entitled, &#8220;Association between Outdoor Light at Night and Prostate Cancer in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study.&#8221; (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37462694/\" target=\"_blank\">PMID: 37462694</a>).<br></p>",

This group is composed of 29,683 dentists, 4,185 pharmacists, 3,745 optometrists, 2,220 osteopath physicians, 1,600 podiatrists, and 10,098 veterinarians. Among the study participants are 531 African-Americans and 877 Asian-Americans. Every two years, members of the study receive questionnaires with questions about diseases and health-related topics like smoking, physical activity, and medications taken. The questionnaires that ask detailed dietary information are administered in four-year intervals.

    "description": "Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common malignancy among children and young adolescents. More than 90% of children are cured with a combination of multiple chemotherapeutic drugs. Some may suffer from debilitating toxicities due to the cytotoxic drugs, necessitating pharmacogenetic research to search for genetic markers predictive of treatment toxicities, so that treatment can be better tailored based on patients' genetic makeup. Bone toxicities, including osteonecrosis and fractures, most often due to glucocorticoids, are the most common complications in ALL, which have long-lasting detrimental impact on the still developing skeletons in children. In DFCI ALL Consortium Protocol 05-001, a multi-center clinical trial for childhood ALL conducted in Canada and the US, we found that Hispanic children had less drug toxicities to their bones than non-Hispanic children. Although reasons for the observed ethnic differences are largely unknown, patients' inherited genetic background may be at play. This study seeks to perform a novel pharmacogenomic study based on multi-site clinical trials DFCI ALL Consortium Protocol 05-001 and 11-001 to identify genetic underpinnings of ethnic disparities in bone toxicities.",

Tumors are rarely resected, which is a major barrier to molecular profiling of tumor tissue; therefore, non-invasive approaches using circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) from liquid biopsies are needed to help advance research and clinical care for patients with SCLC. We developed a targeted capture panel that profiles SCLC genes and transcriptional regulation sites, including transcription start sites (TSS) and transcription factor binding sites (TFBS). This is a single assay that detects genomic mutations and transcriptional regulation activity based on ctDNA fragment patterns reflecting epigenetic nucleosomal positions. We applied this assay to sequence patient-derived xenograft (PDX) and patient plasma samples. We also performed whole genome sequencing (WGS) for a subset of the PDX plasma samples to validate the capture data. We developed new algorithms to quantify activity of key SCLC marker genes of <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/429\" target=\"_blank\">ASCL1</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4760\" target=\"_blank\">NEUROD1</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/25833\" target=\"_blank\">POU2F3</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/474\" target=\"_blank\">ATOH1</a> and to classify SCLC subtypes based on activity of these markers.

    "description": "When diagnosing cancer, pathologists use nuclear morphology as a hallmark of tumor cells, but the topological changes linked to alterations in the shape of the nucleus were poorly understood. To uncover the molecular changes that occur in the 3D structure of cancer genomes, we integrated topological maps for colon tumors and normal colon tissues with epigenetic, transcriptional, and imaging data. We characterized tumor-associated changes in chromatin loops, topologically associated domains (TADs), and large-scale compartments. We found that chromatin loop rewiring contributes to oncogenic gene expression programs. Whereas TAD structures are largely stable, the spatial partitioning of the open and closed genome compartments is compromised in tumors and is accompanied by hypomethylation and histone mark rearrangements. We also identified a compartment that is reorganized in tumors and is at the interface between the canonical A and B compartments. Similar changes were evident in non-malignant cells that had accumulated excessive cellular divisions. Our analyses suggest that these compartment changes repress stemness and invasion programs while inducing immunity genes, and they may therefore restrain malignant progression.",

Gene set enrichment analysis showed an enrichment for apoptotic pathways, with significantly increased expression of the pro-apoptotic genes <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/355\" target=\"_blank\">FAS</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/581\" target=\"_blank\">BAX</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/27113\" target=\"_blank\">BBC3</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2537\" target=\"_blank\">IFI6</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3725\" target=\"_blank\">JUN</a>. Previously, carboplatin has been shown to activate the cGAS/STING pathway, and here we also found an increase in STING signaling, with an enrichment for the cytosolic DNA sensing pathway and increased expression of <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/340061\" target=\"_blank\">STING1</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6772\" target=\"_blank\">STAT1</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6773\" target=\"_blank\">STAT2</a>. There was also a significant increase in the expression of genes involved in T cell chemotaxis, including <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3627\" target=\"_blank\">CXCL10</a>, <a href=\"http://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6373\" target=\"_blank\">CXCL11</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6364\" target=\"_blank\">CCL20</a>. Collectively, carboplatin-induced cell death in tumor cells likely initiated a pro-inflammatory phenotype in prostate cancer PDXs.</p><p><b>2. Co-Targeting BET, CBP, and p300 Inhibits Neuroendocrine Signaling in Androgen Receptor-Null Prostate Cancer</b></p><p>The landscape of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is characterized by a multitude of phenotypes, among which neuroendocrine disease holds a prominent position, each displaying unique responses to therapeutic interventions. The efficacy of inhibitors targeting BET and CBP/p300 in prostate cancer treatment is widely acknowledged, primarily due to their ability to attenuate androgen receptor (AR) signaling. However, the effectiveness of these inhibitors in prostate cancers devoid of AR remains uncertain.</p><p>This investigation sought to elucidate the role of BRD4, CBP, and p300, which are co-expressed in both AR-positive and AR-null prostate cancer. Our study revealed that a compound targeting all three proteins, NEO2734, exhibited efficacy in suppressing the growth of organoids from both AR-positive and AR-null tumors, as evidenced by alterations in viability, size, and cellular composition. Furthermore, NEO2734 treatment consistently led to transcriptional downregulation of cell cycle pathways across various models. </p><p>In the context of neuroendocrine prostate cancer, NEO2734 demonstrated notable efficacy. Treatment with NEO2734 resulted in decreased expression of <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/429\" target=\"_blank\">ASCL1</a> and other neuroendocrine markers, accompanied by a reduction in tumor growth <i>in vivo</i>. These findings collectively underscore the potential of epigenome-targeted inhibitors in impeding the growth of neuroendocrine prostate cancer, by disrupting lineage regulators in a phenotype-dependent manner. </p><p>In this study, we examined the impact of NEO2734 treatment on 6 organoids (treated for 24 hrs) and 2 patient-derived xenografts (at two time points) using bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq). These results are available through this dbGaP submission. </p><p>The implications of these results warrant further exploration and development of compounds possessing similar activities for clinical applications. The ability of NEO2734 to mitigate the growth of both AR-positive and AR-null prostate cancer underscores its potential as a versatile therapeutic agent. Moreover, its efficacy in targeting neuroendocrine phenotypes offers promising avenues for addressing a subtype of CRPC that poses significant clinical challenges. </p><p>In conclusion, this study sheds light on the intricate interplay between epigenetic regulators and prostate cancer phenotypes. The observed effects of NEO2734 on growth inhibition and phenotype-specific disruption highlight the importance of continued research into compounds with similar epigenome-targeting mechanisms for advancing precision medicine approaches in the treatment of prostate cancer.</p><p><b>3. Defining Focal Neuroendocrine Differentiation as a Transcriptionally Distinct Form of Prostate Cancer Pathology Characterized by the Expression of Androgen Receptors.</b></p><p>The study aimed to understand the transcriptional differences among different neuroendocrine pathologies of prostate cancer. The study hypothesized that the diverse neuroendocrine pathology observed in prostate might be attributable to differences in transcriptional level that remain hidden in bulk RNA-Seq data. </p><p>To investigate, we employed scRNA-seq to generate gene expression profiles of 18,632 individual tumor cells from 9 patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models representing five distinct neuroendocrine pathologies of prostate cancer. Our analysis identified 3-8 transcriptionally distinct sub-populations per PDX. The expression of key oncogenic signaling pathways and master regulator activity varied across in neuroendocrine pathologies, with each type of pathology displaying a unique set of transcriptional sub-populations. We discovered that, like the amphicrine pathology, focal neuroendocrine differentiation (focal NED) cells maintain androgen receptor (AR) signaling. However, the expression profiles of focal NED cells differed from the other pathologies, indicating it should be considered as a distinct type of neuroendocrine pathology in prostate cancer. Analysis of copy number alterations suggested little clonal divergence between focal NED cells and neighboring adenocarcinoma cells, emphasizing the transcriptional distinctiveness of focal NED.</p><p>Overall, the findings suggest potential differences in treatment approaches for tumors from prostate cancer patients showing neuroendocrine pathology, especially focal NED.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p><b> </b></p><p><b> </b></p><p><b> </b></p><p><b> </b></p><p><b> </b></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>",

We assessed these specimens using whole exome sequencing, RNA-sequencing, and ex vivo drug sensitivity analyses. Our data reveal novel mutational events not previously detected in AML. We show association of drug response with mutational status, including instances of drug sensitivity that are specific to combinatorial mutational events.

    "description": "<p>NCI's Childhood Cancer Data Initiative (CCDI) is building a community centered around childhood cancer care and research data. Through enhanced data sharing, we can improve our understanding of cancer biology to improve preventive measures, treatment, quality of life, and survivorship, as well as ensure that researchers learn from every child with cancer. </p><p></p><div> </div><div>While childhood cancers represent the leading cause of death in children over the age of 1, they are collectively rare, comprising approximately 1%&#8210;3% of cancers diagnosed annually in the United States. Information on diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes is often stored at the hospital or institution where a child is treated, making it difficult to answer scientific questions about childhood cancer. Sharing clinical care and research data generated by children's hospitals, clinics, or networks broadly with the community can help us learn faster and, on a scale much larger than any single institution caring for children can learn on its own. To exploit the rapid advances in high-throughput DNA sequencing technologies and realize the goals of precision cancer medicine, the UMICH Cancer Center established the Michigan Oncology Sequencing Center (MI-ONCOSEQ). This UMICH Cancer Center provisions genomic data derived from the Michigan Oncology Sequencing Center (MI-ONCOSEQ) clinical sequencing assay for patients that fall within the inclusion criteria of the CCDI data sharing initiative. </div><br><div>An \"integrative sequencing approach\" carried out in a CLIA-certified laboratory is utilized to provide a comprehensive landscape of the genetic alterations in individual tumor specimens for the purpose of identifying informative and/or actionable mutations. Using a number of computational pipelines that we have developed in-house or have adapted from the public domain, candidate molecular aberrations are nominated and then analyzed by scientists for clinical significance and/or relevance. This approach enables the detection of point mutations, insertions/deletions, gene fusions and rearrangements, amplifications/deletions, and outlier expressed genes. Furthermore, we can identify certain germline alterations that may also be relevant. </div><br><div> </div><div> </div><p></p>",
    "history": "<p>Since the inception of MI-ONCOSEQ in 2011, we collected and evaluated metrics that informed our sequencing and bioinformatic approaches, which subsequently resulted in condensed yet robust sequencing and analytic pipelines with clinically feasible turnaround time. Thus, we transitioned from routine whole-exome sequencing of tumor and normal biospecimen to a targeted panel called OncoSeq that utilizes in-solution hybrid-capture methods, focusing \"sequencing bandwidth\" on the protein-coding exons in a 1700+ target gene set. The coverage depth is 3X greater (~200X vsersus ~600X) with this approach and can efficiently identify genetic aberrations in both highly recurrent cancer genes, as well as a larger additional panel of candidate genes with suggestive links to cancer. Overall, OncoSeq reduced the sequencing and analysis timeframe by ~50%. This lab-developed test is CLIA-certified, and results can be utilized to support therapeutic decision-making. Therefore, the OncoSeq assay is used for most routine cases, while the whole-exome approach is utilized for specific cases and/or clinical studies.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Women with breast cancers that overexpress <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2064\" target=\"_blank\">HER2</a> are at greater risk for disease progression and death than women whose tumors do not overexpress <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2064\" target=\"_blank\">HER2</a>. Trastuzumab, a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody against the extracellular domain of the HER2 protein blocks downstream signaling of HER2 and substantially improves the efficacy of chemotherapy in women with metastatic and early-stage HER2-positive breast cancers. Because resistance to trastuzumab eventually results in progressive disease in the metastatic setting and contributes to recurrence following adjuvant trastuzumab-based therapy, it is important to develop agents other than trastuzumab that target HER2 signaling through different mechanisms of action. Lapatinib is an oral, small molecule, dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor of HER2 and <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1956\" target=\"_blank\">EGFR</a>. Lapatinib has shown a lack of cross-resistance with trastuzumab in preclinical studies and activity in women with HER2-positive, metastatic breast cancer that has progressed during trastuzumab treatment. Trastuzumab blocks the downstream signaling of HER2 by binding to the extracellular domain of the receptor. Lapatinib binds to the intracellular domains of HER2 and EGFR and prevents activation of downstream signaling pathways. Because of this different mechanism of action, lapatinib may be effective in trastuzumab-resistant disease. The study will also provide important safety information on trastuzumab and lapatinib combinations immediately following anthracycline exposure, and also provide an initial direct comparison of cardiac effects of trastuzumab and lapatinib when incorporated into a standard sequential adriamycin and cyclophosphamide (AC) followed by weekly paclitaxel neoadjuvant regimen. </p><p>Availability of a second agent that can interrupt HER2-signaling pathways through completely different mechanisms than those of trastuzumab offers the potential for further improvement in the management of patients with HER2-overexpressing breast cancer in both the adjuvant and metastatic setting. Co-administration of both trastuzumab and lapatinib with chemotherapy may be important in improving outcomes in subsets of HER2-positive breast cancers. However, use of two inhibitors of the HER2 pathway will increase costs and may increase toxicity, so it will be important to identify the subsets of patients who would benefit from the dual therapy. Inhibition of HER2 with a single agent clearly is sufficient for many patients as evidenced by the results of the trastuzumab trials. Therefore, co-administration to unselected populations of women with HER2-positive breast cancers would not represent an optimal approach. Given the activity of lapatinib, it is likely that it will also be sufficiently active in inhibiting HER2-pathway activation in some patients to allow for its use as the sole inhibitor of the HER2 pathway. Different populations may also derive greater benefit from one of the HER2-blocking agents relative to the other. Identification of potential predictive factors for pathologic complete response to the combination or to either agent administered alone in neoadjuvant trials would provide important information for adjuvant trials designed to definitively address these important issues. </p><p>This study will compare 3 combined chemotherapy regimens: AC followed by paclitaxel plus trastuzumab and lapatinib, AC followed by paclitaxel plus lapatinib, and AC followed by paclitaxel plus trastuzumab given before surgery to patients with HER2-positive breast cancer.</p><p>Tumor samples were collected prior to treatment and RNA sequencing was performed with this version. </p><p> </p>",

    "history": "<p>SCLC tumors are substantially more heterogeneous than previously appreciated, with most samples retaining two or more subpopulations marked by Ascl1, NeuroD1, or Yap1. Using single-cell RNA-seq profiling, we showed that the relative frequency of each state varied across tumors and tumor composition impacted clinical treatment response trajectories (e.g. Ascl1 high tumors were more likely to progress after chemotherapy and concomitantly had a worse overall survival). We measured the kinetics of state transitions using single-cell fluorescence tracking of ex vivo cells and associated single-cell dynamics with overall population trends using stochastic transition theory (i.e. Markov chains). Our results indicate that the transition rates in individual tumors were largely governed by probabilistic rules with autonomous tendencies that are critical for configuring intratumoral proportions. In conclusion, we elucidated a spectrum of states in SCLC cells and quantified their dynamics, identifying cellular programs that recapitulate neuroendocrine, neural, and mesenchymal development. Our work advances a model of cellular states and program diversity in SCLC and nominates new therapeutic strategies designed to limit the plasticity, and hence the versatility, of this lethal cancer. </p>",

For this patient sample, a serial section of the same tumor was used to microdissect regions corresponding to each of these subclones, and a 'normal' region predicted to contain only fibroblasts and no tumor cells. These microdissected regions were processed for low pass whole genome sequencing (WGS) and CNAs recorded using ichorCNA. An oral biopsy lacking tumor cells from an unrelated donor was used as a negative control for CNA inference.

    "description": "<p>Genetic factors play an important role in the etiology of both sporadic and familial breast cancer. Since 2007, common genetic variants in ~200 loci have been identified in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in relation to breast cancer risk. However, it is often difficult to translate GWAS findings to disease prevention and treatment since causal genes in the large majority of GWAS-identified loci are unknown. Furthermore, a large fraction of breast cancer heritability remains unexplained. Recent studies suggest that nearly 80% of disease heritability can be explained by genetic variants regulating gene expression. </p><p>Herein, we propose three well-powered transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) to systematically investigate the association of breast cancer risk with gene expression across the transcriptome of African, Asian and European descendants. In Aim 1, we will perform RNA sequencing and high-density genotyping assays using normal breast tissue samples, and build race-specific gene expression prediction models using data from 1000 women of African, Asian and European descent. These models will be applied to the GWAS data generated from approximately 320,000 breast cancer patients and controls to impute gene expression for association analyses of predicted gene expression with risk of breast cancer overall, and by estrogen receptor and <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2064\" target=\"_blank\">HER2</a> status. In Aim 2, we will select the top 50 genes identified in Aim 1 for <i>in vitro</i> functional assays to assess their influence on major cell functions related to cancer biology. In Aim 3, we will evaluate whether TWAS-identified genes may express differently in normal breast tissues and breast cancer tissues collected from African, Asian, and European descendants to assess whether these genes may contribute to racial differences in breast cancer risk by molecular subtypes. With strong methodology and a large sample size, we believe that this proposed study should be able to identify and characterize a large number of novel genes related to breast cancer risk. Uncovering breast cancer susceptibility genes will greatly improve the understanding of the genetic and biological basis for breast cancer and accelerate the translation of genetic findings to disease prevention and patient care. </p>",

    "description": "<p>This dataset represents two combined study populations. <i>Serrated Colorectal Cancer: An Emerging Disease Subtype</i> (called the<i> Advanced Colorectal Cancer of Serrated Subtype Study</i> or <i>ACCESS Study</i>) was a grant awarded to investigate a newly-recognized, biologically-distinct subtype of colorectal cancer (CRC) called &#8220;serrated CRC.&#8221; The objective of this project was to characterize factors related to the genetic predisposition, clinical presentation, and prognosis of serrated CRC. The study recruited incident invasive CRC cases diagnosed between April 2016 and December 2018, aged 20-74 years at diagnosis. Cases were identified through the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) cancer registry serving 13 counties in western Washington State. Eligibility for all individuals was limited to those who were English-speaking and could consent. Participation included completing a baseline epidemiologic questionnaire shortly after diagnosis, optional donation of a saliva sample for genetic analysis, and optional consent to release of medical records and tissue specimens related to their diagnosis. Tumor specimens were tested for serrated CRC-defining molecular characteristics. Further, we have vital status on all participants and cause of death on those that have died since enrollment. </p><p><i>Hormones and Colon Cancer: Epigenetic Subtypes, Risks, and Survival</i> (called the <i>Post-Menopausal Hormones Study</i> or <i>PMH Study</i>) was a grant awarded to investigate the impact of post-menopausal hormone use on colon cancer risk, tumor molecular characteristics, and outcomes. Eligible cases were females, newly diagnosed with invasive colorectal adenocarcinoma between October 1998 and February 2002, aged 50 to 74 years. Cases were residents of 10 out of the 13 counties in western Washington State served by the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) cancer registry. Eligibility for all individuals was limited to those who were English-speaking with available telephone numbers, in which they could be contacted. Unrelated population-based controls were randomly selected according to age distribution (in 5-year age intervals) of the eligible cases by using lists of licensed drivers from the Washington State Department of Licensing (for individuals aged 50 to 64 years) and rosters from the Health Care Financing Administration (now the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, for individuals older than 64 years). Participation included completing a baseline epidemiologic questionnaire, optional donation of a saliva sample for genetic analysis, and (for cases only) optional consent to release of medical records and tissue specimens related to their diagnosis. Tumor specimens were tested for epigenetic and other molecular characteristics. </p><p>The <i>ACCESS study</i> was supported by funding from the National Cancer Institute of the National Institutes of Health (NCI/NIH) (R01CA196337, PI: Newcomb, PA), as was the PMH Study (R01CA076366, PI: Newcomb, PA). Additional support for the PMH Study came from the Seattle site of the Colon Cancer Family Registry (SCCFR) (U01CA167551, PI: Jenkins, M, and U01/U24CA074794, PI: Newcomb, PA). Additional support for case ascertainment was provided by the Cancer Surveillance System of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, which is funded by Contract Number HHSN261201300012I; NCI Control Number: N01 PC-2013-00012; Contract Number HHSN261201800004I; and NCI Control Number: N01 PC-2018-00004 from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Program of the National Cancer Institute with additional support from the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center and the State of Washington. This research was also supported by the Genomics and Bioinformatics, Comparative Medicine, Specialized Pathology, Collaborative Data Services, and Experimental Histopathology Shared Resources of the Fred Hutch/University of Washington Cancer Consortium (P30 CA015704).</p><p>Tumor marker testing was performed using formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded diagnostic tumor tissue specimens, and DNA extracted from those specimens. Testing for microsatellite instability (MSI) was based on either a 10-gene panel (BAT25, BAT26, BAT40, MYCL, D5S346, D17S250, ACTC, D18S55, D10S197, BAT34C4) or a 4-marker immunohistochemistry panel of DNA mismatch repair proteins (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2). CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) testing was based on a validated quantitative DNA methylation assay using a five-gene panel (CACNA1G, IGF2, NEUROG1, RUNX3, SOCS1) or eight-gene panel (CACNA1G, IGF2, NEUROG1, RUNX3, SOCS1, MLH1, CRABP1, CDKN2A). Somatic p.V600E BRAF mutation status was tested for using a fluorescent allele-specific PCR assay. KRAS mutations in codons 12 and 13 were also assessed through forward and reverse sequencing of amplified tumor DNA. </p><p>DNA was extracted from blood/saliva samples using conventional methods. The genotyping panel completed was the Build37 OncoArray500K-C, including 1%-6% blinded duplicates to monitor the quality of the genotyping. Quality control procedures were performed to 1) make sure that there were no patterns of missing data by batch, study, or plate, 2) check for gender discrepancies and kinship, 3) complete Principal Component Analysis, and 4) test for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE). Samples were excluded based on call rate, heterozygosity, unexpected duplicates, gender discrepancy, and unexpectedly high identity-by-descent or unexpected genotypic concordance (>65%) with another individual. In addition, variants were excluded based on call rate (98%), lack of HWE in controls (P < 1 x 10-4), and MAF (<5%). Imputation was done using TopMed as the reference genome.</p><p> </p><p> </p>",

    "description": "<p>The long-term goal of the InterMEL Program Project: <i>Integration of Clinical and Molecular Biomarkers for Melanoma Survival</i> is to identify molecular and clinical factors that predict survival of melanoma patients. Our overarching hypothesis is that we can identify factors in the primary melanoma tumor that will lead to more aggressive disease. Melanoma patients diagnosed at American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) tumor, lymph nodes, and metastases (TNM) stages IIA/IIB/IIC/IIIA/IIIB/IIIC/IIID display highly variable clinical outcomes and responses to therapy. We wish to identify robust and reproducible biomarkers or sets of classifiers that distinguish patients likely to have poor prognosis. These biomarkers will help establish targets for adjuvant therapies for this set of patients before the tumors metastasize. </p><p><b>Aim 1. Classify actionable somatic mutations, and copy number variations (CNVs) in relationship to melanoma survival. </b></p><p>In Project 1,<i> Targeted Sequencing and Clinicopathology to Evaluate Primary Melanoma Molecular Subtypes and Outcomes</i>, we will profile 468 genes using the MSKIMPACT &#8482; assay and identify somatic mutations and CNVs associated with melanoma-specific survival, as well as their co-occurrence with other mutations, in 1,000 tumors from patients at AJCC TNM stages IIA-IIID: approximately 500 from patients who died with melanoma within five years and approximately 500 from individuals who have lived at least five years. We will also evaluate the joint effects of somatic mutations, CNVs and pathologic characteristics associated with good and poor outcomes. </p><p><b>Aim 2. Identify primary melanoma DNA methylation profiles to evaluate subtypes and survival. </b></p><p>Although it has been established that melanomas frequently have aberrant DNA methylation, it is unknown if DNA methylation in primary melanomas predicts outcome. In Project 2,<i> Primary Melanoma DNA Methylation Profiling for Evaluating Subtypes and Survival</i>, we will profile the same primary melanomas as in Project 1 with Illumina Infinium 850K methylation arrays. We expect to: identify and characterize DNA methylation-based melanoma subclasses; train, test and validate a CpG signature prognostic for survival from melanoma; determine whether this profile adds information to outcome prediction beyond AJCC TNM staging. This project is based on the hypothesis that DNA methylation in primary melanoma will define subgroups (including a poor-prognosis CIMP &#8211; &#8216;CpG island methylator phenotype' subtype) and that a CpG signature will be prognostic for melanoma survival. </p><p><b>Aim 3. Define microRNA expression changes in relation to melanoma survival. </b></p><p>MicroRNAs have been associated with poor prognosis in melanoma, as well as in other cancers. In Project 3, <i>Prognostic and Functional Role of a Gene Expression Signature in Melanoma Patients</i>, we hypothesize that altered miRNA expression, captured at the time of diagnosis, may contribute to the aggressive behavior of a subset of early stage primary melanomas. We will profile the same primary melanomas as in Projects 1 and 2 with a Nanostring assay. This project will define and validate a tissue-based microRNA signature in conducted to determine whether the prognostic miRNA signature, as well as other candidate genes emerging from other projects, contribute to melanoma survival. </p><p><b>Aim 4. Integrate data from multiple platforms to identify melanoma subtypes and survival. </b></p><p>Despite substantial literature on gene tumor mutation-, methylation- and gene expression-based prognostic and predictive signatures for melanoma, few such signatures are used in clinical practice. Project 4, <i>Multiplatform Analysis of Melanoma Molecular Subtypes and Patient Survival Outcome</i>, will use novel integrative clustering methods to identify molecular subtypes of melanoma jointly defined across these platforms. </p>",

    "description": "<p>Within the framework of the NCI-sponsored Cohort Consortium, investigators from 12 prospective epidemiologic cohorts formed the Pancreatic Cancer Cohort Consortium in 2006. This study, also known as \"PanScan\", is funded by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and involves conducting a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of common genetic variants to identify markers of susceptibility to pancreatic cancer. In 2007, the study was expanded to include 8 case-control studies. The study team includes scientists from the cohorts comprising the Consortium, the NCI and the Pancreatic Cancer Case Control Consortium (PanC4). PanScan I and II were conducted in 12 cohort studies and 8 case-control studies, leading to the discovery of four novel regions in the genome associated with risk for pancreatic adenocarcinoma.</p> <p>The third phase of PanScan (PanScan III) was conducted using recently identified incident pancreatic cancer cases drawn from fourteen cohorts from the cohort consortium, including nine prospective cohorts who participated in PanScan I, and five newly joined cohorts. The nine cohort studies that participated in PanScan I and had new genotyping of cases in PanScan III include ATBC, CPS-II, EPIC, HPFS, NHS, PHS, PLCO, SMWHS, and WHI; the five newly joined cohort studies include the Agricultural Health Study (AHS), the Multiethnic Cohort Study (MEC), the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study (MCCS), the Vitamins and Lifestyle Study (VITAL), and Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT). In addition to the cases from cohorts, we also included cases from the Gastrointestinal Cancer Clinic of Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Study (DFCI-GCC); from the University Hospital in Heidelberg, Germany, which is part of a larger European clinical case-control study (PANDoRA); and from clinic-based cases from eastern Spain (PANKRAS-II). </p> <p>The dbGaP datasets available include all subjects previously made available from PanScan I and II, plus 1,582 new incident pancreatic cancer cases of European descent from prospective cohorts, case-control studies or case series (genotyped as part of PanScan III). Also included are 61 pancreatic cancer cases and 67 control subjects from PanScan I as well as 173 pancreatic cancer cases from PanScan III of Asian ancestry from the Shanghai Men's and Women's Health Study (Supplemental Table 10, Wolpin et al. (Nat Genet, 2014)). The control population used in the analysis for the Wolpin et al. manuscript included cancer-free individuals from the prospective cohorts that contributed pancreatic cancer cases to PanScan III and controls from the Spanish Bladder Cancer SBC/EPICURO study that were previously genotyped using the OmniExpress, Omni 1M or Omni 2.5M SNP arrays. The data from these control subjects were posted to dbGaP under the GWAS in which they were initially genotyped and will not be made available in duplicate under this dbGaP study.</p><p>The summary statistics for PanScan I-III were generated as detailed in Wolpin BM. et al., Genome-wide association study identifies multiple susceptibility loci for pancreatic cancer, Nature Genetics 2014; 46(9):994-1000 (https://www.nature.com/articles/ng.3052), and Klein, A. et al., Genome-wide meta-analysis identifies five new susceptibility loci for pancreatic cancer, Nature Communications, 2018;9(1):556 (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-02942-5). The dataset includes results from an association study of 5,117 individuals diagnosed with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and 8,845 control individuals, or a total of 13,962 subjects of European ancestry (as compared to the genotype and phenotype information under this project that includes 9,437 individuals (PanScan I and II PDAC case and control individuals and PanScan III PDAC cases only). This is due to the fact that PanScan III &#8220;borrowed&#8221; GWAS data from control individuals genotyped separately from the PanScan GWAS project and are therefore not included as raw genotypes in phs000206.v5.p3. Association analysis was performed separately for PanScan I-II and PanScan III, followed by a meta-analysis of the two datasets. Results were filtered based on a minor allele frequency (MAF) &lt; 0.01, an imputation INFO score &lt; 0.3 and a heterogeneity P-value &lt; 1x10-10 leaving a total of 9,758,390 variants. </p><p>Columns in the summary statistics dataset are as follows: </p><p>ID: variant rsID<br>Chr: chromosome number<br>Position: position in the chromosome, genome build GRCh37/hg19<br>MarkerName: variant identifier<br>Allele1: reference allele<br>Allele2: alternative allele<br>Freq1: allele frequency for allele2<br>FreqSE: standard error of the allele frequency<br>MinFreq: the minimal allele frequency across studies<br>MaxFreq: the max allele frequency across studies<br>Effect: effect size for allele2<br>StdErr: standard error<br>P-value: meta-analysis p-value<br>Direction: summary of effect direction for each study<br>HetISq: I^2 statistic which measures heterogeneity on scale of 0-100%<br>HetChiSq: chi-squared statistic in simple test of heterogeneity<br>HetDf: degrees of freedom for heterogeneity statistic<br>HetPVal: P-value for heterogeneity statistic</p><p> </p><p> </p>",

Despite this, mechanisms of acquired resistance (AR) to PD-(L)1 have not been well understood. </p><p>To address the clinical and molecular landscape of AR to PD-(L)1 blockade in NSCLC patients, a large clinical cohort of AR to PD-(L)1 blockade in lung cancer was examined. In conjunction, a systematic genomic and transcriptomic analysis in a subset of patients (n = 29) with available tissue samples was conducted. To investigate the molecular mechanisms of AR to PD-1 blockade from pre- and/or post-treatment tumors, microarray-based whole transcriptome expression data for 29 tumor samples, and whole exome sequencing (WES) data from 34 tumor samples was generated from this subset. Microarray data was uploaded to the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. </p><p>Most AR tumors showed retained or increased inflammatory characteristics with significant upregulation of IFN&#947; which was suggestive of persistent albeit insufficient anti-tumor immune response. This finding expounds upon the prior pre-clinical and translational data supporting the intricate role of IFN&#947; in sensitivity and resistance to immunotherapy. Whereas initial IFN&#947; exposure may be fundamental to T cell activation (a hallmark of immune response), persistent IFN&#947; related effects and upregulation may potentially signal immune dysfunction and IFN&#947; insensitivity in contrast. The inflammatory phenotypes identified have implications for future rational development of new immunotherapy strategies for patients with AR. </p><p> </p><p> </p>",

    "description": "<p>Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (Allo-HSCT) is the only curative therapy for many advanced hematologic malignancies. Allo-HSCT is associated with significant morbidities and mortality, mainly because of the graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) caused by donor T cells recognizing antigens present in recipient tissues, and initiating an alloimmune response resulting in damage to many organs including the skin, gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and liver in recipient. More than half of all Allo-HSCT recipients develop different degrees of GVHD (grades I-IV). About 20% of recipients develop severe GVHD (grades III-IV) that is associated with a very high morbidity and mortality. The most important factor determining the severity of GVHD is the genetic disparities between donors and recipients, as is reflected in human leukocyte antigen (HLA) haplotypes that are routinely checked for donor selection. Even when donors and recipients are HLA-identical, many recipients develop severe GVHD. As a result, non-HLA antigens are important determinants of acute GVHD. An interesting and unique aspect of GVHD is that it is the consequence of an interaction between antigens present in one individual with the immune system of another individual. As a result, genotypes of both donor and recipient, and their interactions affect the pathogenesis of GVHD. To determine the genetic risk factors for GVHD, in the first aim (discovery phase), we will conduct Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) in 3,000 patients who underwent Allo-HSCT and in their respective donors (6000 DNA samples) that are provided to us by the <a href=\"https://www.cibmtr.org/Pages/index.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR)</a>, a research collaboration between the <a href=\"https://bethematch.org/about-us/global-transplant-network/standards/\" target=\"_blank\">NMDP</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mcw.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Medical College of Wisconsin</a>. In the second aim, we will validate the association between high risk genotypes detected in the first aim and severe GVHD in 1,750 donors and 1,750 recipients of Allo-HSCT, and perform the joint analysis with the discovery samples. In the third aim, we will investigate the functional effect of SNPs detected and validated to be significantly correlated with the severity of acute GVHD in mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR), as an <i>ex vivo</i> surrogate for an alloimmune response.</p>",

    "description": "<p>While examining DNA from renal cell carcinoma (RCC) patients we observed a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP; rs58906143,chr3:47163422 C&#8594;G (hg19); E902Q*) within <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/29072\" target=\"_blank\">SETD2 </a>that was overrepresented in kidney cancer patients compared to control patients. This original study utilized directed sequencing of 14 genes. In an expanded study using a Taqman assay to study the specific SNP, a G allele was found in 72/493 cases (14.6%) and 24/356 (6.7%) controls. Analysis by ancestry revealed that there was there was a G allele in 50/119 (42.0%) cases and 21/71 (29.6%) controls in patients with African Ancestry while there was a G allele in 19/335 cases (5.7%) and 3/269 (1.1%) controls in patients with European Ancestry. These differences did not reach statistical significance. Concurrently, we studied the functional effect of this SNP in a <i>Drosophila </i>model. The homologous amino acid substitution at E741Q reduces H3K36me3 levels which could be rescued by wild type Set2. Additionally, the mutation resulted in significant defects in spindle morphogenesis, consistent with a role for SETD2 in alpha-tubulin methylation during mitosis. </p><p>Data available through dbGAP include the 14 gene sequence files of 52 control and 128 RCC patients, the results of Taqman SNP (rs58906143) analysis in text files for 221 controls and 357 RCC patients, and compiled phenotype data including age and assigned race. Due to data use limitations, genotyping data for 8 RCC patients and 83 controls as well as GWAS data for ancestry determination will not be available on dbGaP, but will be made available on request. </p><p> </p>",

The primary endpoint was safety, and secondary endpoints included objective response rate, duration of response, and T-cell persistence. Autologous TIL was expanded <i>ex vivo</i> from minced tumors cultured with IL-2. Patients received initial nivolumab for 4 cycles. If they had subsequent evidence of progression, then they proceeded to receive cyclophosphamide and fludarabine lymphodepletion, TIL infusion, and interleukin-2, followed by maintenance nivolumab. The endpoint of safety was met according to pre-specified criteria. Of 13 evaluable patients, 3 had confirmed responses and 11 had reduction in tumor burden, with a median best change of 35%. Two patients achieved complete responses ongoing 1.5 years later.

We developed a new organoid culture method for cultivating patient-derived lymphoma organoids (PDLOs), which include cells from the native FL TME. We generated organoids from 12 FL patients at diagnosis, clinical progression, or relapse. These organoids were profiled with targeted DNA sequencing and mRNA sequencing. We evaluated the stability of organoids in culture at serial weekly timepoints (D0, D7, D14, D21). We treated organoids with CD19:CD3 or CD20:CD3 bispecific antibodies or unconjugated anti-CD20, anti-CD19, and anti-CD3 as a control, and profiled DNA/RNA at D11 to evaluate treatment response. This system is intended as a platform for advancing precision medicine efforts in FL through patient-specific modeling, high-throughput screening, TME signature identification, and treatment response evaluation.</p>",

    "description": "<p>In this study, we show that the plasma representation of mutations exceeds the bulk tumor representation in most cases, making classic Hodgkin Lymphoma (cHL) particularly amenable to noninvasive profiling. Leveraging single-cell transcriptional profiles of cHL tumors, we demonstrate hazard ratios (HRs) circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) shedding to be shaped by <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=1776\" target=\"_blank\">DNASE1L3</a>, whose increased tumor microenvironment-derived expression drives high ctDNA concentrations. Using this insight, we comprehensively profile 366 patients, revealing two distinct cHL genomic subtypes with characteristic clinical and prognostic correlates, as well as distinct transcriptional and immunological profiles. Furthermore, we identify a novel class of truncating <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3566\" target=\"_blank\">IL4R</a>-mutations that are dependent on <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3596\" target=\"_blank\">IL13</a> signaling and therapeutically targetable with <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3566\" target=\"_blank\">IL4R</a> blocking antibodies. Finally, we demonstrate the clinical value of pre- and on-treatment ctDNA levels for longitudinally refining cHL risk prediction, and for detection of radiographically occult minimal residual disease. Collectively, these results support the utility of noninvasive strategies for genotyping and dynamic monitoring of cHL as well as capturing molecularly distinct subtypes with diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic potential.</p><p>Methods utilized include a) targeted genotyping of baseline plasma samples, b) whole exome sequencing (WES) of baseline plasma samples, c) epigenetic expression inference from cell-free DNA-sequencing (EPIC-Seq) to infer gene expression from cell-free DNA (cfDNA) fragmentation profiles, d) ctDNA tracking in on-treatment samples, e) RNA-Sequencing, and f) Phased variant Enrichment and Detection Sequencing (PhasED-Seq).</p><p>All patients were treated at cancer centers across Europe and North America between 2011 and 2020.

    "description": "<p>Overview. The personalization of therapy for cancer will require molecular characterization of unique and shared genetic aberrations. In particular, patients who have a sarcoma or other rare cancers and are candidates for clinical trials could potentially benefit by identifying eligibility for \"targeted\" drugs based on the \"actionable\" genes in their specific tumor. Growing technological advances in genomic sequencing has now made it possible to consider the use of sequence data in a clinical setting. For instance, comprehensive testing that includes whole exome and transcriptome sequencing may identify biomarkers for predictive or prognostic purposes and thereby inform treatment choices and prevention strategies. Thus, the translation of high throughput next generation sequencing would support a \"personalized\" strategy for cancer. However, the translation of clinical sequencing bears unique challenges including identifying patients who could benefit, developing informed consent and human subjects protections, outlining measurable outcomes, interpreting what results should be reported and validated, and how results should be reported. In addition, we know very little about how patients and clinicians will respond to the potentially confusing and overwhelming amount of information generated by genomic sequencing, and we lack model processes for clinically evaluating and presenting these data. For the promise of our innovative biotechnologies to be realized, \"translational genomics\" research that evaluates genomic applications within real-world clinical settings will be required. This proposal brings together expertise at the University of Michigan including clinical oncology, cancer genetics, genomic science/bioinformatics, clinical pathology, social and behavioral sciences, and bioethics in order to implement this clinical cancer sequencing project. Three integrated Projects have the following themes: Project 1) \"Clinical Genomic Study\" will identify patients with a rare cancer (i.e., 15 out of 100,000 individuals per year) who are eligible for clinical trials, consent them to the study, obtain biospecimens (tumor tissue, germline tissue), store clinical data, and assemble a multi-disciplinary Sequencing Tumor Board to deliberate on return of actionable or incidental genomic results; Project 2) \"Sequencing &#38; Analysis\" will process biospecimens and perform comprehensive sequencing and analysis of tumors to identify point mutations, copy number changes, rearrangements/gene fusions, and aberrant gene expression; Project 3) \"Ethics &#38; Psychosocial Analysis\" will observe the expert review process for evaluating sequence results and will examine the clinician and patient response to the informed consent process, delivery of genomic sequence results, and use of genomic results.</p>",

In this study, MAESTRO-Pool was applied to a cohort of 9 melanoma patients where 98 plasma samples were screened for 22,333 mutations. Additionally, a new dynamic minimal residual disease (MRD) caller was used to estimate the likelihood of MRD detection based on the number mutations and cell-free DNA molecules interrogated which allowed each bespoke MRD test to be properly calibrated against false detection. These developments led to sensitive detection in patient-matched samples down to 0.78 parts per million (ppm) while limiting false detection in negative controls to 1/784 (tumor fraction=2.7 ppm). MAESTRO-Pool and the dynamic MRD caller enable a unique blend of sensitivity, specificity, and efficiency, which will improve the ability to detect MRD.</p><p>The data contained in this repository consists of:</p><ol><li>Tumor and normal whole genome sequencing data used to call patient-specific tumor mutations and design the MRD Tracker and MAESTRO-Pool fingerprints</li><li>MAESTRO-Pool data (enriched duplex sequencing via hybrid capture) of tumor gDNA, normal gDNA and cfDNA </li><li>MRD Tracker data (duplex sequencing via hybrid capture) of tumor gDNA, normal gDNA and cfDNA </li></ol>",

We investigated the relationship between T cell clonality and phenotypic cell states coupling single-cell transcriptome to single-cell TCR seq. The surface expression of a panel of protein was detected in parallel using CITE-Seq antibodies.

    "description": "<p>Ewing sarcoma (EWS) is a deadly bone cancer that occurs in children and adolescents. Mounting evidence suggests that a genetic predisposition exists for this pediatric cancer, although the specific genetic contribution has yet to be identified. EWS has never been linked to a specific cancer predisposition syndrome, although several case reports have been published that describe siblings and cousins with EWS. Furthermore, neuroectodermal tumors appear to occur more commonly in families with EWS. The two consistent epidemiology findings in EWS include a very strong Caucasian predilection and increased rates of hernia in EWS patients and their family members. Finally, the role of genetic microsatellite repeats in EWS tumorigenesis has been recently described, and these GGAA microsatellites are polymorphic in repeat size and location across the genome.<br></p> <p>The study goals of this Kids First project include (1) To identify cancer predisposition genes in EWS trios increasing disease risk, (2) To identify genome-wide GGAA microsatellite repeats in EWS trios increasing disease risk, and (3) To identity de novo mutation and structural variant rates in EWS trios reflecting underlying DNA repair defects that increase disease risk. As part of the Kids First Common Fund initiative, this study proposal will further elucidate the genetic contribution to pediatric cancer development. Around 375 of these trios were selected for whole genome sequencing as part of the Gabriella Miller Kids First fund. The EWS trios have been collected as part of the Children's Oncology Group's AEPI10N5 Study (\"Genetic Epidemiology of Ewing Sarcoma\"), and each trio has associated phenotypic data including a detailed family history. We will interrogate the sequence data using our genomic analysis pipeline at the University of Utah and the Utah Science Technology and Research initiative's (USTAR) Center for Genetic Discovery. We will look for the genetic contribution to EWS and the sequence data with be shared in a repository designated by the Kids First Common Fund.</p> <p>The WGS of these ~375 EWS trios will help us to understand the genetic origins of a deadly childhood cancer and may lead to novel strategies for prevention and treatment.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The aim of this study is to enable the unification of the clinical and research arms of comprehensive genomic profiling in the setting of cancer and hematologic disease. Increasingly, studies of the genomic etiology of cancer and hematologic diseases are being utilized for patient management, including prognostication, informing diagnosis, and evaluating eligibility for targeted therapeutics and clinical trials. Clinically available testing can be limited in scope and follow-up, and thus assessment of the impact on patient outcomes is difficult to ascertain. N-of-1 studies have the ability to more broadly impact our understanding of the mechanisms of cancer and hematologic disease, and can have benefit for the individual as well as the larger population of patients with these diseases. Thus, we seek to study and characterize the genomic underpinnings of cancer and hematologic disease through genomic profiling studies bridging both clinical and research components. We will rigorously perform and vet research sequencing and genomic studies protocols for the purpose of transitioning these assays to clinically valid testing for use in clinical patient care.</p> <p>We have been enrolling patients onto this comprehensive genomic profiling study since January 2018. As part of the genomic workup for these patients, we have been performing tumor and normal whole genome sequencing, whole exome sequencing and RNA-Seq. The project is largely supported by the <a href=\"https://www.nationwidechildrens.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Nationwide Children's Foundation</a>, and we anticipate adding another 50-70 cases per year. This protocol is significant in that it expands our understanding of the etiology of cancer and hematologic disease through a comprehensive analysis aimed at detecting a broad scope of genomic aberrations. Additionally, it improves our understanding of the clinical utility of genomic profiling and has the potential to ultimately improve patient management and surveillance at both level of an individual and general populations of patients affected by these diseases.</p> <p><b>Primary Objectives: </b> </p> <p><b>Aim 1:</b> Use diagnostic, relapse, and/or germline samples for augmented whole exome sequencing to characterize the spectrum of germline and somatic genomic alterations in pediatric malignancies and hematologic disease. <br> <b>Aim 2:</b> Examine gene expression and fusion events using whole RNA-seq \"transcriptome\" analysis or targeted RNA-seq analysis such as the Archer FusionPlex technology. <br> <b>Aim 3:</b> Compare the results of our enhanced molecular profiling vs. that which is detectable by traditional methods as related to cytogenetic, molecular, and minimal residual disease analyses performed as part of standard of care. <br> <b>Aim 4:</b> Examine the utility of comprehensive genomic profiling by collection and evaluation of outcomes data as related to enhancement/alteration in diagnosis, prognosis, treatment management, and clinical benefit. </p> <p><b>Secondary Objective:</b> </p> <p><b>Aim 1:</b> Use and clinically validate expanded laboratory methodologies and bioinformatic approaches to more broadly assess genomic complexity (e.g. whole genome sequencing, transcriptome sequencing, <i>in vitro</i> analyses, minimal residual disease testing, clonality assays, proteomics) in the setting of hematologic and oncologic disease. In so doing, we aspire to make novel discoveries and associations, as related to disease phenotypes and subtypes, variant causality, therapeutic targeting, and cancer biology. </p>",

    "description": "<p>The aim of this study was to identify the germline mutation(s) in an extended family with individuals having MonoMAC Syndrome/GATA2 deficiency but lacking a canonical GATA2 mutation. GATA2 deficiency patients develop bone marrow failure, severe immunodeficiency and may progress to myeloid malignancies, including myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). The definitive treatment for GATA2 deficiency is a bone marrow transplant. Approximately 90% of GATA2 deficiency patients have a known de novo or inherited germline mutation in the GATA2 gene, but ~10% have no identified mutation. </p><p>The study was initiated with the first patient and her second cousin, both of whom were treated for MonoMAC Syndrome and received bone marrow transplants at the NIH. Pedigree analysis and clinical evaluation identified the individuals in several generations of these patients' near and distant relatives who are/were presenting or carrying the disease manifestations of GATA2 deficiency. Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) was employed on these patients' two related nuclear families to identify variants that segregated with the disease trait and carrier status of their families. Genotyping was confirmed with direct DNA sequencing of these and other family members within the extended family across generations. </p><p>A single base adenine-to-thymidine change was identified in a highly conserved enhancer element ~117,000 bp upstream of the GATA2 gene. It creates a new Composite Element, a DNA motif known to be critical in the regulation of hematopoiesis. This variant is unique to this family and is not present in dbSNP or other variant databases. It segregates with the disease trait and obligate carriers throughout a large pedigree. In vitro studies show that this variant drives allele-specific overexpression of the GATA2 gene in cultured cells and luciferase assays.

    "report_name": "Overcoming Clinical Resistance to EZH2 Inhibition Using Rational Epigenetic Combination Therapy",
    "description": "<p>Essential epigenetic dependencies have become evident in many cancers. Based on functional antagonism between BAF/SWI/SNF and PRC2 in SMARCB1-deficient sarcomas, we and colleagues recently completed the clinical trial of the EZH2 inhibitor tazemetostat, leading to its FDA approval. However, the principles of tumor response to epigenetic therapy in general and tazemetostat in particular remain unknown. Using functional genomics of patient tumors and diverse experimental models, we defined molecular mechanisms of tazemetostat resistance. We found distinct classes of acquired mutations that converge on the RB1/E2F axis, decoupling EZH2-dependent differentiation and cell cycle control. This allows tumor cells to escape tazemetostat-induced G1 arrest despite EZH2 inhibition and suggests a general mechanism for effective EZH2 therapy. Using RNA-sequencing of patient tumor specimens, we identified specific genes as markers of a deficient RB1/E2F axis, which we propose as prospective biomarkers for therapy stratification. This offers a paradigm for rational epigenetic combination therapy suitable for immediate translation to clinical trials.</p><p>This study was performed on archived tumor tissue collected as part of the above clinical trial at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. Patient tumors were classified into \"Response\" or \"Progression\" groups based on RECIST 1.1 criteria. \"Response\" included tumors exhibiting a complete response, partial response, or stable disease. All other tumors were classified under the \"Progression\" group. Archived frozen tumor samples were weighed and up to 20-30mg were homogenized in RLT buffer, followed by extraction using the AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN catalog 80204) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was eluted in 13 &#956;L nuclease-free water. After RiboGreen quantification and quality control by Agilent BioAnalyzer, 1 &#956;g of total RNA with DV200 percentages varying from 78% to 100% underwent ribosomal depletion and library preparation using the TruSeq Stranded Total RNA LT Kit (Illumina catalog RS-122-1202) according to instructions provided by the manufacturer with 8 cycles of PCR. Samples were barcoded and sequenced using NovaSeq 6000 in a PE150 mode, with the NovaSeq 6000 S4 Reagent Kit (Illumina). On average, 84 million paired reads were generated per sample and 70% of the data mapped to mRNA. For analysis, read adaptors were trimmed and quality filtered using 'trim_galore' and mapped to GRCh38/hg19 reference genome using STAR v2.7.9 with default parameters.</p><p> </p>",

    "description": "<p>Single cell transcriptomics is a powerful tool to map the complex tumor microenvironment, providing unprecedented resolution into cell types, cell states, cell interactions, and tumor heterogeneity. Depending on their tissue site and whether processing begins from a fresh or frozen sample, different tumors require different optimizations in order to obtain high quality single cell transcriptomic data. In this study, we profiled a range of tumor types, varying in cell-of-origin, solid and non-solid forms, patient ages, and transitions. The tumors also further varied in their tissue site and in their sample collection method. To enable profiling of such diverse samples, we developed a systematic toolbox for single cell RNA-Seq and single nucleus RNA-Seq of fresh and frozen clinical tumor samples. We validated this toolbox for 216,490 cells and nuclei extracted from 39 samples across 23 tumors (some tumors were split into multiple samples). The 23 tumors represented eight unique tumor types. This toolbox comprises both experimental and computational protocols as well as guidelines for comparing and selecting protocols for the biological problem of interest.</p>",

Specifically, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute IRB approved the following protocols: lung cancer (IRB protocol 98-063), metastatic breast cancer (IRB protocol 05-246), neuroblastoma (IRB protocols 11-104 and 17-104), ovarian cancer (IRB protocol 02-051), melanoma (IRB protocol 11-104), sarcoma (IRB protocol 17-104), GBM(IRB protocol 10-417), and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (IRB protocol 99-224), and the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital IRB approved the following protocol: pediatric high-grade glioma (IRB protocol 97BANK).</p> <p>Below is a breakdown of the cancer types included in this study: </p><ul> <li>Lung cancer:</li> <p> </p><ul> <li>number of patient(s) who provided specimen: 2</li> <li>number of specimen(s) collected: 2</li> <li>number of sample(s) derived from specimen(s): 5</li> </ul> <p></p> <li>Metastatic breast cancer:</li> <p> </p><ul> <li>number of patient(s) who provided specimen: 6</li> <li>number of specimen(s) collected: 6</li> <li>number of sample(s) derived from specimen(s): 10</li> </ul> <p></p> <li>Ovarian cancer:</li> <p> </p><ul> <li>number of patient(s) who provided specimen: 3</li> <li>number of specimen(s) collected: 3</li> <li>number of sample(s) derived from specimen(s): 5</li> </ul> <p></p> <li>Melanoma:</li> <p> </p><ul> <li>number of patient(s) who provided specimen: 2</li> <li>number of specimen(s) collected: 2</li> <li>number of sample(s) derived from specimen(s): 2</li> </ul> <p></p> <li>Neuroblastoma:</li> <p> </p><ul> <li>number of patient(s) who provided specimen: 4</li> <li>number of specimen(s) collected: 5</li> <li>number of sample(s) derived from specimen(s): 10</li> </ul> <p></p> <li>Pediatric sarcoma:</li> <p> </p><ul> <li>number of patient(s) who provided specimen: 2</li> <li>number of specimen(s) collected: 2</li> <li>number of sample(s) derived from specimen(s): 4</li> </ul> <p></p> <li>Glioma (glioblastoma and pediatric high-grade glioma):</li> <p> </p><ul> <li>number of patient(s) who provided specimen: 2</li> <li>number of specimen(s) collected: 2</li> <li>number of sample(s) derived from specimen(s): 2</li> </ul> <p></p> <li>Chronic lymphocytic leukemia:</li> <p> </p><ul> <li>number of patient(s) who provided specimen: 1</li> <li>number of specimen(s) collected: 1</li> <li>number of sample(s) derived from specimen(s): 2</li> </ul> <p></p> </ul> <p></p>",

    "description": "<p>Pediatric solid tumors are highly heterogeneous, encompassing a large number of histotypes. The genomic landscape of these diseases is characterized by few single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) compared to adult cancers. In contrast, many exhibit a high prevalence of structural or epigenetic changes that alter gene expression, underlining the need for comprehensive genomic approaches such as whole-genome sequencing (WGS). Several studies have specifically addressed the clinical utility of genomic analysis in the pediatric and AYA cancer setting. Review of these studies point to key challenges that must be addressed in order to advance the routine use of genomics in this population. </p><p>We have established a large collection of solid tumor tissue samples through our biobanking efforts. Where possible, we obtain longitudinal samples from the same patient. These primary patient samples and their corresponding germline have been analyzed using whole genome and whole transcriptome sequencing methods and have been linked to clinical metadata using both manual curation and robust methods for automatic extraction from the electronic health record (EHR). Importantly, research-grade genomic analysis is performed in parallel to our CLIA-grade sequencing (&#8220;UCSF500&#8221;) efforts for some of the patients in this study cohort and have been submitted as part of the American Association for Cancer Research's project GENIE and/or the National Childhood Cancer Registry. For our sequenced tumor samples, we have retrospective clinical data and ongoing efforts to prospectively record key events throughout the patient's cancer journey. In our solid tumor program, we have developed many patient-derived xenograft models and a number of PDX-derived cell lines. These unique models have been evaluated using genomic and functional approaches including (in some cases) treatment with conventional chemotherapy or investigational agents. Lastly, these samples were collected from a population that is among the most diverse in the nation and includes significant numbers of Asian, Latino, Indigenous and African-American patients, groups that are traditionally underrepresented in many banking efforts.</p><div> </div><p></p>",

Here, we performed single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) of fresh resections of GEP-NETs, including four pancreatic NETs, three small intestinal NETs, and one perigastric NET. We used single-cell sequencing to investigate the tumor and immune cellular landscapes of GEP-NET patients. Malignant GEP-NET gene and regulon expression was compared with normal, gastrointestinal endocrine cell differentiation and fate determination stages. We further characterized immune-immune and immune-tumor interaction networks within GEP-NETs, identifying novel therapeutic opportunities in the myeloid compartment of the microenvironment. Our findings highlight the transcriptomic heterogeneity that distinguishes the cellular landscapes of GEP-NET anatomic subtypes and reveal potential avenues for future precision medicine therapeutics.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Neoantigens, which are derived from tumor-specific protein-coding gene mutations, are exempt from central tolerance, can generate robust immune responses and function as <i>bona fide</i> antigens that facilitate tumor rejection. A strategy of using multi-epitope and personalized neoantigen vaccination has previously been tested in patients with high-risk melanoma. We demonstrated that this strategy is feasible for glioblastoma (GBM) which typically has a relatively low mutation load and an immunologically 'cold' tumor microenvironment. We conducted whole exome sequencing (WES) of tumor and normal cells from individual GBM patients to identify tumor-specific mutations. We assessed the expression of mutated alleles by RNA-sequencing of tumor, and used personalized neoantigen-targeting vaccines to immunize newly diagnosed GBM patients following surgical resection and conventional radiotherapy in a phase I/Ib study. Patients who did not receive dexamethasone, a highly potent corticosteroid that is frequently prescribed to treat cerebral oedema in GBM patients, generated circulating polyfunctional neoantigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses that were enriched in a memory phenotype and showed an increase in the number of tumor-infiltrating T cells. Using single-cell T cell receptor analysis, we provided an evidence that neoantigen-specific T cells from the peripheral blood can migrate into an intracranial GBM tumor. Neoantigen-targeting vaccines thus have the potential to favorably alter the immune environment of GBM.</p><p>In order to discover cancer antigens derived from annotated and unannotated protein-coding regions of the genome, we carried out matched ribosome profiling (Ribo-Seq) on two GBM samples. We discovered novel or unannotated open reading frames (nuORFs) and their expression levels as well as somatic mutations within the nuORFs, which could be used to predict potential neoantigens.</p>",

We hypothesize that Ca-gene interactions prevent early-stage (incident adenoma) and mid-stage (adenoma recurrence) carcinogenesis as well as span the entire CRC carcinogenesis spectrum (i.e. incident CRC).",
    "history": "<p>Despite a reduction in both incidence and mortality of colorectal cancer (CRC), partially due to rapidly increased use of endoscopy, CRC still remains the 4th most common incident cancer and the 2nd most common cause of cancer death in the United States. Thus, it is critical to develop new primary prevention strategies. High consumption of calcium (Ca) has been linked to reduced risks of colorectal adenoma and CRC, however, results have been inconsistent. NKCC2, encoded by SLC12A1, is the direct downstream effector of ROMK encoded by KCNJ1. Both NKCC2 and ROMK serve as driving forces for reabsorption of Ca and magnesium (Mg). Our previous studies showed that the corresponding reduction in risk with advanced or multiple adenomas was 89% among those with variant alleles in both genes (KCNJ1 and SLC12A1). A large portion (38%) of the US population has at least 1 variant allele in any 2 of 3 genes (KCNJ1, SLC12A1 and SLC8A1), among whom high Ca intake was associated with a 70% reduced adenoma risk. However, we only examined tagging SNPs in these three genes with a minor allele frequency (MAF) &#8805; 5%; rare mutations in these genes are causally linked to diseases with Ca homeostasis dysfunction. It is unknown if these interactions are associated with incident CRC or adenoma recurrence or confer additional protection in individuals receiving endoscopic screenings. We propose to conduct targeted deep resequencing in these 3 genes to unravel functional variants and identify new rare variants and then prospectively evaluate if Ca-gene interactions affect different stages of carcinogenesis, confer protection beyond endoscopic screening, and discover the underlying mechanism(s) for these interactions. PLCO provides a very unique and unparalleled opportunity to prospectively examine these hypotheses. This study will be essential for translating these novel findings to personalized prevention strategies for CRC by identifying high risk populations, thus, maximizing the benefits and minimizing potential adverse effects (advanced and fatal prostate cancer, kidney stones, and myocardial infarction) associated with high Ca intake.</p>",

It remains critical to understand factors that contribute to the high mortality from BC among young Black females in order to improve outcomes. The higher BC mortality rate among young Black females with breast cancer is partially attributed to the disproportionately higher proportions who develop the aggressive triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). In addition to biologic factors, timely access to care, and lifestyle factors contribute to this disparity. Consequently, we sought to evaluate the interplay between biologic and non-biologic contributors to BC outcomes (i.e., BC disease-free survival (DFS)), and to better characterize the highly aggressive TNBC among young Black females based on distinct molecular subtypes. Ultimately, it is critical to assess both biologic and non-biologic factors to fully understand and address existing health disparities in this population. </p><p>Through prior and subsequent recruitment of a population-based study of young Black females diagnosed with invasive breast cancer spanning 2009-2016, we: 1) assessed the contribution of biologic and non-biologic factors on BC-DFS observed among young Black females with BC, and 2) investigated molecular features of the subgroup with TNBC. </p><p>Through this study, consented participants were asked to provide a saliva sample from which DNA was extracted for germline analyses, including germline inherited cancer genetic testing and Infinium Expanded Multi-Ethnic Genotyping Array.

WGS of HPV16+ cervical tumor samples from Latin America revealed that 11/20 tumors with only episomal HPV (EP) had intact monomer episomes.

We have demonstrated that the aqueous humor is an enriched source of tumor DNA. Previously tumoral information was only available after the eye was removed for treatment failure. Due to the AH liquid biopsy, we are now able to assay tumor derived molecular information from these eyes at diagnosis and longitudinally during treatment -- as opposed to only eyes that have failed therapy. We have demonstrated that using the platform we can identify the specific mutations in the RB1 gene that initiate tumorigenesis in this cancer as well as the secondary chromosomal alterations the drive further tumor growth.

This deposit includes additional small RNA-seq data from endemic BL (eBL) tumors and RNA-sequencing data from sorted NK cell subsets from the peripheral blood of eBL patients. The additional small RNA-seq data are from tumor specimens from 17 eBL cases, of the previously deposited polyA RNA-seq data from 28 eBL cases (phs1282.V1). The additional RNAseq data from Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) of NK cell subsets, isolated from the peripheral blood of 7 eBL cases. The additional RNAseq data are from eBL tumor samples of 5 eBL cases, BL cell lines established from these tumor samples and also NSG mouse tumors created by implanting the established BL cell lines into NSG mice. The dataset also includes RNAseq data of the NSG mouse tumors after treatment with Rituximab (RIT) and Phosphate buffered saline (PBS). The fifth batch of data includes mRNA-seq from different passages of a single eBL cell line that have variable EBV phenotypes (low passage with lytic EBV and high passage with latent EBV).

    "history": "<p>Endemic Burkitt lymphoma (eBL) is the most prevalent pediatric cancer in sub-Saharan Africa. Its etiology has been linked to early-age infection with Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) and residing in Plasmodium falciparum malaria holoendemic regions where children are commonly co-infected with this parasite. The etiologic mechanisms involving both human genetic mutations and the influence of EBV and malaria on B cell transformation are not fully understood. However, given that eBL can be cured with combination chemotherapy, treating children diagnosed with eBL is feasible even in resource-constrained settings. The overall goal of our BL consortium is to understand the basic biology resulting in B cell tumorigenesis in order to prevent and cure this pediatric cancer.</p>",
    "inclusion_criteria": "<p>Fine needle aspirates and venous blood were prospectively obtained between 2009 and 2012 at time of diagnosis and prior to commencing chemotherapy at Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Teaching and Referral Hospital (JOOTRH), a regional referral hospital for pediatric cancer in western Kenya. Tumor aspirates were smeared and stained with Giemsa/May-Grunwald for morphologic diagnosis by microscopy. Morphology was assessed by two independent pathologists to verify the diagnosis. Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) were isolated from the blood immediately after collection and PBMCs were cryopreserved for future studies. Written informed consent was obtained from a parent or legal guardian of the child before enrollment. Ethical approval was obtained from the Institutional Review Board at the University of Massachusetts Medical School and the Scientific and Ethics Review Unit at the Kenya Medical Research Institute.

Here we model this occult process by engineering TP53 deficiency in primary human gastric organoids and performing experimental evolution in multiple clonally derived cultures over two years, thereby defining causal relationships between this common initiating genetic lesion and resulting phenotypes. TP53 loss induced progressive aneuploidy, including copy number alterations and complex structural variants that are common in established gastric cancers, and which accrued along a defined temporal order. Longitudinal single cell sequencing of TP53 deficient gastric organoids similarly indicates progression towards malignant transcriptional programs. Moreover, lineage tracing with expressed cellular barcodes revealed highly reproducible dynamics whereby initially rare subclones with shared transcriptional programs repeatedly attain clonal dominance. This powerful platform for experimental evolution reveals stringent selection and convergence at the genotypic and phenotypic levels in pre-malignant epithelial organoids, illuminating evolutionary constraints and barriers to malignant transformation.</p>",

High-risk areas occur across central Asia and from eastern to southern Africa, and in these populations, nearly all of the cases are esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). ESCC has a dismal prognosis, largely because symptoms usually appear late in the course of the disease, when the tumors are incurable. Early detection and treatment of curable precursor lesions and early invasive ESCC in asymptomatic high-risk adults offers the potential for long-term survival and reduced mortality from this disease. Previous studies have shown that routine cytology of non-endoscopically collected esophageal cell samples is not sensitive and specific enough to be clinically useful, so we are now looking for molecular markers of high-grade esophageal squamous dysplasia (HGD), the proven clinically important precursor lesion of ESCC, that can be used to increase the accuracy and utility of this initial screening exam. <a href=\"https://www.cancer.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">National Cancer Institute</a> (NCI) and <a href=\"https://www.thebeijinger.com/directory/cancer-institute-and-hospital\" target=\"_blank\">Cancer Institute and Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences</a> (CAMS) began collaborative studies of ESCC since the mid-1980s in China. The present proposal is designed to characterize the type and prevalence of DNA mutations in tissue samples of HGD and to establish biologic and questionnaire resources for further study.

Principal findings of the study conclude that:</p><ul><li>CAN-3110 was safe at all tested doses (no dose-limiting toxicities reached)</li><li>HSV-1 seropositive patients survived significantly longer than HSV-1 seronegative patients in this study - longer than expected based on historical rGBM controls</li><li>HSV-1 seropositive patients were significantly more likely to clear CAN-3110 (HSV-1) antigen from their tumors based on immunohistochemical staining</li><li>CAN-3110 treatment-induced CD8+/CD4+ T-cell recruitment to injected tumor sites altered TCR beta diversity in both tumor infiltrating leukocytes (TILs) and PBMCs, and initiated changes in specific TCR beta clonotypes and immune gene signatures which were associated with post-treatment survival.</li></ul><p>Data provided in dbGaP for this study include:</p><ul><li>Bulk RNA-Seq data for 13 pre/post-treatment pairs of rGBM tumors corresponding to 12 unique patients (patient 28 was treated with CAN-3110 at two different timepoints). This data is provided as raw sequencing reads (.fastq), kallisto pseudoalignment transcript-level read counts (abundance.tsv files), gene-level abundance matrix (Gene_Level_Expression_Matrix.tsv), and immune gene signature scores matrix (Immune_Gene_Signatures_Matrix.tsv). Sequencing was performed as paired 150bp sequencing on NovaSeq6000 S4 Illumina flow cells. Library preparation varied by batch as described in the included RNAseq_Metadata.xlsx table.</li><li>TCR beta DNA sequencing performed by Adaptive Biotechnologies for 21 pre/post-treatment pairs of rGBM tumors and PBMCs representing 20 unique patients (patient 28 was treated with CAN-3110 at two different timepoints). Note that all tumor pairs with TCR beta sequencing data also have available bulk RNA-Seq data. The TCR beta sequencing data is provided as an excel spreadsheet (TCRbeta_Sample_Overview.xslx), which provides a broad level summary of the sequencing on a per-sample basis (# of TCRbeta templates, T cell fraction, TCR beta diversity metrics, etc.) and as a large tab separated value file (Full_TCRbeta_Rearrangement_Details.tsv), which provides information per sample at the level of each unique TCR beta sequence (amino/nucleic acid sequence, VDJ gene usage, etc.).</li><li>An excel table of de-identified metadata for the patients involved in this study.</li></ul>",

    "description": "<p>Androgen receptor (AR) inhibition is standard of care for advanced prostate cancer (PC). However, its efficacy is limited by progression to castration-resistant PC (CRPC), usually due to AR re-activation via mechanisms that include AR amplification and structural rearrangement. These two classes of AR alterations often co-occur in CRPC tumors, but it is unclear whether this reflects intercellular or intracellular heterogeneity of AR. It is important to resolve the mechanisms of AR genomic rearrangements to develop new therapies and predictive biomarkers for PC. We developed a targeted linked-read DNA sequencing assay to interrogate alterations in AR and a panel of genes known to be amplified or mutated in CRPC. Linked-read DNA-sequencing libraries were generated using the 10X Genomics Chromium platform and subjected to hybridization enrichment using a custom-designed Agilent SureSelect bait panel. Post-capture DNA-seq libraries were pooled and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 using 2x150 bp settings. This targeted linked-read DNA-seq assay was used to interrogate a set of 6 benchmarking samples harboring known AR gene rearrangements and other alterations in AR, as well a panel of 6 patient-derived xenograft CRPC tumors and 23 clinical CRPC tumors. In this cohort, we identified a subset of samples that developed complex, multiply-rearranged AR gene structures in conjunction with very high AR copy number.

Additionally, variations in the local spatial properties of the bulk matrix make it challenging to distinguish whether phenotypic differences between organoids stem from inherent cellular disparities or disparities in the microenvironment. To address these challenges, we have developed a microwell-based technique that facilitates the quantification of image-based parameters for organoids grown from single cells. Furthermore, these organoids can be easily retrieved from their respective microwells for molecular profiling. By employing a deep-learning image processing pipeline, we conducted a comprehensive assessment of various phenotypic traits in two CRISPR-engineered human gastric organoid models. This analysis encompassed growth rates, cellular movement, and apical-basal polarity. Through our investigation, we successfully identified genomic alterations associated with increased growth rate, as well as changes in accessibility and expression patterns correlated with apical-basal polarity. This novel methodology offers a valuable tool for studying organoid behavior at a single-cell level, enabling researchers to gain deeper insights into organoid biology and associated genetic modifications.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Immunotherapy using immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) has shown success in treating metastatic cutaneous melanoma but has limited efficacy against metastatic uveal melanoma (UM), a rare variant arising from the immune privileged eye. To better understand this immune resistance, we performed comprehensive immunogenomic profiling of 100 human UM metastases using clinicogenomics, bulk and single cell transcriptomics, T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire analysis, and tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) potency assessment. We found that over half of these metastases harbored TIL with potent autologous tumor specificity, despite having low tumor mutational burden and resistance to prior immunotherapies, including ICI and the bispecific T cell engager tebentafusp. These T cell infiltrated metastases displayed activated antigen presenting cells, chronic interferon signaling, and diverse TCR repertoires. However, we observed strikingly low intratumoral TCR clonality and transcriptionally non-proliferative TIL within the tumor microenvironment even after ICI and tebentafusp therapy, demonstrating that these immunotherapies were insufficient to induce proliferation of the tumor reactive TIL. To harness the therapeutic potential of these quiescent TIL, we developed rapid tumor transcriptomic profiling to enable their selective <i>in vivo</i> identification and <i>ex vivo</i> liberation to counter their growth suppression. We demonstrate that adoptive transfer of these transcriptomic selected TIL can promote tumor immunity in patients with metastatic UM when other immunotherapies are incapable.</p><p>Data that will be available through <a href=\"https://dbgap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/aa/wga.cgi?page=login\" target=\"_blank\">dbGaP</a> includes raw bulk tumor transcriptomic sequencing data.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments (TARGET) Initiative seeks to accelerate research in novel marker and drug development, along with understanding the molecular basis of pediatric malignancy, through identification of genomic changes associated with the following childhood cancers: </p><ul> <li>Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) - A fast-growing type of blood cancer in which too many immature white blood cells are found in the blood and bone marrow.</li> <li>Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), including AML Induction Failure cases (AML-IF) - Another type of blood cancer marked by too many myeloblasts, an alternate type of immature white blood cell, are found in the blood and bone marrow. Upon diagnosis, AML patients without high-risk genetic markers undergo standard chemotherapy regimen, called the primary induction phase, to eliminate most cancer cells and induce a remission state.</li> <li>Clear Cell Sarcoma of the Kidney (CCSK) - A rare type of kidney cancer, in which the inside of the cells looks clear when viewed under a microscope. Clear cell sarcoma can spread from the kidney to other organs, most commonly the bone, but also including the lungs, brain, and soft tissues of the body.</li> <li>Neuroblastoma (NBL) - Cancer of cells of the sympathetic nervous system.</li> <li>Cancer Model Systems (MDLS), including PPTP - MDLS includes acute leukemia cell lines and xenografts with matched primary and/or relapsed tumor information, NBL cell lines and xenografts with matched controls, kidney tumor cell lines, normal brain tissues, and embryonic stem cell lines that were sequenced for some TARGET disease projects.</li> <li>Osteosarcoma (OS) - A cancer of the bone that primarily affects children and adolescents.</li> <li>Rhabdoid Tumor (RT) - A rare, fast-growing cancer that usually forms in the kidney or central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord) but can also form in soft tissues in other areas of the body. Rhabdoid tumors tend to spread quickly, are hard to treat, and have a poor prognosis.</li> <li>Wilms' Tumor (WT) - A cancer of cells in the kidney that can spread to the liver, lung and lymph nodes.</li> </ul> <p></p> <p><font color=\"red\">More information can be found about each TARGET subproject by following the links on the top of this page.</font></p> <p>Together these cancers account for the majority of the more than 10,000 childhood cancer cases diagnosed in the United States each year.</p> <p>TARGET has employed a set of advanced and complementary genome analysis technologies, including large scale 2nd and 3rd generation genome sequencing, to strategically characterize alterations in both gene expression and in genomic structure (such as deletions and amplification) that are involved in childhood cancers. The goal of this coordinated effort has been to create a comprehensive genomic and transcriptomic profile of each cancer. Integrated analysis of the TARGET data has identified those genes that are either altered in their expression level or mapped to the chromosome regions of deletion/amplification/translocation, as these genes represent strong candidates for therapeutic targeting.

    "description": "<p>Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a group of blood cancers with high mortality. Even though complete remission is often achieved, majority of the AML patients still relapse. Measurable residual disease (MRD), defined as the population of cancer cells which persists following chemotherapy, is responsible for AML relapse. Understanding the biology enabling MRD clones to resist therapy is necessary to guide the development of curative treatments more effectively. Discriminating residual leukemic clones, preleukemic clones, and normal precursors remains a challenge with current MRD tools. We developed a single cell MRD (scMRD) assay by combining flow cytometric enrichment of the targeted precursor/blast population with integrated single cell DNA sequencing (scDNA-seq) and immunophenotyping (<a href=\"https://missionbio.com/products/platform/\" target=\"_blank\">Tapestri, Missionbio</a>). The platform utilizes a custom amplicon panel covering 109 amplicons across 31 genes frequently mutated in AML and a panel of 42 oligo-conjugated antibodies against surface makers. We applied our scMRD assay to sequence 30 MRD samples (multiplexed into 6) from 29 AML patients to study the clonal architecture and protein correlation. In addition, 2 MRD samples were sequenced with scDNA+protein sequencing technology without enrichment or multiplexing. Five patients with AML at diagnosis were also sequenced with scDNA+protein sequencing technology without enrichment or multiplexing. In order to establish the sensitivity of our scMRD assay, we spiked AML cells into normal bone marrow cells. We sequenced 12 such spiked samples after multiplexing.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Immune activation after immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) can lead to a unique group of adverse events (AEs), which have been associated with improved outcome in many carcinomas. The association between immune-related AEs (irAEs) and outcome in patients with sarcoma is not well studied. This study has two components: (1) a retrospective clinical study of irAEs among 131 patients treated with ICB at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and (2) an analysis of a subset of these patients who have whole transcriptome sequencing available for analysis. </p><p>In the clinical study portion, we reviewed a cohort of patients with advanced sarcoma treated on prospective clinical trials utilizing ICB-based therapy between April 2017 and January 2020. The objectives were to pool the safety data from each trial, identify irAEs, and correlate them with best overall response by RECIST 1.1, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Association of irAEs with response and survival was assessed using a Cox regression model. A total of 131 patients were included. Forty-two (32%) had at least one irAE of any grade and 16 (12%) had at least one Grade &#8805; 3 irAE. On Cox analysis adjusting for clinical covariates that were significant in the univariate setting, the hazard ratio (HR) for an irAE (HR 0.662, 95% CI 0.421 - 1.041) approached, but did not reach statistical significance for PFS (P = 0.074), while patients had a significantly lower HR for OS (HR 0.443, 95% CI 0.246 &#8211; 0.798; P = 0.007) compared to those without or before an irAE. </p><p>Tumor samples with available RNA sequencing data were stratified by presence of an irAE to identify patterns of differential gene expression. In total, 71 unique patients had RNA sequencing available for analysis. The transcriptomes of 31 of these patients have been previously uploaded to dbGaP (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs002852.v1.p1\" target=\"_blank\">phs002852</a>), leaving 36 unique transcriptomes that have not been previously publicly shared. Three patients did not agree for their sequencing to be publicly shared. Therefore, 33 unique patient samples will be uploaded to this dbGaP study. Overall, this study found that gene expression profiling on baseline tumor samples from patients who had an irAE had higher numbers of tumor-infiltrating dendritic cells, CD8+ T cells, and regulatory T cells as well as upregulation of immune and inflammatory pathways.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>",

    "description": "<p>The adoptive transfer of autologous T cells genetically modified to express a CD19-specific, 4-1BB/CD3zeta-signaling chimeric antigen receptor (CAR; CTL019) has shown remarkable activity in patients with B acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Similar therapy can induce long-term remissions for relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients, but in only a small subset of subjects. The determinants of response and resistance to CTL019 therapy of CLL are not fully understood. We employed next generation sequencing of RNA (RNA-seq) to identify predictive indicators of response to CTL019 treatment. We performed RNA-seq on leukapheresis and manufactured infusion product T cells from patients with heavily pre-treated and high-risk disease. To characterize potency, we also performed RNA-seq on the cellular infusion product after CAR-specific stimulation. Our findings indicate that durable remission in CLL is associated with gene expression signatures of early memory T cell differentiation (e.g., STAT3), while T cells from poorly- or non-responding patients exhibited elevated expression of key regulators of late memory as well as effector T cell differentiation, apoptosis, aerobic glycolysis, hypoxia and exhaustion. These gene expression signatures, along with additional immunological biomarkers, may be used to identify which patients are most likely to respond to cellular therapies and suggest manufacturing modifications that might potentiate the generation of maximally efficacious infusion products.</p> <p>In a follow-up study, we report multiplex CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing on T cells in humans to test the hypothesis that disrupting genes encoding the endogenous T cell receptor (TCR), TCR&#945; (TRAC) and TCR&#946; (TRBC), as well as PD-1 (PDCD1) would enhance the efficacy of autologous T cells engineered to express a transgenic NY-ESO TCR. We used single cell RNA-seq to comprehensively characterize the transcriptomic phenotype of this T cell product and its evolution over time in a patient with sarcoma. Notably, this patient's transferred T cells that persisted in vivo demonstrated increases in expression of genes associated with a central memory state (IL7R, TCF7). These findings may guide future trials involving administration of genetically redirected, genome -edited T cells.</p><p>In this follow-up study, we investigated whether CRISPR-Cas9-mediated disruption of PDCD1 and/or CTLA-4 could restore CART dysfunction in healthy donors and/or CLL patients. We show that depletion of CTLA-4 rescues the function of T cells from leukemia patients that previously failed CART cell treatment. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing and characterized the transcriptomic landscape of CTLA-4 KO CART19 cells that showed higher proliferation and anti-tumor efficacy by permitting unopposed CD28 signaling and maintenance of CAR expression on the T cell surface under stress-test conditions of chronic antigen exposure. Our findings reveal that selective disruption of CTLA-4 invigorates dysfunctional patient T cells, providing a strategy for increasing patient responses to CART cell therapy. </p>",

    "description": "<p>The HTAN-MCL Pre-Cancer Atlas Pilot Project (PCAPP) is the result of a collaboration between the seven members of the MCL consortium. Across four organ types, PCAPP's goal is to collect and profile pre-malignant lesions for gene expression, DNA mutations, single-cell gene expression and immune-environment. Most PML are small in size and only available come from formalin fixed paraffin embedded archived tissue. The primary goal of PCAPP is to 1) understand the logistical challenges of PML specimen collection, 2) document technical limitations of the assays that are specific to the PML and 3) overcome them to support the generation of a more comprehensive Pre-Cancer Atlas in the future. The current upload provides RNA and DNA sequencing from participants with DCIS who were studied at the University of San Diego and the University of Vermont. </p><p> </p><p><b>Description of the overall study: </b></p><p><b>A. Background/Significance </b></p><p>One of the critical barriers to developing new approaches for cancer detection and prevention is the lack of understanding of the key molecular and cellular changes that cause cancer initiation and progression. Unlike the extensive work that has been done profiling advanced stage tumors, few studies have comprehensively profiled the molecular alterations found in precancerous tissues. Premalignant lesions are currently characterized by histologic changes that precede the development of invasive carcinoma<sup>1,2</sup>.These lesions can often be identified in regions surrounding an invasive tumor or in biopsies taken from patients undergoing diagnostic evaluation for suspicion of cancer. Currently, limited metrics exist to identify lesions that will likely progress to carcinoma and require intervention from those that will naturally regress or remain stable<sup>3,4</sup>. Characterization of the molecular alterations in premalignant lesions and the corresponding changes in the microenvironment would hasten the development of biomarkers for early detection and risk stratification as well as suggest preventive interventions to reverse or delay the development of cancer. </p><p>Our pilot study will establish the feasibility of transcriptomic, genomic and immune profiling of FFPE premalignant lesions from multiple organ sites, collected and profiled with uniform SOPs across multiple institutions within the MCL consortium. We will characterize the molecular alterations in precancerous lesions and the corresponding microenvironment in four major organ sites, in order to uncover the molecular and cellular determinants of premalignancy, and establish standardized sequencing and immunohistochemistry protocols on FFPE precancerous tissue. We will also evaluate the technical feasibility of single nuclei sequencing of small FFPE pre-cancer lesions. Successful completion of the proposed pilot study will set the stage for expansion and development of a comprehensive Pre-Cancer Atlas (PCA) as part of the NCI's moonshot.<br></p><p><b>B.

DCIS lesions from <u>breast</u> tissue: </i></b></p><p>DCIS lesions will be collected from 39 patients (20 from UCSF/UCSD &amp; 19 from UVM) with primary low or high-grade DCIS diagnosed from a breast core biopsy. Subsequent resected lumpectomy or mastectomy tissues will be prospectively sampled in the vicinity of the prior biopsy site using multiple approaches: 1) Live cells (heterogeneous mix) will be obtained as a cell scrape slurry from the lesion surface or by fine needle aspirate (FNA); 2) For a subset of specimens where size is sufficient, a block of breast tissue with DCIS will be fresh-frozen; 3) The remainder of the specimen will be taken for routine formalin-fixation and paraffin-embedding (FFPE). The FFPE sample will be annotated to identify the matched FFPE tissue block adjacent to the fresh-frozen sample and will be sectioned for use in bulk and single nuclei sequencing . We will dissect DCIS, adjacent normal and when available, associated carcinoma. In addition, when possible, normal tissue will be collected from a tissue block lacking lesions as well as collection of blood. A subset of patients (n = 5 | FFPE, flash frozen and fresh) will be sent to the Broad Institute for single nuclei/cell sequencing.</p><p><b><i>2. AAH and squamous dysplastic/CIS lesions from <u>airway and lung</u> tissue:</i></b> <br></p><p>For squamous cell lung cancer, we will collect endobronchial biopsies from abnormal airway regions identified on autofluroscence bronchoscopy or identify PMLs in the margins of resected lung tissue. We will study 20 patients (5 each from BU/UCLA/Vanderbilt/Moffitt) with pre-invasive squamous lesions (moderate-severe dysplasia or carcinoma in situ (CIS)) identified on pathologic examination. LCM of the premalignant region and adjacent normal epithelium will be performed as well as the invasive tumor for those collected from the resection margin (n=5 from UCLA). On a subset of lesions collected at bronchoscopy (n=5), we will collect additional biopsies that will be flash frozen and fresh for single nuclei and cell sequencing, respectively, performed at the Broad Institute. In parallel to the work at the Broad, BU will perform single cell RNA-seq on these freshly cell sorted tissues (n = 5). Blood will be collected on all patients for genomic studies. </p><p> For lung adenocarcinoma, we will collect resected FFPE lung tissues from 20 patients (10 from UCLA and 10 from Vanderbilt/Moffitt) with early stage lung adenocarcinoma that harbor atypical adenomatous (AAH) premalignant lesions in the resection margin. We will LCM multiple AAH regions (3-5 per patient) as well as adjacent regions of normal epithelium and invasive adenocarcinoma. In addition, blood will be collected on all patients for genomic studies. </p><p><b><i>3. IPMNs from <u>pancreatic</u> tissue: </i></b></p><p>For pancreatic cancer PML, we will collect low and high grade lesions from 24 patients representing macroscopic Intraductal Papillary Mucinous Neoplasms (IPMN) (n=24) from surgically resected specimens along with blood samples. Archival FFPE specimens of microscopic PanIN lesions, occurring multi-focally adjacent to invasive PDAC, and archival IPMN lesions (with or without associated invasive cancer), along with the adjacent normal tissue, will undergo LCM and utilized for bulk DNA and RNA sequencing. If matched frozen tissues are available for a subset of these FFPE samples, we will bank for comparison of profiles. Because IPMNs are macroscopic lesions, they provide an opportunity for obtaining the samples fresh and therefore can be used for single cell sequencing (in contrast to PanINs). Therefore, 5 freshly obtained IPMNs will be used for the single cell RNA sequencing studies performed at both the Broad Institute and MDACC, and the matched FFPE and/or frozen sections from these lesions (obtained from the adjacent PML) will be sent to Broad Institute as a pilot to assess \"single nuclei\" RNA sequencing.</p><p><b><i>4. PINs from <u>prostate</u> tissue: </i></b><br></p><p>For prostate cancer PML, there will be 40 samples of Prostatic Intraepithelial Neoplasia (PIN) collected between the Stanford and JHU sites (20 cases per site). At the Stanford site, 20 prostate specimens detected by PSA screening who have/will undergo surgery (radical prostatectomy) for clinically localized disease will make up the final cohort. The age range of the participants would be 40-75, and we anticipate that 18 will be Caucasian, 1 Asian and 1 Latino or African American based on the practice demographics practice at Stanford. Clinical and MRI data will also be collected for these samples. We will collect low grade (e.g. Gleason score of 6/Grade group 1; n=10) and high grade (Gleason score 4+3=7 or higher/Grade group 3 or higher; n=10) PINs from FFPE samples that have prostate carcinoma. In addition to obtaining LCM archival samples of low and high grade PIN, we will also obtain normal prostatic epithelial from the peripheral, central and transition zones as well as multiple samples of prostate carcinoma in order to obtain the spectrum of Gleason grades in the carcinoma as needed. LCM samples will be used for bulk DNA and RNA sequencing. In addition, single cells will be dissected from FFPE samples to prepare single cell RNA seq libraries using techniques developed at Stanford, and FFPE tissue will be sent to the Broad for single nuclei sequencing. When available, flash frozen and fresh samples from these prostates will be archived and prepared for single nuclei and cell sequencing, respectively, at the Broad Institute and at Stanford (single cell only). JHU will also capture 10 cases (5 grade group 1 and 5 grade group 2) of high grade PIN, normal and invasive adenocarcinoma using frozen sections from fresh frozen tissues. When possible these will be from the same patients as the FFPE samples. </p><p>Since frozen sections can be quite challenging to morphologically determine high grade PIN from normal epithelium, for these samples we will perform a number of additional tissue-based characterizations. These will include a multicolor combined basal cells (p63 and CK903) and PIN/carcinoma markers (AMACR) referred to in the cocktail as \"PIN4\", c-MYC (referred to as MYC) protein5, by IHC and mRNA by in situ hybridization (AM De Marzo, Q Zheng unpublished observations), telomere length by in situ hybridization6 and the 5'ETS/45S rRNA7. For these slides, the whole slides will be scanned with a Hammamatsu Nanozoomer with a 40x objective and regions of interest will be annotated as a guide for LCM.<br></p><p><u><i>II. Laser-capture microdissection (LCM):</i></u> FFPE tissue blocks will be sectioned at 7&#956;m thickness and serial sections will be stained with H&amp;E. LCM will be performed utilizing standard LCM systems, such as Leica LMD7000 and ArcturusXT at each site. Regions of premalignancy will be dissected and RNA/DNA will be extracted from microdissected cells using the Qiagen All Prep DNA/RNA FFPE Kit. </p><p><b>Aim 2: Perform <u>bulk RNA and DNA seq</u> on premalignant FFPE samples and compare the genomic/transcriptomic alterations within and across organ sites. <br></b></p><p><b>Rationale:</b> There have been limited studies characterizing the genomic and transcriptomic landscape of premalignant lesions associated with breast, pancreatic, lung or prostate cancers. Characterizing the molecular determinants of premalignant disease that are unique and shared across multiple organs will enable new candidate biomarkers for early detection and novel therapeutic strategies for early intervention. </p><p><b>Methods</b></p><p>Bulk RNA-seq of LCM FFPE tissue: All participating sites will perform bulk RNA-seq in accordance with SOPs developed at BU. In brief, total RNA will be isolated from LCM'd lesion and associated microenvironment tissue using the Qiagen All Prep DNA/RNA FFPE Kit and quality will be assessed with the Agilent Bioanalyzer. Libraries will be generated with the Illumina TruSeq Access kit (for FFPE samples). They will be sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq2500 with 75base-pair paired-end reads. Quality of FASTQ files will be assessed with FastQC. Reads will be aligned to the human genome with STAR and gene-level and isoform-level expression will be quantified with RSEM. Splice junction saturation, transcript integrity, and biotype distributions will be calculated for each sample with RSeQC. DESeq2 and EdgeR will be used to identify associations between gene expression profiles and clinical variables while controlling for confounding covariates. </p><p>BU will serve as an RNA-seq Core to assess reproducibility of FFPE RNA-seq methods across sites. We will perform RNA-seq according to the SOP listed above on a subset of samples for each organ type (total n ~ 20). <br></p><p><i><u>Bulk seq of DNA from FFPE tissue:</u></i> All participating sites will perform targeted or whole exome-seq (WES) in accordance with SOPs. In brief, DNA from laser captured material will be isolated using the Qiagen All Prep DNA/RNA FFPE Kit and undergo stringent quality control to ensure high quality input material for genomic profiling. Purified DNA (ideally 100-200 ng) will be used for library preparation and amplification, followed by next generation sequencing using standard protocols distributed by CDMG. Exome-seq methods are considered standardized, thus we will not need a DNA-seq Core to assess reproducibility across sites. We anticipate local centers will use Illumina paired end reads, following the following general approach. 1) DNA library preparation: Paired-end libraries will be prepared following the manufacturer's protocols (Illumina and Agilent), fragmented to 150-200 bp 2) Capture of targeted exome: Whole exome capture will be carried out using the protocol for Agilent's SureSelect Human All Exon kit. Purified capture products will be amplified using the SureSelect GA PCR primers (Agilent) for 12 cycles. 3) Sequencing will be carried out for the captured libraries using at least 100 bp paired-end reads. To achieve high level sensitivity and accuracy for detecting all the mutations in the whole exome, each sample will be sequenced at 200X mean depth. 4) Read mapping and alignment and variant analysis: Sequence short reads will be aligned to a reference genome (NCBI human genome assembly build 38) using BWA-MEM. Local realignment of aligned reads will be performed using Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK).</p><p><i style=\"\"><u>Data QC:</u> </i>To ensure scientific rigor and consistency among sites in RNA and DNA processing we will include a preliminary analysis of steps in processing and analysis. Protocols for extraction of high quality RNA and DNA from formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissues, which will be used extensively in these studies continue to improve and may have variable implementation among the sites participating in this study. To evaluate consistency of preliminary steps in processing and downstream analyses, we will initially distribute slides from one large FFPE fixed cancer of origin from prostate, breast, lung and pancreatic cancer. Analysis of these samples will allow us to review the DNA and RNA characteristics (yield, purity and strand length) among sites. Downstream analysis of these same samples will also allow us to compare among sites the consistency of variant calls among centers. We will be able to identify if there are some times of calls (such as small insertion deletions) that are more variable among centers versus other types of calls (such as relative gene expression or single base pair substitutions) that we expect to be less variable and to characterize the reliability of findings across sites. We are also including a 5% blind duplicate analysis of RNA sequencing. Samples will be analysed by the participating genomics cores without knowledge of the phenotype. RNA seq and CNA analyses are normalized for batch effects. We will also compare the observed sex to the self-reported sex as based on RNA profiles and exome sequencing of X chromosome genes as another check for processing accuracy and sample management. <br></p><p><b>D.

We collected fibrolamellar tumor tissue and the adjacent non-tumor liver from patients at the time of surgery. We only used tumor tissue that was validated as fibrolamellar by the presence of the DNAJB1-PRKACA fusion gene. The freshly resected tissue was dissociated and grown as organoids. This yielded 21 patient-derived organoid lines. From the tumor tissue we developed twelve organoids from metastases and three from the liver tumor.

Lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) arises in the epithelial layer of the bronchial airways and is often preceded by the development of premalignant lesions (PMLs). Effective tools to identify and treat premalignant lesions at highest risk of progression to invasive carcinoma are not available. </p><p>Endobronchial biopsies and brushings were obtained from high-risk subjects undergoing lung cancer screening at approximately 1-year intervals by white light and auto-fluorescence bronchoscopy and computed tomography at the Roswell Park Cancer Institute in Buffalo, NY. Subjects were selected that had biopsies collected in repeat locations via serial bronchoscopies. mRNA sequencing was performed on a discovery cohort (DC) of samples comprising endobronchial biopsies and brushes collected between 2010 and 2012 (n=30 subjects, n=197 biopsies, and n=91 brushings). mRNA sequencing was subsequently performed on a validation cohort (VC) of samples comprising endobronchial biopsies and brushes collected between 2010 and 2015 (n=20 subjects, n=111 biopsies, and n=49 brushings). Data analysis identified four distinct molecular subtypes (Proliferative, Inflammatory, Secretory, and Normal) in the bronchial biopsies that correspond to a spectrum of biological and morphological alterations. The Proliferative subtype was enriched with dysplastic PMLs from current smokers that exhibit up-regulation of metabolic and cell cycle pathways and down-regulation of cilium-associated processes. Molecular subtype classification in the validation cohort biopsies replicated these significant clinical and biological associations. Airway brushes from normal fluorescing areas of the large airway classified as the Proliferative subtype specifically predict the presence of biopsies of this same subtype. Within the Proliferative subtype, genes associated with interferon signaling and antigen processing and presentation were observed to be down-regulated among dysplastic biopsies that persist or progress in the future. Innate and adaptive immune cells were computationally predicted to be depleted in these biopsies and this was confirmed via immunofluorescence staining of adjacent biopsies. These findings provide a proof of concept that molecular biomarkers of endobronchial biopsies can enhance histopathological grading and that immunoprevention strategies are an important future direction in intercepting the progression of PMLs to lung cancer.</p><p>FASTQ files from the RNA sequencing of these biopsies and brushings will be available via dbGaP.<br></p><p> </p><p> </p>",

Multi-step QC was performed, including assessment of the quality of the nucleic acid extraction, sequencing, and genetic concordance between DNA/RNA sequences from the same patient. After QC, this resulted in RNA sequencing on 348 tumor samples, whole exome sequencing (WES) on 281 tumor-normal sample pairs (n=562 samples), TCR sequencing of the TCR &#946; locus (TRB) for 114 tumor and 10 matched normal samples, and 16S rDNA sequencing on 246 tumor-normal sample pairs (n=492 samples) and 42 tumor only samples, and 167 WGS non human-aligned reads of the tumor samples.

    "description": "<p>The Molecular Profiling to Predict Response to Treatment (MP2PRT) program is part of the NCI's Cancer Moonshot Initiative. The aim of this program is the retrospective characterization and analysis of biospecimens collected from completed NCI-sponsored trials of the National Clinical Trials Network and the NCI Community Oncology Research Program. This study, titled \"Comprehensive Genomic Profiling to Identify Alterations Associated with Relapse for NCI Standard Risk (SR) B-Lineage ALL and NCI High Risk (HR) B-Lineage ALL with Favorable Genetic Features,\" is one of the selected studies under this program. For this study, genomic characterization (WGS 30X, WXS, Total RNAseq) was performed on NCI Standard Risk B-lineage ALL patients who relapse and subsets of NCI High Risk B-lineage ALL patients who relapse as well as two non-relapse control cases for each relapse case. It was hypothesized that the comprehensive characterization of these sample sets will allow the identification of somatic genetic features that will facilitate early intervention to improve cure rates for those enrolled on future trials. Data were generated and genetic subtype was integrated with clinical variables, including age, presenting white blood cell count, sex, race, and levels of minimal residual disease at the end of induction. Additional secondary alterations were identified and included if they occurred in more than 10 patients. The study has been completed and a manuscript has been prepared. </p>",

    "description": "<p>The adult healthy human pancreas has been poorly studied given lack of indication to obtain tissue from the pancreas in the absence of disease and rapid postmortem degradation. We obtained pancreata from brain dead donors thus avoiding any warm ischemia time. We found that neoplastic lesions occur frequently in healthy organs, in donors as young as in their 3rd decade of life. Using the 10X Genomics Platform, we performed single cell RNA sequencing on 7 donor pancreata, 6 of which we separately sequenced tissue from the pancreas head and tail, for a total of 11 sequencing runs. Of note, because one of our runs (containing sequencing from pancreas head and tail) did not pass qc, our final analysis in our study utilized 6 donor pancreata, 5 of which contained pancreas head and tail sequenced separately. This is a robust single-cell dataset of healthy, nonpathologic pancreas tissue and includes acinar, ductal, and non-epithelial cells (myeloid cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, lymphocytes).</p><p>Briefly, the donor pancreas was dissected by a clinically-trained pancreatobiliary surgeon. The organ was dissected into head, body, and tail, with portions of each placed into DMEM media with 1% BSA/10&#181;M Y27632.

    "description": "<p>Radiation therapy is an effective cancer treatment, although damage to surrounding healthy tissues can also occur. Cell-type specific DNA methylation patterns can be used to decode the cellular origins of cell-free DNA fragments, allowing for minimally-invasive monitoring of tissue damage. To evaluate whether changes in cell-free DNA methylation can indicate damages to tissues in patients treated with radiation, we collected serum samples from 15 breast cancer patients at three timepoints during their standard-of-care radiation therapy after surgery. A baseline sample was taken for each patient before onset of radiation therapy and a second End-Of-Treatment (EOT) sample was taken 30 minutes after the last treatment fraction. Finally, a recovery sample was taken one month after completion of radiation therapy. From serum samples, cell-free DNA was isolated and bisulfite capture-sequencing DNA methylation data were generated. Bisulfite capture-sequencing DNA methylation data were also generated from buffy coat and tissue-specific endothelial gDNA samples as well as from serum/plasma samples of healthy controls. The analysis of serum samples from breast cancer patients undergoing radiation treatment revealed distinct tissue-specific epithelial and endothelial responses to radiation across multiple organs. In conclusion, as a proof of concept we show that cell-type specific methylation signatures can be applied to detect cellular injury from radiation treatment using minimally invasive cell-free DNA in blood samples. </p>",

    "description": "<p>Extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma (EMC) is an ultra-rare cancer. Though it has a favorable prognosis and an indolent course, it has high rates of local recurrence and metastasis to the lungs. EMC is most often characterized by a translocation involving the <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8013\" target=\"_blank\">NR4A3</a> gene most often fusing with <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2130\" target=\"_blank\">EWSR1</a>, leading to constitutive expression of NR4A3, the biological significance of which is unknown. Our study presents a case of EMC with case-matched lung and advanced pelvic metastases. We conducted Whole Genome Sequencing to examine differences in the mutational landscape at two different stages of metastasis. This is the first study to our knowledge to analyze mega-base scale structural variants (SVs) in EMC. Our data validates copy number variants (CNVs) found in previous studies. While the primary tumor and lung metastasis had similar somatic variations and CNVs, the pelvic metastasis had more SVs with especially increased mutational burden of SVs in chromosome 2. This suggests that different molecular drivers appear in more advanced, relapsing EMC compared with the primary tumor and early lung metastasis. The sequencing data is available through dbGaP.</p>",

The CGCI program included comprehensive characterization of the genetic aberrations found in different pediatric and/or adult tumors.</p> <p>CGCI characterized a number of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas (including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) from patients with and without HIV+ infection, follicular lymphoma (FL), as well as adult and pediatric Burkitt lymphomas), and additional HIV-associated tumors (including DLBCL, lung, and cervical cancers). All data from these projects is available at the <a href=\"https://gdc.cancer.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">NCI Genomic Data Commons.</a> <br></p> <p><b>Individual project descriptions are available by disease on the substudy pages (links are included at the top of this page). Brief summaries are as follows:</b> </p><ul> <li><b>Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL)</b> - CGCI investigators probed genomic alterations more deeply than had previously been possible by using state-of-the-art RNA sequencing (mRNA-seq) and whole genome shotgun sequencing (WGS) coupled with leading edge bioinformatics, data management and analysis approaches. The project sequenced tumor DNA and/or RNA from 117 NHL tumor samples and 10 cell lines. This included the genomes or exomes of 1 Follicular Lymphoma (FL) and 13 diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) cases, all with matched constitutional DNA sequenced to comparable depths, RNA-sequencing (mRNA-seq) of 92 DLBCL, 12 FL and 8 B-cell NHL cases with other histologies and 10 DLBCL-derived cell lines. The DLBCL cases and cell-lines are from the two major subtypes of DLBCL: germinal center B-cell (GCB) and activated B-cell (ABC).</li><br> <li><b>HIV+ Tumor Molecular Characterization Project (HTMCP)</b> - This project was a joint effort of the Office of Cancer Genomics (OCG) and the Office of HIV and AIDS Malignancy (OHAM). Its goals were to characterize HIV-associated cancers (obtained from HIV-infected patients) and compare them to the same types of cancers from patients without HIV infection. Investigators performed 30X genome sequencing of 100 cases of paired tumor and germline DNA, along with transcriptome sequencing in each of 3 types of HIV+ tumors (DLBCL, lung and cervical cancers). These platforms allow discovery of mutations both in coding and non-coding genomic regions, gene expression and genomic alterations (including translocations, insertions and deletions). Comparing tumors of cancer patients both with and without HIV-infection provides insight into the potential function of this virus in certain cancers.</li><br> <li><b>Burkitt Lymphoma Genome Sequencing Project (BLGSP)</b> - This project was a collaborative effort between the National Cancer Institute and the Foundation for Burkitt Lymphoma Research to develop a databank of the many alterations found in Burkitt lymphoma (BL), an uncommon type of Non-Hodgkin lymphoma that occurs most often in children and young adults. The goal of the BLGSP was to explore potential genetic changes in patients with BL that could lead to better prevention, detection and treatment of the cancer. The project characterized the alterations of the tumors' genomes (with matched normal as control) and transcriptomes by sequencing the DNA and RNA of each case. Using the data generated, the ultimate goals of the project was to discover the molecular changes that are present in BL patients and then determine how those changes correlate with treatment regimen and outcome.</li> </ul> <p></p> <p>CGCI data is accessible at the <a href=\"https://gdc.cancer.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">NCI's Genomic Data Commons (GDC)</a> via the <a href=\"https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">GDC's Data Portal</a> and from each of the <a href=\"https://gdc.cancer.gov/about-data/publications#/?groups=&amp;years=&amp;programs=CGCI&amp;order=desc\" target=\"_blank\">CGCI Publication Pages at the GDC</a> (Please see the \"Supplemental Links\" section of any CGCI publication's \"Publication Information and Associated Data Files page\" at the GDC.).

Current chemotherapy regimens for BL are effective in approximately 40-90% of patients, depending on age, stage of the disease, treatment regimen, and site of the treatment facility. Hence, new treatments are needed to improve the efficacy of current regimens and to potentially substitute less toxic agents for the high intensity chemotherapeutic drugs currently given.</p> <p>The goal of the CGCI BLGSP study was to explore potential genetic changes in patients with BL that could lead to better prevention, detection and treatment of the cancer.

The BLGSP study included adult and pediatric patients with sporadic BL, as well as those with endemic and HIV-positive sporadic BL.</p> <p>The first major objective of the BLGSP was to accrue tumor and patient-matched control tissues obtained by precise protocols from a relatively large number of clinically well-annotated cases of BL.

The initial dataset (added October, 2020) contains 3 samples (3 individuals). The next dataset (added November, 2022) contains 34 samples from 8 individuals. The samples in the second dataset were sequenced in five different ways: 1) rRNA depletion and bulk RNA sequencing of tumor chunks, 2) rRNA depletion and bulk RNA sequencing of dissociated cells, 3) poly-A capture and bulk RNA sequencing of dissociated cells, 4) poly-A capture and scRNA sequencing of dissociated cells, 5) barcoding and pooling cells and scRNA sequencing (2 pools of 4 samples each).",

    "description": "<p>The incidence of invasive breast cancer is rapidly increasing in East Asia, enriching in younger patients and luminal disease. We presented a deep proteogenomic landscape of a prospectively enrolled early-stage cohort in Taiwan to uncover the etiology, age-related subtype and oncogenic vulnerabilities underlying the heterogeneous disease. Multilayer proteogenomic architecture revealed distinct endogenous and environmental carcinogen-associated mutagenesis, linking APOBEC (apolipoprotein-B mRNA editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like) cytidine deaminase and DBAC (dibenz[a,j] acridine) signatures to significantly elevated hormone biosynthesis and chemical carcinogenesis in younger patients, and identifying a novel subset of high mutation burden and immune escape potentially beneficial from combined epigenetic therapy and immunotherapy. A proteomics-informed classification resolves luminal heterogeneity, defines high-risk recurrent luminal disease and nominates biomarkers and actionable druggable pathways. Furthermore, proteogenomics profile distinguished a young luminal population susceptible to exogenous carcinogen and having DNA repair deficiency. This study illuminates the age-related molecular subtypes and oncogenic vulnerabilities, providing a proteogenomics-transformative guide for patient stratification and precision therapeutics beyond clinical staging.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare, neuroendocrine skin carcinoma that is caused by the Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) in 80% of cases and by ultraviolet (UV) damage in 20% of cases. MCC should theoretically elicit a strong cytotoxic T cell response due to the high neoantigen and viral antigen burden in MCPyV- and MCPyV+ MCC, respectively. However, MCC often escapes immune recognition and is associated with very poor prognosis at advanced stages. To systemically identify mechanisms of immune evasion in MCC, we established 11 robust MCC lines from either primary tumors or patient-derived xenografts (7 MCPyV+ and 4 MCPyV-). We then characterized these tumors and cell lines by whole exome sequencing (WES), RNA-sequencing, scRNA-sequencing, ATAC-seq, and whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS). </p><p>We also studied MCC transcriptional subtypes, utilizing bulk and scRNA-sequencing datasets of patient-derived tumors and cell lines to investigate profiles of neuroendocrine gene expression. The genes linked below define either a neuroendocrine or a non-neuroendocrine phenotype presence within MCC tumors. </p>",

    "description": "<p>Primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphomas (PMBLs) are aggressive tumors that typically present as large mediastinal masses in young women. PMBLs share clinical, transcriptional, and molecular features with classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL), including constitutive activation of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB), JAK/STAT signaling, and programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)-mediated immune evasion. The demonstrated efficacy of PD-1 blockade in relapsed/refractory PMBLs led to recent approval by the US Food and Drug Administration and underscored the importance of characterizing targetable genetic vulnerabilities in this disease. Here, we report a comprehensive analysis of recurrent genetic alterations -somatic mutations, somatic copy number alterations, and structural variants-in a cohort of 37 newly diagnosed PMBLs. We identified a median of 9 genetic drivers per PMBL, including known and newly identified components of the JAK/STAT and NF-kappaB signaling pathways and frequent B2M alterations that limit major histocompatibility complex class I expression, as in cHL. PMBL also exhibited frequent, newly identified driver mutations in ZNF217 and an additional epigenetic modifier, EZH2. The majority of these alterations were clonal, which supports their role as early drivers. In PMBL, we identified several previously uncharacterized molecular features that may increase sensitivity to PD-1 blockade, including high tumor mutational burden, microsatellite instability, and an apolipoprotein B mRNA editing catalytic polypeptide-like (APOBEC) mutational signature. The shared genetic features between PMBL and cHL provide a framework for analyzing the mechanism of action of PD-1 blockade in these related lymphoid malignancies.</p>",

We conducted paired tumor/normal targeted next-generation sequencing of 577 genes in pathways of DNA repair, response to DNA damage, cell-cycle regulation, programmed cell death, MAPK, and P13K/AKT/MTOR signaling in 114 tumors from 71 women. In addition, we investigated single copy number alterations (SCNAs) and loss of heterozygosity in a subset of 61 tumors.

Through GISTIC analysis of the OncoScan data on tumor DNA from 61 cases, we identified several regions of high copy number alterations including including <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4854\" target=\"_blank\">NOTCH3</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5296\" target=\"_blank\">PIK3R2</a> that were significantly associated with an increase in cancer recurrence and a reduction in overall survival.

Recent development of multi-omics and single-cell technologies help us to comprehensively quantify the cellular heterogeneity and spatial organization of the TiME and to further our understanding of antitumor immunity. We investigated the cellular composition of liver cancer patient samples (n=8) using single-cell RNA-seq. For this purpose, mononuclear cells were isolated from human liver cancer samples. Three locations within the tumor-bearing liver were used: adjacent liver, rim and tumor core. Then, cells were FACS sorted (either CD45+ cells or MAIT cells) and subjected to 10X Chromium-based scRNA-seq. We investigated immune cell changes and the cellular heterogeneity of the HCC TiME with a focus on MAIT cells. Annotated H5 files are provided.

    "description": "<p>Colorectal cancer is one of the most lethal cancers worldwide. First-line chemotherapy for metastatic CRC (mCRC) entails a combination of irinotecan with 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin (FOLFIRI). Irinotecan is a prodrug that is converted within the cell to its active metabolite SN38, a potent TOP1 inhibitor. TOP1 relieves DNA torsional strain arising from DNA metabolism by cleaving one strand of the DNA duplex and forming an enzyme-DNA covalent intermediate that can be trapped by inhibitors. The resulting TOP1 DNA-protein crosslinks (TOP1-DPCs) interfere with replication and transcription and induce cell death if left unrepaired. I have established the role of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in TOP1-DPC repair, but it remains unknown how ubiquitylation is activated. One possibility is that collision between advancing replication forks and the DPCs triggers a specific ubiquitin ligase to target DPCs for degradation. The DDB1-CUL4 (Cullin 4)-RBX1 (CRL4) ubiquitin ligase complex performs a salient role in both replication and DNA repair upon its activation by auto-NEDD8 modification (neddylation), but it is unknown whether it plays a role for TOP1-DPC repair. </p><p>We plan to define the role of neddylation for TOP1-DPC repair during replication and examine irinotecan plus pevonedistat (PEV), a NEDD8-activating enzyme inhibitor in multiple clinical trials, in CRC patient-derived preclinical models including 3D organoids. The three in-house organoids, from which samples have been submitted to dbGaP, were sequenced as a means of verifying their identity as colon cancer organoids, to allow us to investigate the combination of TOP1 inhibitors and PEV and the molecular mechanisms underlying this drug combination in these organoids.</p><p> </p>",

To study the malignant transformation of CTCL, we collected matched hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) extracts from bone marrow, CD4+CD26- malignant T cells, CD4+CD26+ normal T cells, and CD34+ HSCs from apheresis performed on 4 patients. To establish the baseline for calling true mutations without using hematopoietic cells, we also cultured bone marrow fibroblasts from each patient to use as normal controls. Whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed on all samples for somatic mutation calling. We identified &gt;200 mutations in CD34+ HSCs derived from either bone marrow or apheresis. Previously reported key oncodrivers in Sezary Syndrome were identified in autologous HSCs and malignant peripheral cells, but not in progenitor (bone marrow HSCs) cells. Also, we identified specific mutations shared by autologous HSCs and malignant peripheral cells in every patient. WES data of bone marrow HSCs, apheresis HSCs, CD4+CD26- T cells, CD4+CD26+ T cells, and fibroblasts will be available through dbGaP.<br></p>",

Among 97 FLs that did not initially receive rituximab-containing therapy, nonsynonymous BCL2 mutations at VAF &gt;20% were associated with shorter, event-free survival (EFS, median 1.4 years with these mutations versus 4.5 years without, p = 0.048), and increased risk of transformation (HR 3.01, 95% CI 1.03-8.77, p = 0.04). Other sequenced genes were less frequently mutated and did not significantly increase the prognostic value of the panel. Across the entire population, BCL2 mutations at VAF &gt;20% were associated with decreased EFS (HR 1.58, 95% CI 1.03-2.40, p = 0.034 after correction for FLIPI and treatment) and decreased overall survival after median 14-year follow-up (HR 1.86, 95% CI 1.07-3.23, p = 0.029). Thus, high VAF BCL2 mutations remain a prognostic factor for FL even in the chemoimmunotherapy era and might need to be considered in future study design.<br></p><p><br></p>",

FFPE lymph nodes from initial diagnosis were reviewed to confirm the presence of FL and estimate tumor content (median 70%, range 50-90%). All participants were contacted every 6 months for the first three years after diagnosis and annually thereafter to determine disease progression/relapse, retreatment, and transformation. All events, as well as deaths (including cause of death) were validated against medical records.<br></p>",

    "description": "<p>A key characteristic of osteosarcoma is extensive and complex genomic rearrangements. However, published models explaining how these genomic rearrangements occur disagree about if these rearrangements occur early in tumor progression and then are stable afterwards, or if there is ongoing genomic instability. Previous studies have employed bulk sequencing technologies to characterize genomic alterations. A limitation of this approach is that it averages all changes within the bulk sample, essentially masking intra-sample heterogeneity and making evaluation of ongoing genomic instability difficult. To overcome this limitation and compliment previous work, we utilized single-cell whole genome sequencing to quantify somatic copy number alterations (SCNA). By interrogating individual cells within a sample, we were able to examine intra-sample heterogeneity. We found that the SCNA patterns between cells within a single sample were remarkably consistent, which supports the concept that the genomes of osteosarcoma tumors are relatively stable after early genome fragmentation events. <br></p>",

The study design addresses two Aims. In Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that treatment with radiation and temozolomide or other therapies leads to consistent genetic changes in human tumors using whole exome sequencing of paired pre- and post-treatment tumor samples to determine large-scale changes in population structures and single cell whole genome sequencing to evaluate the effects of these treatments on microheterogeneity. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that genetic changes identified in post-treatment glioblastomas (GBMs) functionally contribute to various forms of resistance in GBM using patient derived cell lines (PDCL) and patient derived xenografts (PDX). These studies will create a comprehensive understanding of genetic evolution during standard-of-care therapy for GBM. They will inform diagnostic approaches for assignment of targeted therapeutics in the recurrent setting and identify genetic changes driving resistance. Therapeutic targeting of these novel resistance drivers could represent a rational approach to substantially improve our existing standard of care for GBM patients.</p>",

    "description": "<p><b>Background</b>: The primary target of T-cell responses induced against cancer cells are peptides derived from non-synonymous mutations presented by HLA (neoantigens). However, the large diversity of HLA alleles and restricted availability of clinical samples have limited the study of the specificity and the evolution over time of the neoantigen-specific T cell responses induced after treatment with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) immunotherapy. </p><p><b>Methods</b>: We applied a newly developed neoepitope-specific T cell isolation technology to perform a longitudinal landscape analysis of the neoepitope-specific T cells in peripheral blood and tumor from 11 patients with metastatic melanoma; 7 with response and 4 with no response to ICB. Briefly, first using computational prediction, the putative neoantigens in each patient were ranked based on affinity for the patient's HLA and expression levels. Then hundreds of barcoded capture reagents consisting of the patient HLA class I subtypes loaded with the corresponding predicted neoantigen were made and used to isolate neoepitope-specific T cells. Once isolated, the TCRs and the barcodes were sequenced. Finally, the tumor reactivity of the isolated neoepitope-specific TCRs (neoTCRs) was assessed upon co-culture of autologous melanoma cell lines from each patient with primary human T cells expressing the neoTCRs generated using a CRISPR-based non-viral gene editing to replace the endogenous TCRs. </p><p><b>Results</b>: The tumor mutation burden ranged between 3507 and 177 for patients with response to therapy and 977 to 31 for patients without response to therapy. We screened a median of 172 predicted neoantigen-HLA per patient across their 6 HLA molecules and isolated neoTCRs in all 11 patients. The number of mutations targeted ranged between 13 and 1. We assessed the neoTCR-tumor reactivity in samples from 3 patients with response and 3 patients without response. 39 of the 62 neoTCRs demonstrated specific recognition and cytotoxicity to patient-matched melanoma cell lines. Multiple T cell clonotypes recognized a limited number of mutations in 7 patients with response (median of 41 different neoTCR clonotypes per patient), and the T cell specificities were recurrently detected in the blood and the tumor over time. Samples from 4 patients without response to therapy also demonstrated neoepitope-specific T cell responses in blood and tumor to a similarly restricted number of mutations, but lacked TCR polyclonality (median 6.5 neoTCR clonotypes per patient) and were not recurrently detected in sequential samples. </p><p><b>Conclusion</b>: Effective ICB therapy is associated with polyclonal neoepitope-specific T-cell responses in the tumor and blood that recognize a limited number of immunodominant mutations and are recurrently detected over time. </p>",

    "description": "<p>This is a single-institutional, randomized, open label platform clinical trial testing various immunotherapy combinations. Patients with newly diagnosed and surgically resectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) and scheduled to undergo the Whipple procedure at <a href=\"https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/the_johns_hopkins_hospital/\" target=\"_blank\">Johns Hopkins Hospital </a>were eligible to participate in this study. Criteria for determining resectability strictly followed National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines. The study consisted of 6 parts: parts 1-5 constituted the Prime Phase (see below), and part 6 was the Extended Treatment Phase. </p><ul><li>Part 1: Participants received one cycle of immunotherapy two weeks prior to undergoing the Whipple procedure. </li><li>Part 2: Subjects underwent the Whipple procedure. </li><li>Part 3: Subjects received a second cycle of immunotherapy 4-10 weeks following the Whipple procedure (2-4 weeks prior to adjuvant chemoradiation). </li><li>Part 4: Subjects underwent chemoradiation. </li><li>Part 5: Subjects received 4 additional 28-day cycles of immunotherapy beginning 1-2 months after completing chemoradiation for a total of six cycles (two before chemoradiation and 4 following chemoradiation). </li></ul><p>Eligible subjects were randomized to Arms A and B in a 1:1 ratio, stratified up-front by age (&#8804;65, &gt;65). Arm A participants received Cy/GVAX. Arm B participants received the combination of Cy/GVAX and nivolumab. GVAX Vaccine consists of equal numbers (2.5 x 108 each) of Panc 6.03 pcDNA1GM-CSF and Panc 10.05 pcDNA1GM-CSF combined into a single vaccination. Each vaccination consisted of six total intradermal injections. A single intravenous (IV) dose of 200 mg/m<sup>2</sup> Cy (CytoxanR) was given one day prior to GVAX. Anti-PD-1 Therapeutic Antibody Nivolumab 480 mg every 4 weeks was administered as an intravenous infusion. </p><p>The primary objective for Arms A and B was to compare IL17 expression (Th17) in vaccine-induced lymphoid aggregates between resected PDAs from patients treated with the combination of Cy/GVAX and anti-PD-1 blockade antibody vs. the treatment of Cy/GVAX alone. Secondary objectives were to assess the safety, overall survival (OS), and disease free survival (DFS) of patients treated with each of the study drug combinations, and to assess the effects of each of the immunotherapy study drug combinations on PD-L1/PD-1 associated pathways, vaccine-induced immune regulatory signatures, and peripheral and intratumoral antigen specific T cell responses. The exploratory objective was to explore the effects of therapy on tumor and peripheral blood and tumor infiltrating immune cells, and to explore potential molecular determinants of response, progression and disease stability. To these ends, tumor infiltrating immune cells (TIICs) were obtained from surgically resected tumors following the neoadjuvant treatment of the study immunotherapy. TIICs were sorted into CD3+CD4+ T cells, CD3+CD8+ T cells, CD3-CD19+ B cells, and CD3-CD19-CD11b+ myeloid cells by flow cytometry. The sorted immune cell subtype pellets were sent to the commercial vendor (Eurofins) for RNA extraction and sequencing. SMART-seq v4 Ultra Low Input mRNA Sample Prep Kit was used for library preparation with 100bp paired end reads. FASTQ files, that were returned from the vendor, are deposited here. </p>",

    "description": "We performed whole exome sequencing (WES) of paired, macrodissected regions of urothelial carcinoma (UC), not otherwise specified (NOS-UC) and squamous differentiation (SqD) from 21 bladder tumors in which distinct and separable NOS-UC and SqD regions were present (total 42 exomes, in addition to matched normal exomes). Mean tumor mutational burden (TMB) was higher in the SqD versus the NOS-UC regions. Consistent with the higher TMB, the SqD regions also had a higher neoantigen burden than the patient-matched NOS-UC regions. The SqD regions also exhibited higher karyotypic complexity with a higher median ploidy relative to the paired NOS-UC regions. Phylogenetic analysis of the WES data confirmed that the morphologically distinct regions of all 21 tumors arose from a shared precursor with a median of 68 (range 16 &#8211; 852) non-synonymous mutations shared between the NOS-UC and SqD regions, and the overall data were indicative of early branched evolution. As whole exome sequencing did not identify a shared mutational alteration or genomic signature unique to the SqD or NOS-UC components, we therefore performed expression profiling of separable SqD and NOS-UC regions of 12 bladder tumors from the WES cohort with RNA quality sufficient for whole transcriptome RNA-sequencing (RNAseq, total of 24 regions). Based on centroid clustering analysis of expression data, all 12 regions of SqD were basal-squamous subtype based on the TCGA molecular classification schema. Notably, 8 of the NOS-UC regions were also basal-squamous subtype, with only four pairs exhibiting discordant transcriptional subtypes (three NOS-UC regions were luminal-infiltrated, one luminal-papillary). To better quantify differences in the transcriptional profiles of the paired NOS-UC and SqD regions, we used single sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) to assess for enrichment of luminal or basal-squamous gene expression. ssGSEA analysis revealed that the SqD regions expressed higher levels of basal-squamous genes based on the BASE47 gene set and UPK/KRT gene sets; whereas the matched NOS-UC regions expressed higher levels of luminal genes. These differences in the levels of expression of basal and luminal genes were observed even in cases in which both the NOS-UC and SqD regions were basal-squamous subtype based the TCGA molecular classification schema. Exomes from eight patients in this study have previously been deposited in dbGaP: accession number <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap/advanced_search/?TERM=phs001783\" target=\"_blank\">phs001783</a> as part of the study \"Exome Recapture and Sequencing of Prospectively Characterized Clinical Specimens From Cancer Patients\".",

Our cohort included 21 PTs and 22 PDOs. </p><p>In this study, we generated a unique biobank resource of BLCa organoids that encompasses a broad spectrum of disease stages. We demonstrated that PDOs retain cancer heterogeneity and mutational burden. Furthermore, we observed that BLCa PDO can have different morphologies which may reflect tumor-specific features. Indeed, a solid morphology may be associated with more advanced tumors, as supported by the high PDO genomic burden and high primary tumor stage. </p><p>Moreover, with our drug screening pipeline, we demonstrated the clinical relevance and feasibility of using a BLCa PDO-based drug assay for comparing the standard of care (SOC) drugs with compounds not currently in use for BLCa. Response to SOC was highly heterogeneous with approximately 50% of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer and 33% of muscle invasive bladder cancer PDOs showing no or minimal response. The most effective targeted therapy was lapatinib. We used an integrative analysis of drug response profiles with matched PDO genomic analysis to determine enrichment thresholds for candidate markers of therapy resistance and sensitivity. Importantly, by assessing the clinical history of longitudinally sampled cases, the clonal evolution of the disease could be determined and matched with PDO drug response profiles. </p>",

In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), spliceosome mutations leading to aberrant splicing occurs in approximately 20% of patients. However, the underlying mechanism for splicing defects in spliceosome unmutated CLL cases remains elusive. To discover posttranscriptional regulation of RNA splicing, we performed RNA sequencing using RNA derived from B cells from 6 healthy donors and 36 CLL patients, along with MAZTER sequencing from 9 CLL patients (8 matched with RNA sequencing cohort) and B cells from 5 healthy donors. We found that CLL cells have dysregulated m6A modification sites on transcripts from splicing factors, suggesting a critical role of m6A modification in RNA splicing dysregulation.</p>",

Epidemiologic studies have identified common risk factors for MDS and AML, including smoking, chemical exposures, and previous treatment with chemotherapy and radiation.  Analyses of the role of common germline genetic variation in MDS and AML have been limited to date. Our study used data from population-based case-control studies of MDS and AML in Minnesota to evaluate genetic contributions to disease. Cases were enrolled through rapid case ascertainment from the Minnesota Cancer Reporting System, a registry that collects information on all cancers diagnosed in Minnesota.  Minnesota State driver&#39;s license/identification lists were used to identify controls.  Medical record review was completed for cases and centralized review was conducted for diagnosis confirmation and MDS subtype verification.

    "description": "Our study aimed to define the extent of heterogeneity between anatomically separated tumor manifestations in follicular lymphoma at single-cell resolution. We subjected single-cell suspensions derived from nodal, synchronously-acquired fine needle aspirations from two distinct tumor sites to high-throughput microfluidics-based single-cell RNA sequencing. By comparing the relative composition of the tumor subpopulations between the two tumor sites, we found that some patients can exhibit site-to-site differences. While the overall composition of the tumor microenvironment did not differ significantly between sites, we did detect a specific correlation between site-to-site tumor heterogeneity and T follicular helper cell abundance. Our study demonstrates the significant limitations of a solitary biopsy in defining the full scope of a patient's disease.",

We measured 82 blood-based immune-oncology markers, and\n genotyped the participants using the HumanOmni5-Quad BeadChip, which provides a significant genome \ncoverage for genetically-admixed and diverse populations, to evaluate the genetic basis and evidence for \ncausality of any immune-inflammation marker that is associated with prostate cancer risk.

    "description": "<p>Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I and HLA class II loci are essential elements of innate and acquired immunity. Their exceptional influence on disease outcome is well documented by GWAS and candidate gene studies. The impact of HLA allelic variation on human disease through allele-specific presentation of antigenic peptides to T cells has been the main focus to determine HLA effects on disease susceptibility/pathogenesis. However, HLA expression levels have also been implicated in disease, adding another dimension to the extreme diversity of HLA that impacts variability in immune responses across individuals. HLA expression levels routinely rely on quantitative PCR (qPCR). An alternative is adoption of high throughput technologies such as RNA-Seq. This provides the opportunity to quantify HLA expression in large datasets, but also allows comparison between RNA-Seq and qPCR. In this study, we analyze expression data for HLA Class I genes for a matched set of individuals (N = 96) by RNA-Seq, qPCR and cell surface expression. Samples were obtained from the Research Donor Program (NCI-Frederick). We observed a moderate correlation between RNA-Seq and qPCR. We suggest technical and biological factors that might contribute to differences in the techniques. </p>",

    "description": "<p>Calcitonin-producing pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (CT-pNENs), which can mimic clinical and laboratory features of medullary thyroid carcinoma, are an extremely rare clinical entity with approximately 60 cases reported worldwide. The molecular profile of CT-pNENs is not yet known. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed on tumor and corresponding serum samples of five patients with increased calcitonin serum levels and histologically proven calcitonin-positive CT-pNENs. cBioPortal analysis and gene enrichment analysis with DAVID were performed to validate candidate genes. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect protein expression of MUC4 and MUC16 in CT-pNEN specimens. Common somatic mutations of pNENs like MEN1, ATRX and PIK3CA were identified in cases of CT-pNENs. New somatic SNVs in ATP4A, HES4, and CAV3 have not yet been described in CT-pNENs. Pathogenic germline mutations in FGFR4 and DPYD were found in three of five cases. Mutations of CALCA (calcitonin) and the corresponding receptor CALCAR were found in all five tumor samples, but none of them resulted in clinical or protein sequelae. All five tumor cases showed single nucleotide variations (SNVs) in MUC4, and four cases showed SNVs in MUC16, both of which were membrane-bound mucins. Immunohistochemistry showed protein expression of MUC4 and MUC16 in one case each, and the liver metastasis of a third case was double positive for MUC4 and MUC16. The homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) score of all tumors was low.</p><p>CT-pNENs have a unique molecular signature compared to other pNEN subtypes, specifically involving the FGFR4, DPYD, MUC4, MUC16 and the KRT family genes. However, these WES data from only five cases must be interpreted with caution because causal interpretation of the mutational landscape in CT-pNENs is difficult. Further research is needed to explain differences in pathogenesis compared with other pNENs. In particular, multi-omics data such as RNASeq, methylation, and whole genome sequencing could be informative.</p>",

Lung cancer cases were recruited in three main hospitals of Asturias, following an identical protocol from 2002 to 2012. Eligible cases were incident cases of histologically confirmed lung cancer between 30 and 85 years of age and residents in the geographical area of each participating hospital. Controls were selected from patients admitted to those hospitals with diagnoses unrelated to the exposures of interest and individually matched by ethnicity, gender, age (&#177; 5 years) and hospital. Epidemiologic data were collected personally through computer-assisted questionnaires by trained interviewers during the first hospital admission. Structured questionnaires collected information on sociodemographic characteristics, recent and prior tobacco use, environmental exposure (air pollution and passive smoking), diet, personal and family history of cancer, and occupational history from each participant.

Participants were administered a LDCT scan along with a standard study questionnaire at baseline. Blood samples were systematically collected at baseline since 2006. Participants who had an abnormality in a CT scan were followed up every 1 to 2 years. The screening program was organized by the Princess Margaret Hospital. <b>PanCan:</b> Ever smokers between the ages of 50-75 with no previous history of invasive cancer are eligible to participate in the study. The study was carried out across Canada in Vancouver, Calgary, Hamilton, Toronto, Ottawa, Quebec, Halifax, and St. John's. A total of 2537 smokers have been screened from 2008 to 2011. All study participants completed a detailed questionnaire, spirometry, collection of blood specimens for biomarker measurement and LDCT at baseline. All participants are followed for a minimum of 3 years. On yearly follow up, an updated shorter questionnaire is administered, blood is collected and CT scans are performed. Blood samples are available from all 2537 individuals. <b>BCCA Screening Program:</b> From 1990 to 2007, 4274 smokers above 40 years old who had smoked 20 pack-years or more were enrolled at BCCA. Upon enrollment, subjects completed a questionnaire for their lifestyle and medical history. Baseline spirometry was conducted using a flow-sensitive spirometer in accordance with the American Thoracic Society recommendations. Since 2000, a LDCT was obtained in 2440 individuals. The participants were followed prospectively to determine whether they developed lung cancer. A total of 9759 individuals participated in the CT screening program in Canada from these 3 programs.

CARET began in 1985, and the intervention was halted in January 1996, 21 months ahead of schedule, with the twin conclusions for definitive evidence of no benefit and substantial evidence of a harmful effect of the intervention on both lung cancer incidence and total mortality. CARET continued to follow and collect endpoints on their participants through 2005. Pathology reports and medical records were reviewed to confirm cancer endpoints, and death certificates obtained to capture cause of death. During the active intervention phase of CARET, serum, plasma, whole blood, and lung tissue specimens were collected on participants. These biospecimens make up the CARET Biorepository. For the OncoArray Project, CARET provided DNA extracted from whole blood of lung cancer cases and controls matched on age at baseline (&#177; 4 years), sex, race, baseline smoking status, history of occupational asbestos exposure (asbestos vs heavy smoker), and year of enrollment (2-year intervals).</p> <p><b>The </b><a href=\"https://epic.iarc.fr/\" target=\"_blank\"><b>European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)</b> </a><b></b>study is a multi-center cohort study involving 521,000 study participants from 10 European countries.

Details of the study were described previously. Briefly, eligible cases included any person over the age of 18 years with a diagnosis of primary lung cancer that was further confirmed by an MGH lung pathologist. Controls were recruited from the friends or spouses of cancer patients or the friends or spouses of other surgery patients in the same hospital. Potential controls were excluded from participation if they had a diagnosis of any cancer (other than non-melanoma skin cancer). Interviewer-administered questionnaires, a modified version of the standardized American Thoracic Society respiratory questionnaire, collected information on demographics, medical history, family history of cancer, smoking history, and a detailed work history, including job titles and tasks.

The cohort was assembled in 1993-1996 by mailing a self-administered questionnaire to persons identified primarily through driver's license files. The baseline questionnaire obtained information on demographics, anthropometry, smoking history, medical and reproductive histories, family history of cancer, diet and physical activity. Incident cancer cases are identified by regular linkage with the State of California Cancer Registry and the Hawaii Tumor Registry, both members of the SEER Program of the NCI. In 2001-2006, a prospective biorepository was assembled by collecting a pre-diagnostic blood specimen from 67,594 surviving MEC members. At the time of blood collection a short questionnaire was administered that included information on smoking during the previous 15 days. For this study, cases were all lung cancer cases incident to blood draw and diagnosed before December 2012.

The patients were enrolled in the study, whenever practically feasible among patients admitted for lung cancer at the <a href=\"https://helse-bergen.no/en/steder/haukeland\" target=\"_blank\">Haukeland University Hospital </a>in Bergen, Norway. The informed written consents covering analysis of molecular and genetic markers was signed by the patients prior to surgery. Only patients with histologically confirmed early-stage NSCLC were included in our study. The subjects included in this project are a subgroup recruited into the project \"lung cancer genetics\" at NIOH. The controls were recruited from the same geographical region of Western Norway and frequency-matched with cases on cumulative smoking dose (pack-years). Pack-years smoked [( 20 cigarettes per day) x years smoked] were calculated to indicate the cumulative smoking dose. The Cases and controls were interviewed using similar questionnaires and were categorized as never smokers, ex-smokers or current smokers. Never smokers are subjects indicating having smoked less than 100 cigarettes in their life time. Ex-smokers were defined as those having quitted at least 1 year before sampling, and current smokers were those indicating that they were smokers at the time of sampling.

Screening for lung cancer among participants in the intervention arm included a chest x-ray at baseline followed by either three annual x-rays (for current or former smokers at enrollment) or two annual x-rays (for never smokers); participants in the control arm received routine health care. Screening-arm participants provided data on sociodemographic factors, smoking behavior, anthropometric characteristics, medical history, and family history of cancer, as well as blood samples annually for the first 6 years of the study (baseline T0 and T1 through T5). Lung cancers were ascertained through annual questionnaires mailed to the participants, and positive reports were followed up by abstracting medical records or death certificates. Follow-up in the trial as of July 2009 was 96.7%. Patients were excluded because of missing baseline questionnaire, previous history of any cancer, diagnosis of multiple cancers during follow-up, missing smoking information at baseline, missing consent for utilization of biologic specimens for etiologic studies, or unavailability/insufficient quantity of serum or DNA specimens.</p> <p><b>The Resource for the Study of Lung Cancer Epidemiology in North Trent (<a href=\"https://resolucent.sites.sheffield.ac.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">ReSoLuCENT</a>) </b>is an ongoing study conducted in Sheffield from 2006 and due to complete recruitment in 2016. The study recruited pathologically confirmed lung cancer cases diagnosed at age 60 years or younger and family matched controls. Lung cancer cases diagnosed at ages older than 60 years were recruited if they reported a family history of lung cancer. The cases and matched controls were recruited through several major cancer treatment centers, however, the majority were recruited in North Trent. All participants completed a detailed lifestyle questionnaire which included questions about occupational exposures, education, medical history and family history of cancer and lung disease. Participants also donated blood samples for DNA extraction. The ReSoLuCENT study has been funded by the Sheffield Hospitals Charity, Sheffield ECMC and Weston Park Hospital Cancer Charity.

Detailed epidemiological and clinical data is collected with associated specimens (i.e. tumor tissue, blood, plasma, sputum, bronchial lavage and oral brushings). The participants have completed a detailed lifestyle questionnaire at recruitment, with repeat questionnaires at intervals; updated data on clinical outcome and hospital events are collected through the Health and Social Care Information Center (including Office of National Statistics mortality data, Cancer Registry and Health Episode Statistics). The project is registered on the UK National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) lung cancer portfolio and has all the required ethical approvals and sponsorship arrangements in place. The lung tumors were reviewed by the reference pathologist.</p> <p><b>The Seoul Bundang Lung Cancer Study</b> was conducted between 2005 and 2010 to discover genetic and environmental factors related with lung cancer development. Lung cancer cases were recruited at the Seoul National University Hospital in Bundang. Controls were selected randomly from individuals participated in health check-up program and were frequency matched with cases on age and sex. All subjects were interviewed, and information on lifestyle risk factors, occupational history and medical and family history was collected using a standard questionnaire. Tumors were reviewed by the pathologists in the hospital. If the reviews conflicted, a consensus was arrived at after discussion. Coding of histology was based on 2001 WHO/IASLC. Genomic DNA was extracted based on standard protocol.</p> <p><b>The Shanghai Cohort Study (SCS)</b> consisted of 18,244 men in Shanghai, China, who were 45-64 years old at the time of enrollment during 1986-1989. Approximately 80% of eligible men participated in the study. At the time of recruitment, each cohort subject was interviewed in-person by a trained nurse interviewer using a structured questionnaire that included background information, history of tobacco and alcohol use, current diet, and medical history. At the completion of the interview, the nurse collected a 10 ml blood and a single void urine specimen from the study participant. The buccal cell samples were collected from all surviving cohort members (~15,000) in the 2001-2002 follow-up interviews. The cohort has been followed for the occurrence of cancer and death through routine ascertainment of new cases from the population-based Shanghai Cancer Registry and Shanghai Vital Statistics Units. To maximize the cancer findings and minimize the loss of follow-up, we contacted each surviving cohort member annually. Retired nurses visit the last known address of each living cohort member and record details of the interim health history of the cohort member. As of December 31, 2014, cumulatively 612 (3.4%) original subjects were lost to follow-up, and 574 (3.1%) refused to our continued follow-up interview. </p> <p>A nested case-control study of incident lung cancer cases within the Shanghai Cohort Study was used to examine the association between serum levels of vitamin B6 and other compounds in the one-carbon metabolism pathway and risk of lung cancer. Briefly, 516 lung cancer cases were identified among cohort participants with available serum samples as of 12/31/2006. For each case, we randomly selected one control subject from all cohort members who were free of cancer and alive at the time of cancer diagnosis of the index case. Controls were matched to the index case by age at enrollment (&#177;2 years), date of biospecimen collection (&#177;1 month) and neighborhood of residence at recruitment, and smoking status (current, former and never smokers) as established previously for other studies. For former smokers, cases and controls were further matched by years since quitting smoking (&lt;10 vs &#8805;10 years). One serum vial per subject was retrieved from biorepository and all serum samples were sent to the laboratory (B-vital) for measurements. DNA samples of 250 lung cancer cases and 250 matched controls were available for the present study.</p> <p><b><a href=\"https://www.schs.pitt.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">The Singapore Chinese Health Study (SCHS)</a></b> cohort consisted of 63,257 Chinese men and women in Singapore when they were 45-74 years old at the time of enrollment between April 1993 and December 1998. At recruitment, each study subject was interviewed in person by a trained interviewer using a structured questionnaire that emphasized current diet assessed via a validated, 165-item food frequency questionnaire. The questionnaire also requested information on demographics, lifetime use of tobacco, incense use, current physical activity, usual sleep duration, reproductive history (women only), occupational exposure, medical history, and family history of cancer. Blood or buccal cell, and spot urine samples were collected first from a random 3% sample of cohort participants in April 1994, and extended to all surviving cohort participants starting in January 2000. Overall approximately 60% of eligible cohort participants donated biospecimens. The cohort has been passively followed for death and cancer occurrence through regular record linkage with the population-based Singapore Cancer Registry and the Singapore Registry of Births and Deaths. Migration out of Singapore, especially among housing estate residents, was negligible. As of latest update, only 55 individuals from this cohort were known to be lost to follow-up due to migration and other reason.</p> <p>A nested case-control study of incident lung cancer cases within the Singapore Chinese Health Study was used to examine the association between serum levels of vitamin B6 and other compounds in the one-carbon metabolism pathway and risk of lung cancer. As of 12/31/2011, 422 lung cancer cases were identified among cohort participants with available prediagnostic plasma samples. For each case, one control subject was randomly selected from all eligible cohort members who were alive and free of cancer on the date of cancer diagnosis of the index case. The control subject was individually matched to the index case by gender, dialect group (Hokkien, Cantonese), age at enrollment (&#177;3 years), date of baseline interview (&#177;2 year), date of biospecimen collection (&#177;6 months), and smoking status (current, former, and never smokers). For current smokers, cases and controls were further matched by number of cigarettes per day (&lt;15, &#8805;15 cigarettes/day). For former smokers, cases and controls were further matched by years since quitting smoking (&lt;10, &#8805;10 years).

    "description": "<p>Progress in the early detection and treatment of cancer requires accurate model systems to further evaluate new, promising discoveries. Small animal and, in particular, mouse model systems are attractive to researchers for numerous reasons, including their ease of use and well-described platforms. </p><p>The ability to grow human tumors in immune-deficient mice (so-called patient-derived xenografts, or PDXs) allows researchers to work directly with human cancer tissue in a controlled setting. However, PDX models are limited by their lack of an intact immune system. Immunotherapy has revolutionized clinical oncology, but lacks pre-clinical models of the human immune system and human cancer to investigate new modalities and limitations/toxicities of treatment regimens. The broad objective of this study is to validate an in vivo model to evaluate human tumors in the context of a complete and intact human immune system in a completely personalized and autologous fashion to study cancer immunotherapy. Herein, we will: (1) validate the ability of our humanized system to serve as a model for cancer immunotherapy treatment response and toxicity in patients with melanoma, including immunotherapy checkpoint blockade and vaccine strategies, and (2) extend our current work in melanoma by validating the ability to establish humanized mice and evaluate tumor growth and leukocyte development in autologous human pancreatic and colorectal tumors established in humanized mice. In each of these areas, we will leverage our multi-institutional team's individual expertise along with our institutional infrastructure to maximize the success of the experimental aims. The results from this project will be widely available to the general research community for future, hypothesis-driven research. Taken together, our study will meet multiple goals and address several unmet needs in cancer immunotherapy, thus significantly enhancing the applicability of a fully autologous and immunocompetent precision model system for use in translational oncology research. </p>",

    "description": "<p>As molecular medicine wields greater and greater influence on cancer patient care, including therapeutic selection, it becomes increasingly important to understand the power and deficiencies of computational tools used in decision making processes. Here we use a set of unselected metastatic colorectal tumor samples in a head-to-head comparison between the calculation of stromal content by a board certified pathologist, versus that derived from whole exome sequencing and purity assessment by a variety of common computational methods. We find that in about one half of samples the computational methods each do a poor job of assessing the percent stromal contamination, and as a result, tumor variant allele frequencies (VAFs) are low or undetected, whereas analysis of organoids derived from the same tumors yielded much higher VAFs in keeping with their lower stromal content. The whole exome sequence of our samples is available via dbGaP, accession phs003059.v1.p1.</p>",

Our group analyzed 216 blood samples from 38 CLL patients at multiple time points during their BTKi treatment. Samples were prepared by standard protocols and sequenced using 200x Illumina sequencing. Using the longitudinal data, we reconstructed the clonal evolution of each patient using somatic mutations found within the B-cell populations. Three patterns of clonal evolution were identified: 1) new clone emergence, 2) clonal selection, and 3) clonal replacement. As previously seen in ibrutinib treatment, the evolution of subclones containing CLL-driver mutations was associated with worse clinical outcomes for patients treated with acalabrutinib (Log-rank p=0.04). Understanding clonal evolution during treatment with acalabrutinib can help determine and modify the clinical course of patients with CLL. </p>",

Using multiplexed FISH analysis of 3-4 tumor cores from 17 glioblastoma formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumors, we identified two classes of tumors based on single cell co-occurrence of EGFR and CDK4 amplification. Tumors with a low odds ratio for finding EGFR and CDK4 amplified in the same cell (ORlow tumors) had higher EGFR copy number and higher diversity of copy number in cells harboring EGFR amplification. This suggested that in ORlow tumors EGFR is likely present on extrachromosomal DNA. To test this hypothesis, we performed whole genome sequencing on DNA extracted from FFPE slides from 3 ORlow samples and 3 ORhigh samples and used AmpliconArchitect to investigate the structure of the EGFR amplicon. We found multiple breakpoints and high complexity structure in the 3 tested ORlow samples, but not in the ORhigh samples, supporting the possibility of an extrachromosomal nature of EGFR amplification in the first group.</p>",

To determine the effect of PI3K delta inhibition on glucocorticoid-induced gene regulation, B-lymphoblastic leukemia cells were treated with glucocorticoids +/- the PI3K delta inhibitor, idelalisib, for 24 hours prior to RNA extraction and sequencing. Biological replicates were performed for 4 of the 7 subjects; 2 of these subjects had specimens demonstrating an additive response to the combination of glucocorticoids and idelalisib in viability testing in vitro, and 2 subjects' specimens demonstrated a synergistic response. All 7 subjects were analyzed together and the 4 specimens with biological replicates were also evaluated in an additional analysis. An average of 40 million reads per specimen and treatment condition were obtained. We compared gene expression in each treatment condition to vehicle-treated cells and expression in glucocorticoid or idelalisib only treated cells to combination treated cells. Using a high dose of dexamethasone (25 or 50 nM) and an equivalent dose of prednisolone, we found that the addition of idelalisib (500 nM) enhanced prednisolone-induced gene regulation but not dexamethasone-induced gene regulation. Surprisingly, the specimens with additive response to combination therapy demonstrated enhancement of prednisolone-induced gene regulation with the addition of idelalisib, while the specimens with synergistic responses did not. Raw sequencing data (FASTQ) and count tables will be available through dbGaP. </p>",

In this study, we enumerated circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from patients with precursor and overt diseases, and developed a novel approach, MinimuMM-seq, which enables detection of translocations and copy number abnormalities through whole-genome sequencing of highly pure CTCs. In a cohort of 51 patients, 24 with paired BM, we applied our method MinimuMM-seq and detected 100% of clinically reported BM biopsy events. The next-generation sequencing (NGS) assay could replace molecular cytogenetics by Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) for diagnostic yield and risk classification. In 8 patients we could apply MinimuMM-seq on serially collected samples to track and monitor major clones in peripheral blood. We describe clonal evolution and shifting dynamics of subclones over time, as well as in between blood and marrow compartments. All whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data generated in this study will be made accessible through dbGaP.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Overall the outcomes of patients with metastatic melanoma have improved dramatically over the last decade due to an improved understanding of the molecular drivers of this disease. In particular, multiple targeted therapy regimens have been approved for patients with a BRAFV600E/K mutation, which are present in ~50% of cutaneous melanomas. These treatments achieve clinical responses in ~80% of patients with a BRAFV600E/K mutation, thus providing proof-of-concept of the therapeutic potential for personalized therapeutic strategies. However, most of the patients will progress within 2 years of starting those therapies. Further, currently there are no targeted therapies that have been shown to be effective in patients with a wild-type <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/673\" target=\"_blank\">BRAF</a>. Thus, there are unmet clinical needs to develop treatments that prevent or overcome resistance to existing therapies for patients with a BRAFV600E/K mutation, and that are effective in patients without a BRAF mutation. In order to facilitate the development of new therapeutic strategies, over the last 5 years we have led a major effort to develop a broad collection of PDX models to reflect the clinical, histological, and genetic heterogeneity of this disease. Our collection of PDX models represents one of the largest collections for any human malignancy, and our initial testing demonstrates that the collection accurately recapitulates the oncogenic drivers and molecular heterogeneity that is observed in patients. This collection also includes a subset of PDX established from patients with acquired resistance to targeted therapies that have been maintained on those agents in vivo to sustain their resistant phenotype. Together these efforts have generated a robust resource to develop, refine, and prioritize new personalized combinatorial therapies for patients. Thus, we propose to establish a multi-disciplinary and multi-institutional PDTC Program focused on the use and continued expansion of our robust melanoma PDX collection to identify new therapeutic approaches that fill important clinical gaps in this disease.<br></p>",

The screening component of the trial was completed in 2006. However, participants have been under follow-up for cancer incidence and mortality since that time. In addition, PLCO included a large biological sample biorepository which has served as a unique resource for cancer research, particularly for etiologic and early-marker studies. As part of these efforts, PLCO has been used for a large number of genome-wide association and exome sequencing studies for different types of cancer.</p>",
    "history": "<p>Much of the data from these studies has been published and posted to dbGAP in the past. However, such data was posted as part of published projects that nearly always included PLCO data that was intermixed with other studies. Furthermore, the PLCO data from each of these studies was genotyped across a range of Illumina genotyping platforms. Thus, prior to this posting, it has been impossible to use all of the data from PLCO as one cohesive unit.</p>",
    "inclusion_criteria": "<p>Here, we are posting a harmonized and imputed dataset of PLCO GWAS and exome data, consisting of all harmonizable PLCO genotype data from each completed scan of cancer cases and controls, as well as the key covariates of sex and participant ID. As PLCO is a prospective cohort, incident cancers and other diseases are occurring all of the time. It is therefore important that researchers use contemporary follow-up in order to precisely define cancer case/control status. Therefore, to use this data, researchers should obtain the genetic data from dbgap and in parallel obtain up-to-date data on cancer and other diseases through the PLCO Cancer Data Access System (CDAS): http://prevention.cancer.gov/major-programs/prostate-lung-colorectal/cancer-data-access-system. Also available in CDAS are a large variety of covariate and endpoints as well as published biomarker data, which can be used for both main-effect and gene x environment studies. Together, we believe that these data will serve as a helpful resource for the entire scientific community.</p> <p>This PLCO dataset contains data genotyped on Illumina GSA, Oncoarray and historical data on Illumina OmniExpress (OmniX), Omni2.5M (Omni25) and Omni5M (Omni5). Most of the platforms used in PLCO were run separately, processed and QCed at different times. GSA data was generated at CGR within a relatively short period.  Oncoarray data was genotyped at CGR and multiple external Institutes. OmniX, Omni25 and Omni5M data was genotyped at CGR historically. Genotype data from OmniX and Omni25M was generated with different clustering files.  \r</p><p>All genotype data was prepared in the binary PLINK file format.

Chip data generated within CGR have had internal QC measures (iterative 80% and 95% sample- and variant-level call rate filters) applied, but not more stringent pre-imputation MAF and HWE filtering; external data have inconsistent QC due to provenance. Samples present in multiple genotyping datasets are released in all applicable datasets with the same synchronized PLCO ID.\r</p><p>All subjects were split and cleaned by GRAF ancestry (see below) before imputation. More specifically, imputed data from each platform was split into 7 ancestral groups (African+African American, East Asian+Other Asian, European, Hispanic1, Hispanic2, Other, South Asian) based on ancestry assignment using GRAF (https://github.com/ncbi/graf).\r</p><p>TOPMED reference panel 5b was used for imputation with Michigan Imputation Server (https://imputationserver.sph.umich.edu). Pre-phasing using phased reference data from TOPMed release 5b was conducted using EAGLE 2.4 (doi: 10.1038/ng.3679). Imputation was conducted against the same reference panel using minimac4 (https://genome.sph.umich.edu/wiki/Minimac4).  Due to the limitation of sample size allowed by Michigan Imputation Server, the GSA/European dataset was imputed by splitting to 4 different batches. \r</p><p>Each platform/ancestry pair was cleaned according to the filtering method in https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1008500. Briefly, all variants with Rsq &lt; 0.3 are removed to be consistent with traditional quality filters on MACH-style output. Then, the remaining variants are partitioned into minor allele frequency (MAF) bins {[0,0.0005], (0.0005,0.002], (0.002,0.005], (0.005,0.01], (0.01,0.03], (0.03,0.05], (0.05, 0.5]}. Variants in each bin are filtered out, starting at the lowest Rsq, until the average Rsq of remaining variants within the corresponding MAF bin is at least 0.9 (the Kowalski et al. citation suggests 0.8; the use of a more stringent threshold has no impact on common variation).</p>",

We observe that tumors can be broadly categorized into intra-tumoral heterogeneity (ITH) high and low, which correlates across genomic, transcriptomic, immune and tumor microenvironment (TME) landscapes. We identify several genetic alterations associated with ITH that correlate with a myeloid high and effector T cell low TME. Namely, ITH high tumors are enriched for mutations in SETD2, PBRM1, CDKN2A/B somatic copy number loss and HLA loss of heterozygosity, and they demonstrate the characteristics of immune escape. ITH high tumors demonstrate reduced peripheral blood TCR diversity which is associated with neoantigen depletion. Moreover, we identify a link between neoantigen depletion and immune escape through myeloid activation. A transcriptomic signature associated with neoantigen depletion is strongly associated with response to ICI treatment and targeted therapies in several independent clinical trial cohorts.</p>",

    "description": "<p>This study focused on the identification of genomic signatures present in tumors from Fanconi anemia patients. Fanconi anemia is a rare hereditary disease caused by defects in DNA interstrand crosslink repair. The primary patient phenotypes are bone marrow failure and cancer predisposition. We concentrated on squamous cell carcinomas and used whole genome Illumina sequencing (22 tumor samples and 12 normal samples) , whole exome sequencing (37 tumor samples and 33 normal samples), PacBio long-read whole-genome (nine tumor and four normal samples),10X linked-read whole-genome sequencing, 10x single-cell/nuclei 3&#39; RNA sequencing (three tumor samples), 10x Visium spatial transcriptomics (one tumor sample), EPIC 850K methylation array (six samples), and bulk RNAseq (six tumor samples) to identify somatic changes present in tumors. \n</p><p>The study aimed to identify changes that drive tumorigenesis in Fanconi anemia, give insight into the early development and aggressive nature of these tumors, and suggest therapeutic avenues for these patients. Another goal was to compare the genomic changes identified in tumors from Fanconi anemia patients with sporadic head and neck cancers. \n</p><p>This study demonstrated that the tumors from Fanconi anemia individuals are generally not driven by HPV. Instead, they acquire mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor. The main characteristic of the tumors is the presence of a high number of structural variants in the form of small deletions, unbalanced translocations, and fold-back inversions, which often form complex rearrangements. These rearrangements result in amplifications and deletions of a multitude of oncogenes and tumor suppressors, respectively. The study also shows that lack of the Fanconi anemia DNA repair pathway leads to an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in a mouse model and in human samples that may influence the behavior of tumors in Fanconi anemia. Finally, comparing genomic changes in Fanconi anemia and sporadic tumors of the head and neck, we propose that the structural variants present in sporadic cancer result in a functional deficiency of the Fanconi anemia DNA repair pathway. \n</p>",
    "history": "<p>The International Fanconi Anemia Registry (IFAR) has been active since 1982 when Dr. Auerbach and Dr. Shroeder started it to identify and describe the phenotypic heterogeneity of individuals with Fanconi anemia. In 2003, Kutler DI et al., based on the data from the registry, reported that Fanconi anemia patients had a 700-fold increased risk of developing head and neck cancer. In 2011, Dr. Smogorzewska became the principal investigator of the registry. After initially identifying causative genes mutated in Fanconi anemia individuals, she focused on gathering tumor samples for the present study. The registry gathered fresh and archival material for the study through collaboration with multiple physicians and working with the enrolled individuals and their families. The normal/germline samples in the form of blood and fibroblast cultures were gathered in parallel or were already available through the registry. The Fanconi Anemia Research Fund has been fundamental in identifying individuals eligible for this study.   </p>",

    "description": "<p>African Americans (AA) suffer from the highest rates of Prostate Cancer (CaP) in the world, but while men of African descent around the world suffer disproportionately from CaP compared to men of other races or ethnicities, our understanding of the reasons for these disparities remains incomplete. To date, few exposure, lifestyle, or environmental influences have been identified in CaP etiology. In contrast, CaP is among the most heritable of common cancers, and over 290 susceptibility loci have been identified. However, many of these loci have not been replicated in AA, in part because of limited African descent sample sizes, incomplete capture of African alleles, and a limited understanding of African genomic architecture. To better understand the etiology of CaP in African descent men, we established a large, multicenter consortium known as &#8220;Men of African Descent and Carcinoma of the Prostate&#8221; (MADCaP). Using resources of this consortium, we have undertaken a multicenter study of CaP in Sub-Saharan Africa, enrolling CaP cases from 7 institutions in 4 countries in Africa (Nigeria, Senegal, Ghana, and South Africa) and age matched controls from the same institutions. We designed a novel genotyping array, in partnership with Thermo Fisher Scientific, leveraging its Applied BiosystemTM AxiomTM Genotyping solution, to provide good coverage of African genomic variation, as well as incorporating cancer loci, with the goal of being able to fine-map existing prostate cancer loci, as well as mapping novel loci.

This is particularly true for rare cancers where sufficient numbers of patients may simply not be available for appropriate statistically powered studies.</p> <p>In this project we have explored a study design based around the concept of \"two-hit mapping\" using the co-occurrence of germ-line and somatic mutations in the same gene to assist in the identification of susceptibility genes. The dataset includes 54 kidney cancer patients selected for enrichment of genetic disease, that is patients with: early age of onset and/or family history and/or bilateral disease. Germ-line and somatic (kidney cancer) tumor sequencing was carried out. These data may improve our understanding of kidney cancer.</p>",

The present study sought to identify molecular predictors of LTS for women with HGSC. A cohort of 24 frozen HGSC samples (12 LTS and 12 STS) were collected and analyzed at DNA and RNA levels. Copy number variation and mutation did not indicate large differences between LTS and STS. From RNA-Seq analysis, 11 genes were found to be differentially expressed between the STS and LTS groups (fold change &gt;2; false discovery rate &lt;0.01). In the validation cohort, transmembrane protein 62 (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/80021\" target=\"_blank\">TMEM62</a>) was found to be related to LTS.

In this study we discuss the clinical implications and consequences of molecular heterogeneity in a metastatic breast cancer patient identified through serial biopsies, multi-omic analysis, and longitudinal patient monitoring, performed through the precision oncology program, Serial Measurements of Molecular and Architectural Responses to Therapy (SMMART). This case study describes a metastatic breast cancer patient with a highly heterogenous tumor that began as ER positive/HER2 negative on diagnosis, then was found to be ER negative/HER2 positive in a metastatic liver lesion (Study biopsy #1), and finally triple negative (TNBC) in another metastatic liver biopsy (Study biopsy #2). Multi-omic assays included clinical genomic panel sequencing, clinical immunohistochemistry, a clinical protein profiling assay (Intracellular Signaling Protein Profiling), RNA sequencing, and RPPA. Here we provide the expression data from RNAseq and RPPA data on Study biopsy #2 for the patient discussed in this case report.

    "description": "<p>This project is a multi-omics study of high grade (grade 3) neuroendocrine neoplasms across diverse organs. Genomic analysis using low-pass whole genome sequencing for copy number analysis, whole exome sequencing and whole transcriptomic sequencing using RNAseq were performed. As high grade neuroendocrine neoplasms are highly lethal with a median survival of approximately 7 months, new insights are urgently needed for better prognosis, diagnosis and management. This study focuses on gene and pathway discoveries in this cancer, and includes samples from a diverse set of organs, including the lungs, gastroenteropancreatic tract, breast, prostate, head and neck and bladder. This study was made possible by a generous donation from The Helen B. Rodde Fund.</p>",
    "history": "<p>Neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs) are rare epithelial cancers with neuroendocrine differentiation. Clinically, NENs are treated based on pathologic grading, with the highest being grade 3 NENs which are the most aggressive, bearing a median survival of only 7 months and a 5-year overall survival as low as 5%. As NENs are rare - accounting for only 0.5% of all newly diagnosed malignancies-grade 3 NENs are even more so, thus severely constraining our ability to understand their tumor biology and to create effective treatment.</p> <p>While grade 3 NENs arise most commonly from the gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) and the pulmonary systems, they can also originate from other diverse organ systems including genitourinary, head and neck, gynecologic and breast. A central question facing the field is whether these tumors, despite originating from different organs, are the same entity (given similar appearance on histology) or different. Without a deeper understanding, the current clinical approach is to treat all grade 3 NENs with the same chemotherapy (platinum and etoposide), which unfortunately prolongs survival by only a few months. To date, no whole exomic or genomic studies have been conducted on these tumors. Prior studies have been limited to grade 1 and 2 NENs in the pancreas. Published studies on G3 NENs have been restricted to selected cancer genes analyzed with immunohistochemistry or targeted sequencing panels.</p> <p>This study interrogates the genomic landscape of G3 NENs in an unbiased manner using a comprehensive integrated multi-omics approach that includes somatic copy number alteration (SCNA), whole exome (WES) and whole transcriptome analysis. This dataset allows for the identification of mutations, driver genes and dysregulated signaling pathways that could present diagnostic and therapeutic opportunities for these tumors.</p>",
    "inclusion_criteria": "<p>About 46 samples were selected for genomic sequencing. Samples that met diagnostic criteria for high grade neuroendocrine neoplasm per WHO criteria were independently reviewed by an additional pathologist with expertise in neuroendocrine tumors to confirm diagnosis. Additional matched normal tissue were also sequenced when available. Waiver of consent and informed consent when appropriate were obtained under the review of the institutional IRB.</p>",

Owing to TP53 mutation in the majority of cases, DNA repair deficiency through loss of BRCA1 and BRCA2, and by expression features patterning a basal cell of origin, TNBC represents a molecularly and clinically distinct group of breast cancer patients. Unfortunately, targetable molecular features of TNBC remain elusive and TNBC patients suffer the poorest outcomes amongst clinical subgroups. Within TNBC patients, responses to treatment vary and although gene expression patterns within TNBC have been identified, little progress has been made in developing biomarkers; effective stratification as a route to directing patients to more targeted therapy is lacking. In this study, we exploit mutational processes in TNBC as a new opportunity to stratify patients and to understand the evolutionary progression of TNBC cells harboring specific DNA repair properties.</p>",

At enrollment, participants completed a mailed self-administered questionnaire including information on demographic, medical, diet, and lifestyle factors. Follow-up questionnaires to update exposure information and to ascertain newly diagnosed cancers were sent biennially starting in 1997. Reported cancers were verified through medical records, state cancer registry linkage, or death certificates. The Emory University Institutional Review Board approves all aspects of the CPS II Nutrition Cohort. We restricted to samples that had blood DNA source.

Cases with a first diagnosis of invasive colorectal cancer (International Classification of Diseases 10 codes C18-C20) who were at least 30 years of age (no upper age limit), German speaking, a resident in the study region, and mentally and physically able to participate in a one-hour interview, were recruited by their treating physicians either in the hospital a few days after surgery, or by mail after discharge from the hospital. Cases were confirmed based on histologic reports and hospital discharge letters following diagnosis of colorectal cancer. All hospitals treating colorectal cancer patients in the study region participated. Based on estimates from population-based cancer registries, more than 50% of all potentially eligible patients with incident colorectal cancer in the study region were included. Community-based controls were randomly selected from population registries, employing frequency matching with respect to age (5-year groups), sex, and county of residence. Controls with a history of colorectal cancer were excluded. Controls were contacted by mail and follow-up calls. The participation rate was 51%. During an in-person interview, data were collected on demographics, medical history, family history of CRC, and various life-style factors, as were blood and mouthwash samples. Routine formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor samples from the patients enrolled were requested from the pathology institutes and used for tumor tissue analyses. This analysis includes participants with blood source DNA that were recruited up to 2010 in this ongoing study. Controls were matched to cases on reference age and sex in a case/control ratio of 2:1.</p> <p><b><a href=\"https://sites.sph.harvard.edu/hpfs/\" target=\"_blank\">Health Professionals Follow-up Study</a> (HPFS): </b>A parallel prospective study to the NHS (Nurses' Health Study). The HPFS cohort comprised 51,529 men aged 40-75 who, in 1986, responded to a mailed questionnaire (Rimm et al., 1990 <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2090285\">PMID:2090285</a>). Participants provided information on health related exposures, including current and past smoking history, age, weight, height, diet, physical activity, aspirin use, and family history of colorectal cancer. Colorectal cancer and other outcomes were reported by participants or next-of-kin and were followed up through review of the medical and pathology record by physicians. Overall, more than 97% of self-reported colorectal cancers were confirmed by medical record review. Information was abstracted on histology and primary location. Incident cases were defined as those occurring after the subject provided the blood sample. Prevalent cases were defined as those occurring after enrollment in the study but before the subject provided the blood sample. Follow-up evaluation has been excellent, with 94% of the men responding to date. Colorectal cancer cases were ascertained through January 1, 2008. In 1993-1995, 18,825 men in the HPFS mailed blood samples by overnight courier, which were aliquoted into buffy coat and stored in liquid nitrogen. In 2001-2004, 13,956 men in the HPFS who had not provided a blood sample previously mailed in a swish-and-spit sample of buccal cells. Incident cases were defined as those occurring after the subject provided a blood or buccal sample. Prevalent cases were defined as those occurring after enrollment in the study in 1986, but before the subject provided either a blood or buccal sample. Participants with histories of cancer (except nonmelanoma skin cancer), ulcerative colitis, or familial polyposis, case-control sets were excluded. Control participants were required to be free of invasive colorectal cancer and non-invasive (stage 0 in situ) colorectal cancer. For this study, only European ancestry participants with blood source DNA and incident colorectal cancer cases were eligible for selection. Since enrollment year and sex matched exactly, controls were randomly selected in a case/control ratio of 2:1.</p> <p><b><a href=\"https://nurseshealthstudy.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Nurses Health Study</a> (NHS): </b>The NHS cohort began in 1976 when 121,700 married female registered nurses age 30-55 years returned the initial questionnaire that ascertained a variety of important health-related exposures (Belanger et al., 1978 <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=248266\">PMID:248266</a>). Since 1976, follow-up questionnaires have been mailed every 2 years. Colorectal cancer and other outcomes were reported by participants or next-of-kin and followed up through review of the medical and pathology record by physicians. Overall, more than 97% of self-reported colorectal cancers were confirmed by medical-record review. Information was abstracted on histology and primary location. The rate of follow-up evaluation has been high: as a proportion of the total possible follow-up time, follow-up evaluation has been more than 92%. Colorectal cancer cases were ascertained through June 1, 2008. In 1989-1990, 32,826 women in NHS I mailed blood samples by overnight courier, which were aliquoted into buffy coat and stored in liquid nitrogen. In 2001-2004, 29,684 women in NHS I who did not previously provide a blood sample mailed a swish-and-spit sample of buccal cells. Incident cases were defined as those occurring after the subject provided a blood or buccal sample. Prevalent cases were defined as those occurring after enrollment in the study in 1976 but before the subject provided either a blood or buccal sample.

Sequential blood samples were collected from participants assigned to the screening arm. Participation was 93% at the baseline blood draw. White colorectal cancer cases with a family history of colorectal cancer (no history of ulcerative colitis, Crohn's Disease, diverticulitis, Gardner's syndrome, Familial Polyposis) and successful genotyping from previous Peters GWAS were selected for this project.

The original WHI study included 161,808 postmenopausal women enrolled between 1993 and 1998. The Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, WA serves as the WHI Clinical Coordinating Center for data collection, management, and analysis of the WHI. The WHI has two major parts: a partial factorial randomized Clinical Trial (CT) and an Observational Study (OS); both were conducted at 40 Clinical Centers nationwide. The CT enrolled 68,132 postmenopausal women between the ages of 50-79 into trials testing three prevention strategies. If eligible, women could choose to enroll in one, two, or all three of the trial components. The components are: <b>Hormone Therapy Trials (HT): </b>This double-blind component examined the effects of combined hormones or estrogen alone on the prevention of coronary heart disease and osteoporotic fractures, and associated risk for breast cancer. Women participating in this component with an intact uterus were randomized to estrogen plus progestin (conjugated equine estrogens [CEE], 0.625 mg/d plus medroxyprogesterone acetate [MPA] 2.5 mg/d) or a matching placebo. Women with prior hysterectomy were randomized to CEE or placebo. Both trials were stopped early, in July 2002 and March 2004, respectively, based on adverse effects. All HT participants continued to be followed without intervention until close-out. <b>Dietary Modification Trial (DM):</b> The Dietary Modification component evaluated the effect of a low-fat and high fruit, vegetable and grain diet on the prevention of breast and colorectal cancers and coronary heart disease. Study participants were randomized to either their usual eating pattern or a low-fat dietary pattern. <b>Calcium/Vitamin D Trial (CaD): </b>This double-blind component began 1 to 2 years after a woman joined one or both of the other clinical trial components. It evaluated the effect of calcium and vitamin D supplementation on the prevention of osteoporotic fractures and colorectal cancer. Women in this component were randomized to calcium (1000 mg/d) and vitamin D (400 IU/d) supplements or a matching placebo. The <b>Observational Study (OS)</b> examines the relationship between lifestyle, environmental, medical and molecular risk factors and specific measures of health or disease outcomes. This component involves tracking the medical history and health habits of 93,676 women not participating in the CT. Recruitment for the observational study was completed in 1998 and participants were followed annually for 8 to 12 years. All centrally confirmed White cases of invasive colorectal cancer, or death from colorectal cancer were selected as potential cases from the March, 2011 database. Case priory lists are: 1) have positive family history of colorectal cancer; 2) randomly select cases until we get a total of n=800 cases. Control participants were required to be White, free of invasive colorectal cancer and non-invasive (stage 0 in situ) colorectal cancer. Centrally denied cases of colorectal cancer were not allowed into the control pool. Case and control participants were subject to the following exclusion criteria: (1) had prior history of colorectal cancer at baseline; (2) had no available DNA (DNA searching as Nov 15, 2012); (3) cannot be deposited to dbGaP; (4) lost to follow-up after enrollment; (5) selected for WHI study M26 Phase II. Controls were matched to cases in a case/control ratio of 2:1. In order to get 2 cases with 1 control, cases were grouped by enrollment year (a total of 5 groups). For each year group, around 50% cases were selected to match controls. In total, 401 cases were selected to match controls. Matching was done on enrollment year, which was matched exactly.

Using ichorCNA, a software tool that quantifies tumor content in ultra-low pass whole genome sequencing (~0.1x) of cfDNA without prior genomic characterization of the tumor, we show genome-wide concordance between cfDNA and tumor biopsies and detectability of high tumor fractions (&gt;0.1) in the cfDNA of many patients with metastatic cancer. We then established that whole-exome sequencing of cfDNA can enable comprehensive profiling of tumors from blood, with high tumor-content cfDNA samples demonstrating concordance of clonal somatic mutations, copy number alterations, mutational signatures, and neoantigens with matched tumor biopsies. This study introduces a new method to identify patients that could be eligible for tumor profiling from cfDNA and sheds light on the concordance between metastatic tissue and blood biopsies.</p>",

Accessible metastatic, non-bone sites (e.g. breast, skin, lymph node, etc) were preferentially identified for biopsy. When feasible, a corresponding blood draw for plasma was performed within seven days of a metastatic tumor biopsy. A subset of patients underwent subsequent blood draws at the time of treatment switch, 4-6 weeks after treatment switch, and every 3 months if on stable treatment.</p> <p>Eligible metastatic prostate cancer patients were identified through the Clinical Research Information System (CRIS) database at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.

The CCFRC was formed as a resource to support studies on the etiology, prevention, and clinical management of colorectal cancer. Recruitment protocols fall broadly into two main categories: population-based and clinic-based ascertainment. Between 1998 and 2013, the CCFR recruited and interviewed probands who were either recently diagnosed with colorectal cancer that was reported to state or regional population cancer registries in the United States (Washington, California, Arizona, Minnesota, Colorado, New Hampshire, North Carolina, and Hawaii), Australia (Victoria), and Canada (Ontario) or were from multiple-case families referred to family-cancer clinics in the United States (Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, and Cleveland Clinic in Cleveland, Ohio), Australia (Melbourne, Adelaide, Perth, Brisbane, and Sydney), New Zealand (Auckland), and Canada. Cases with known familial adenomatous polyposis were excluded. Once recruited, probands were asked for permission to contact their relatives for recruitment. Collectively, we have enrolled 42,49874 participants in 15,048 families who participated in standardized protocols used to collect information regarding family cancer history and colorectal cancer risk factors and biospecimens. All participants of population-based case families (excluding control-families) and clinic-based families are asked to provide updates on their personal and family history of cancer as well as their history of surgery, cancer screening, and some risk factors every 4-5 years either by telephone interview or by self-completed questionnaire via mail or online (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17982118/\" target=\"_blank\">PMID: 17982118</a>).</p>",

    "description": "<p>Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) is a rare and frequently fatal myeloproliferative/myelodysplastic disorder of early childhood with an estimated incidence of 1.2 cases per million. It is associated with a spectrum of diverse outcomes ranging from spontaneous resolution in rare patients to transformation to acute myeloid leukemia in others. The overwhelming majority of JMML patients (~95%) will harbor mutations in canonical Ras pathway genes, including <i><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4763\" target=\"_blank\">NF1</a></i>, <i><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4893\" target=\"_blank\">NRAS</a></i>, <i><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3845\" target=\"_blank\">KRAS</a></i>, <i><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5781\" target=\"_blank\">PTPN11</a></i>, and <i><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/867\" target=\"_blank\">CBL</a></i>. As Ras proteins are mutated in more than 30% of human cancers, the information gleaned from the study of JMML has provided insights into Ras signaling in cancer as well as a group of congenital diseases with tumor predispositions known as the &#8220;Rasopathies&#8221;. While oncogenic Ras is one of the most common mutations in human cancer, it remains one of the most vexing targets for efficacious therapy.</p><p> </p><div> </div><div>To better understand this disease, a JMML tissue bank was established at UCSF that allows for consenting of subjects, biobanking of tissue and collection of follow up data from patients both locally and at other institutions. Through the collection and analysis of specimens, knowledge about the genetic, epigenetic, and biochemical basis of JMML has been gained. This integrated database will enable future JMML research, and importantly, additional Ras/MAPK pathway research by depositing linked, processed data to well annotated anonymized patients in an easily accessible online database </div><br><p></p>",

Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies, such as trastuzumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Lapatinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving paclitaxel with trastuzumab and/or lapatinib before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed.

    "description": "<p>The Breast Cancer Family Registry (BCFR) is a multi-center prospective cohort, comprised of over 30,000 women and men from nearly 12,000 families from the United States, Canada, and Australia. Our BCFR resource has been used, and continues to be used, by breast cancer researchers around the world in order to find new ways to prevent, diagnose, and treat cancer.\n</p><p>The BCFR provides an extensive and diverse range of resources, expertise, and specialized skills, and has several unique strengths: 1) the collection of a large number of individuals and families across a wide spectrum of breast cancer risk, including both affected and unaffected individuals; 2) the large collection of families with early-onset breast cancer; 3) the large collection of racial/ethnic minority families not replicated elsewhere; 4) the extensive molecular characterization performed to date; and 5) active follow-up of both probands and family members. Thus, the BCFR comprises a unique cohort of probands and family members at familial/genetic risk of breast cancer that will continue to facilitate a wide range of research studies, such as gene discovery, examination of cancer-related outcomes and risk factors in high-risk subjects, investigation of novel behavioral interventions, and cancer prevention trials among at-risk family members. Consequently, the BCFR Cohort, as one of the few cohorts available worldwide with biospecimens and extensive molecular and genetic characterization, combined with epidemiologic data and long-term follow up, will be an invaluable resource for translational research in the genetic epidemiology of breast cancer.</p>",

    "report_name": "The Role of CDX2 in Controlling ABCB1 Expression and Chemosensitivity in Human Colon Cancer",
    "description": "<p>This study reports the results of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) experiments performed on two human colon cancer cell lines (HT-29, DLD-1) that were genetically engineered to achieve either the constitutive expression (in HT-29 cells) or the selective inactivation (in DLD-1 cells) of the transcription factor CDX2, a master regulator of embryonic gut development and a key regulator of multi-lineage differentiation in adult colon epithelial cells. Our previous studies had identified lack of CDX2 expression as a prognostic biomarker of poor prognosis and a predictive biomarker of benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy in Stage-II and Stage-III colon cancer patients (Dalerba et al., NEJM, 374:211-222, 2016; <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26789870/\" target=\"_blank\">PMID: 26789870</a>). The molecular basis of these associations, however, remained poorly understood. The present study was designed to identify which genes are under the transcriptional control of CDX2, in order to clarify their role in shaping colon cancer resistance to chemotherapy. Of the two lines included in this study, the first (HT-29) is CDX2-negative at baseline, and was infected with a lentivirus vector encoding for the cDNA of the human CDX2 gene under the control of a constitutive promoter (CMV). The second line (DLD-1) is CDX2-positive at baseline, and was infected with a series of lentivirus vectors encoding for CRISPR/Cas9 constructs designed to selectively inactivate the CDX2 gene. In both cases, infected cells were purified by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), based on the differential expression of a green fluorescent reporter (EGFP) that was also encoded by the lentivirus vectors, and transcribed in tandem with either the CDX2 cDNA (HT-29) or CRISPR/Cas9 gRNAs targeting CDX2 (DLD-1). The experiments were designed to include 3 experimental replicates per condition, and to compare the transcriptional profile of genetically engineered cells with that of autologous controls (i.e., HT-29 cells infected with an \"empty\" version of the same lentivirus vector used to over-express CDX2, DLD-1 cells engineered with a \"non-targeting\" CRISPR/Cas9 gRNA). In the specific case of DLD-1 cells engineered with CRIPSR-Cas9 constructs targeting CDX2, infected cells were sorted based on the differential expression of EGFP and then plated as single-cells, in order to sub-culture three isogenic clones, all of which were genetically sequenced to confirm bi-allelic knock-out of the CDX2 gene, and confirmed to lack CDX2 protein expression by Western blot. The results of our experiments demonstrate that, in human colon epithelial cells, CDX2 controls the expression of the ABCB1 efflux pump, by positively regulating the transcription of the corresponding gene.</p>",

    "description": "<p>By leveraging single-cell transcriptome and T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing, we aimed to track the transcriptional signatures of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell clonotypes throughout the course of treatment and furthermore identify molecular patterns leading to potent CAR T cell cytotoxicity. The data presented in this study encompass blood and bone marrow samples from patients &#8804; 21 years of age with relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) participating in the SJCAR19 phase I/II clinical trial (<a href=\"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03573700\" target=\"_blank\">NCT03573700</a>). In brief, patients enrolled in the clinical trial received either 1 x 10^6 (dose level 1) or 3 x 10^6 (dose level 2) per kilogram of body weight following successful generation of autologous CAR T cell products and lymphodepleting chemotherapy. Peripheral blood was drawn from each participant every week until week 4 post-infusion, at week 6 or 8, and month 3 or 6 if feasible. At week 4 post-infusion, blood marrow was also collected from participants. Total T cells (CD3+) were sorted from each post-infusion sample, as well as the pre-infusion CAR T cell products, and processed through 10x Genomics&#39; single-cell gene expression and V(D)J sequencing platform using the standard protocol. We identified a unique and unexpected transcriptional signature in a subset of pre-infusion CAR T cells that shared TCRs with post-infusion cytotoxic effector CAR T cells. Functional validation of cells with even a subset of these pre-effector markers demonstrated their immediate cytotoxic potential and resistance to exhaustion. The data deposited into dbGaP include all raw single-cell expression and V(D)J sequencing generated from samples obtained from 16 study participants. </p>",

All of the cases were reviewed by experienced hematopathologists to confirm diagnosis. Written informed consents from patients were reviewed and approved by the institutional review board of each institution. We deposited targeted exon sequencing data of a selected 333-gene panel on the ENKTCL cases in dbGaP. DNA was extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues with an AllPrep DNA/RNA FFPE Kit. A custom platform (Agilent SureSelect) was used to capture target exons from genomic DNA of ENKTCL tumors. DNA was fragmented to 200bp using a Covaris S220 Focused-ultrasonicator and was end-repaired and ligated to Illumina adaptors with a KAPA Hyper Prep Kit. Ligated products were purified and amplified with a 7-cycle PCR. Exome capture from the PCR products was performed using a SureSelect Target Enrichment Kit. The captured exomes were further amplified with an 8-cycle PCR and purified for cluster generation using the cBot cluster generation system with a HiSeq PE Cluster Kit V4. 100bp paired-end reads were generated from an Illumina HiSeq 2500 system with a HiSeq SBS Kit V4.</p><p>\n</p>",

    "description": "Pediatric high-grade gliomas (pHGGs), encompassing diffuse midline gliomas (DMGs) and hemispheric tumors, represent the most common cause of cancer-related deaths in children age 0-14 years. Over the last decade, several landmark papers have revealed recurrent single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in the core histones H3.3 and H3.1, co-occurring with alterations in the TP53 signaling pathway and receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). However, the contribution of structural variants (SVs) to gliomagenesis has not been systematically explored. We performed a comprehensive analysis of whole genome sequencing (WGS) data on pediatric high-grade gliomas (pHGGs) from 179 children, including 61 hemispheric tumors and 118 diffuse midline gliomas, or DMGs, of which 61 are novel to this study. Among the DMGs, 84 (71%) were from pre-treatment biopsies including 33 obtained from the first multi-institutional North American clinical trial to incorporate diagnostic biopsies. This represents the largest cohort of pretreatment DMGs with whole genome sequencing to date. This large cohort of whole genome sequences provides an unparalleled opportunity to assess significantly recurrent structural variants in pHGG and their associations with driver SNVs and SCNAs.&#160;",

Understanding the pattern of clonal evolution and transcriptomic changes during the early treatment period with ibrutinib may provide insight into the mechanisms of resistance. We performed whole exome sequencing on sequential samples with matched germline controls from 61 patients with CLL during the first 12 months of ibrutinib monotherapy or ibrutinib in combination with rituximab. Additionally, RNA sequencing was done on a subset of 14 patients treated with ibrutinib monotherapy. The presence of clonal shifts was associated with an increased risk of disease progression, suggesting that resistant clones are more likely to emerge in CLL with greater evolutionary capacity.</p><p>This cohort was later augmented with additional data (including data from 15 additional patients). In total, this second set of data contained whole exome sequencing (31 samples),  RNA sequencing (6 samples) and reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (67 samples) for CLL samples and used them to identify expression subtypes of CLL.

As a direct proof-of-principle regarding the feasibility of employing fragile site breakage to identify and monitor high-risk populations to allow personalized treatments, genome-wide DNA break mapping/sequencing was used to determine whether preferential DNA breaks are generated at the major breakpoint regions of KMT2A in AML remission patients with previously diagnosed KMT2A rearrangement.

Despite its influence on immunotherapy response, few methods exist to detect HLA LOH, and accuracy of the approaches is poorly defined. Here, we present DASH (Deletion of Allele-Specific HLAs), a machine learning-based algorithm developed to detect HLA LOH from paired tumor-normal sequencing data. Using DASH to characterize HLA LOH in 610 patients across 15 cancer types, we found that 18% of patients had loss of heterozygosity in at least one HLA allele, suggesting the HLA LOH is a widespread, and potentially key immune resistance strategy in multiple cancers.<br>",

We also identified copy-number changes and single-nucleotide variants in the serum and urine samples, and compared them to the tumor data. Our study highlights the advantages of using ctDNA as non-invasive prognostic biomarker with the potential to detect tumor heterogeneity in patients with WT. We believe that prospective validation of ctDNA as a prognostic biomarker in patients with WT is warranted.

    "description": "<p>Blood somatic mutations identified across 8,530 solid tumor patients in TCGA cohort. We reasoned that low-coverage whole-genome sequencing of blood samples routinely carried out in cancer genomics projects may be repurposed to detect clonal hematopoiesis (CH). Thus, inspired by a previous approach to identify early mutations in the development of the hematopoietic system, we implemented a pipeline to systematically carry out this \"reverse\" somatic mutation calling on the paired blood/tumor samples. Blood somatic mutations were called using a 'reverse' approach, in which the tumor sample taken from each patient was used as control of their germline genome. Blood somatic mutations are thus detected as variants in the blood (with respect to the human reference genome) that are absent in the tumor sample. The variant calling was carried out in our in house cluster on downloaded blood/tumor BAM files. The matched blood and tumoral BAM files -- masked and deduplicated using GATK -- of 8,530 whole-exome patients were obtained as described above. The variant calling was carried out using Strelka2 (employing default parameters) with the blood sample as the tumoral input and the tumor sample as control (reverse calling). All variants with two or more supporting reads matching the caller PASS filter and with VAF&lt;0.5 were kept. Mutations in lowly mappable regions as defined by the DUST algorithm (k=30) and UMAP68 (36-kmers) were excluded. Contiguous variants were merged into double-base substitutions. Variants with greater frequency across the cohorts than the DNMT3A R882H or JAK2 V617F hotspot in a cohort-specific Panel of Normals and in gnomAD v2.1 were removed. This was equivalent to discarding variants present in these datasets with an allele frequency greater than 0.008 in PoN TCGA and 0.0003 in gnomAD v2.1. Additionally, common SNPs as defined by the dbSNP 151 Common UCSC track and dbSNP were excluded. Mutations within segmental duplications, simple repeats and masked regions as defined in UCSC tracks were also removed. Finally, samples with the mutation count above the 97.5 percentile of the mutation burden across the cohort were deemed unreliable and excluded for further analyses. We call the set of variants obtained after the application of these filters the full set. A more conservative subset of somatic mutations was generated from the full set of blood somatic mutations. To this end, we applied MosaicForecast, a software designed to phase mutations to polymorphisms with the aim of identifying somatic mutations in a small number of cells and also predict mosaicism for the unphased ones with a random forest classifier. As a result, we obtained a subset of mosaic-phased mutations, and a subset of mutations likely to be somatic (mosaic set).</p><p>In order to obtain access to this study, please first obtain access to TCGA study (<a href=\"./study.cgi?study_id=phs000178\">phs000178</a>).</p>",

    "report_name": "Genome-Wide Analysis of Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (De Novo and Derived from the High Grade Transformation of Follicular Lymphoma)",
    "description": "<p><b>Version 1.</b> Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) represents the most common form of B-cell non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (B-NHL), accounting for ~30% of the <i>de novo</i> diagnoses and also arising as a frequent clinical evolution of Follicular Lymphoma (FL). The molecular pathogenesis of DLBCL is associated with multiple genetic lesions that in part distinctly segregate with individual phenotypic subtypes, suggesting the involvement of distinct oncogenic pathways. However, the lesions identified so far likely represent only a fraction of those necessary for malignant transformation. In order to characterize the entire set of structural alterations present in the DLBCL genome, we have integrated next generation whole exome sequencing analysis of 6 DLBCL cases and genome-wide high-density SNP array analysis of 72 DLBCL cases. We report here that FL and DLBCL harbor frequent structural alterations inactivating <i>CREBBP</i> and, more rarely, <i>EP300</i>, two highly related histone and non-histone acetyltransferases (HATs) that act as transcriptional co-activators in multiple signaling pathways. Overall, ~37% of DLBCL and 36% of FL cases display genomic deletions and/or somatic point mutations that remove or inactivate the HAT coding domain of these two genes. These lesions commonly affect a single allele, suggesting that reduction in HAT dosage is important for lymphomagenesis. We demonstrate specific defects in the acetylation-mediated inactivation of the BCL6 oncoprotein and activation of the p53 tumor suppressor. These results identify <i>CREBBP/EP300</i> mutations as a major pathogenic mechanism shared by common forms of B-NHL, and have direct implications for the use of drugs targeting acetylation/deacetylation mechanisms.</p> <p><b>Version 2.</b> Follicular lymphoma (FL) is an indolent, but incurable disease that, in 30-40% of cases, undergoes transformation to an aggressive diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The history of clonal evolution and the mechanisms that underlie transformation to DLBCL (tFL) remain largely unknown. Using whole exome sequencing and copy number analysis of 39 tFL patients, including 12 with paired sequential FL/tFL biopsies, we show that, in most cases, FL and tFL arise by divergent evolution from a common mutated precursor cell through the acquisition of distinct genetic lesions. Mutations in epigenetic modifiers (e.g., <i>MLL2, CREBBP, EZH2, ARID1A</i>) and anti-apoptotic genes (<i>BCL2, FAS</i>) were observed in 93% (36/39) and 78% (30/39) of cases, respectively, and were invariably shared between the two disease phases, suggesting an early acquisition in the common mutated precursor. Conversely, the development of tFL is associated with deregulation of genes involved in the control of cell proliferation, cell cycle progression and DNA damage responses (<i>CDKN2A/2B, MYC, TP53</i>), as well as with an aberrant activity of the somatic hypermutation mechanism. Finally, we show that the genomic profile of tFL shares significant similarities with that of germinal center B-cell type <i>de novo</i> DLBCL, but also displays unique combinations of altered genes that may explain the dismal clinical course of tFL.</p><p><b>Version 3. </b>This version includes thirty-five additional de novo DLBCL samples, newly diagnosed, and their paired normal DNA from previously untreated patients, which were analyzed by whole exome sequencing (n=27T and 25N), whole genome sequencing (8T and 10N), and/or targeted HLA-next generation sequencing (n=26T/N pairs) in order to identify genetic alterations associated with loss of surface MHC-II expression.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Cancer immunotherapy with checkpoint blockade (CPB) leads to improved outcomes in melanoma and other tumor types, but a majority of patients do not respond. High tumor mutation burden (TMB) and high levels of tumor-infiltrating T cells have been associated with response to immunotherapy, and integrative models using DNA and RNA have improved predictions of clinical benefit. However, identification of immune and tumor-intrinsic features in models using DNA or RNA alone have not been comprehensively explored in melanoma. In this study, we sequenced DNA and RNA of tumors from 67 melanoma patients receiving CPB, and aggregated this cohort with previously published data, yielding whole exome sequencing (WES) data for 189 patients and bulk RNA sequencing data for 178 patients. Using these datasets, we derived genomic and transcriptomic factors that predict overall survival (OS) and response to immunotherapy. Using whole exome DNA data alone, we calculated T cell burden (TCB) and B cell burden (BCB) based on rearranged TCR/Ig DNA sequences, and found that melanoma patients with high TMB and either high TCB or high BCB survived longer and had higher response rates, as compared to patients with low TMB and either low TCB or low BCB. Next, using bulk RNA-Seq data, differential expression analysis identified 83 genes which are associated with high or low OS. By combining pairs of immune-expressed genes with tumor-expressed genes, we identified three gene pairs which are associated with response and survival (Bonferroni P&lt;0.05). All three gene pair models were validated in an independent cohort (n=180) (Bonferroni P&lt;0.05). The best performing gene pair model included the lymphocyte-expressed MAP4K1 (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=MAP4K1\" target=\"_blank\">Gene ID: 11184</a>) and the transcription factor TBX3 (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=TBX3\" target=\"_blank\">Gene ID: 6926</a>) which is overexpressed in poorly differentiated melanomas. We concluded that RNA-based (MAP4K1 and TBX3) or DNA-based (TCB and TMB) models combining with immune and tumor measures improve predictions of outcome after checkpoint blockade in melanoma.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Prostate Cancer (PrCa), the most frequently diagnosed solid tumor in men in the U.S., results in ~192,000 new cases and ~27,000 deaths per year. Although the variation of PrCa incidence is likely to be the result of several factors, there is a large body of literature that strongly implicates a genetic etiology. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have emerged as the most widely used contemporary approach to identify genetic variants (in particular SNPs) that are associated with increased risk of human disease. For PrCa, at least five GWAS have now been performed yielding a substantial number of well-validated SNPs that are associated with an increased risk of PrCa, and that number continues to grow. A significant problem for many of the PrCa risk-SNPs identified so far, however, is that they do not lie within or near a known gene and they have no obvious functional properties. These findings suggest that many (if not most) of these risk-SNPs will be located in regulatory regions that control gene expression rather than in coding regions that may directly affect protein function. Therefore, in order to define the functional role of currently known risk-SNPs, the target genes must first be identified. A promising strategy to address this problem involves the use of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis. Unfortunately, most of the publically available SNP-Transcript eQTL datasets utilize lymphoblastoid cells with only a handful using tissue from target organs. Although useful, these datasets alone are unlikely to be sufficient. Recent studies have demonstrated that gene expression and gene regulation occur in both a tissue-specific and tissue independent fashion and suggest that a complete repertoire of regulatory SNPs can only be uncovered in the context of cell type specificity. To date, such a tissue-specific dataset for normal prostate tissue does not exist. In this study, we have constructed a normal prostate tissue specific eQTL data set. </p>",

    "description": "<p>The Exceptional Responders Initiative is a pilot study to investigate the underlying molecular factors driving exceptional treatment responses of cancer patients to drug therapies. Study researchers will examine molecular profiles of tumors from patients either enrolled in a clinical trial for an investigational drug(s) and who achieved an exceptional response relative to other trial participants, or who achieved an exceptional response to a non-investigational chemotherapy. An exceptional response is defined as achievement of either a complete response or a partial response for at least 6 months duration in a trial or treatment where the overall response rate is &#60; 10%. The hope is to discover underlying molecular features that can be further investigated and may eventually predict benefit from a given drug or class of drugs for a particular patient.</p> <p>This pilot project will successfully characterize approximately 100 cases of tumor tissue and, when available, case-matched germline DNA. All samples will undergo whole exome sequencing, and cases with sufficient nucleic acids will undergo additional analyses (e.g. whole genome sequencing, mRNA-sequencing, mi RNA sequencing, promoter methylation analysis, SNP etc). Each case will be annotated with demographic and clinical information, along with follow-up information minimally sufficient to correlate molecular profiles with response. Both retrospective and prospective collections will be considered. The project will also accept sequencing data and clinical data from patients who have had sequencing performed outside of this project. All data will be de-identified and placed in a controlled access database so other investigators may use them for additional insights.</p> <p>Clinically annotated tissue specimens meeting the criteria will be provided by groups participating in the Exceptional Cases Initiative to a Biospecimen Core Resource (BCR), which will perform quality control on the tissues, and will use a standard operating procedure to isolate nucleic acids. The nucleic acids will be shipped to a sequencing center to perform whole exome sequencing and analysis. These findings will be made available to the broader cancer research community in a controlled access database.</p>",

    "description": "<p>A consistent correlation between tumor mutation burden (TMB) and tumor immune microenvironment has not been observed in gliomas as in other cancers. Driver germline and somatic mutations, TMB, neoantigen, and immune cell signatures were analyzed using whole exome sequencing (WES) and transcriptome sequencing of tumor and WES of matched germline DNA in a cohort of 66 glioma samples (44 IDH-mutant and 22 IDH-wildtype). Fourteen samples revealed a hypermutator phenotype (HMP). Eight pathogenic (P) or likely pathogenic (LP) germline variants were detected in 9 (19%) patients. Six of these 8 genes were DNA damage repair genes. P/LP germline variants were found in 22% of IDH-mutant gliomas and 12.5%of IDH-wildtype gliomas (p= 0.7).  TMB was correlated with expressed neoantigen but showed an inverse correlation with immune score (R =&#8722;0.46, p= 0.03) in IDH-wildtype tumors and no correlation in IDH-mutant tumors. Antigen Processing and Presentation (APP) score correlates with immune score. The APP is higher in non-hypermutator phenotype (NHMP) samples versus HMP samples in the IDH-wildtype gliomas, but higher in HMP samples versus NHMP samples in the IDH-mutant gliomas. Conclusion: TMB was inversely correlated with the immune score in the IDH-wildtype gliomas, and showed no correlation in the IDH-mutant tumors. The APP was correlated with the immune score, and may be further investigated as a biomarker for response to immunotherapy in gliomas. Studies of germline variants in a large glioma cohort are warranted.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Germ cell tumors (GCTs) are the most common cancer in men between the ages of 15-40. While most patients are cured, those with disease arising in the mediastinum have distinctly poor outcomes. One in every 17 patients with primary mediastinal non-seminomatous GCTs develop an incurable hematologic malignancy and prior data intriguingly suggests a clonal relationship exists between hematologic malignancies and GCTs in these cases. To date however, the precise clonal relationship between GCTs and the diverse additional somatic malignancies arising in such individuals has not been determined. Here, we traced the clonal evolution and characterized the genetic features of each neoplasm from a cohort of fifteen patients with GCTs and associated hematologic malignancies. We discovered that GCTs and hematologic malignancies developing in such individuals evolved from a common shared precursor, nearly all of which harbored allelically imbalanced TP53 and/or RAS pathway mutations. Hematologic malignancies arising in this setting genetically resembled mediastinal GCTs rather than <i>de novo</i> myeloid neoplasms. Our findings argue that this scenario represents a unique clinical syndrome, distinct from <i>de novo</i> GCTs or hematologic malignancies, initiated by an ancestral precursor which gives rise to the parallel evolution of GCTs and blood cancers in these patients.</p> <p>Reprinted from PMID: 32897884, with permission from JCI. </p>",

    "description": "<p>Multiple Myeloma (MM) is a plasma cell dyscrasia characterized by bone marrow (BM) infiltration and lytic bone lesions. Recent studies of massive parallel sequencing of tumor cells obtained from the BM of patients with MM have demonstrated significant clonal heterogeneity in MM. Despite this remarkable clonal heterogeneity, it could be envisioned that such clonal diversity may be even higher since single BM samples only represent a small fraction of the whole BM compartment, and the pattern of BM infiltration in MM is typically patchy. In addition, BM biopsies are painful and cannot be repeated multiple times during the course of therapy, indicating a need for less invasive methods to molecularly characterize MM patients and monitor disease progression during the therapy. Thus, optimal characterization of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) may represent a non-invasive method to capture relevant mutations present in PC clones.</p> <p>In addition, MM almost always progresses from precursor states of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS)/smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM) to overt MM. However, some patients rapidly progress from MGUS/SMM to overt MM (progressors) with a rate of progression of up to 70% over 5 years, while others remain indolent with minimal progression over the same time period (non-progressors). Although many patients are diagnosed with earlier phases of disease, most patients do not receive treatment until their disease progresses, at which time they have overt end-organ damage. This concept of initiating therapy at the time of symptomatic disease is analogous to initiating therapy in patients with solid tumors only after the development of measurable metastatic disease. It is therefore not surprising that cure is not achieved for most patients with MM.</p> <p>Interestingly, studies have demonstrated that MGUS/SMM clones may already harbor chromosomal alterations (Ig loci or hyperdiploidy) and that progression to MM is mainly due to expansion of clones that were already present in the early stages of MGUS/SMM. However, the biological factors that discriminate progressors from non-progressors in MGUS/SMM are not well known.</p> <p>Therefore, our overarching hypothesis is that an effective therapeutic intervention will result from defining genomic and transcriptomic markers that are associated with disease progression. We believe, therefore, that focused research studies that define molecular mechanisms of clonal evolution in MGUS/SMM/MM will identify novel biomarkers of disease progression and help develop therapeutic agents that prevent or delay progression from MGUS to overt MM. Indeed, by eradicating the disease at the precursor stages, MM may become a preventable disease.</p> <p>Recently, a new term called Clonal Hematopoiesis of Indeterminate Potential (CHIP) has been proposed to describe asymptomatic individuals with hematologic malignancy-associated somatic mutations. Those individuals do not fulfill any diagnostic criteria for any hematological malignancy yet they have a tendency to progress into myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or myeloid or lymphoid neoplasia at a rate of around 0.5-1% per year, similar to MGUS. The frequency of CHIP and role of HSCs mutations in enhancing acquisition of somatic mutations in MM plasma cells, allowing progression following treatment, has not been studied. Investigating the dysregulated pathways in early progenitor cells would allow us to understand the reasons of progression and establish novel therapeutic and potentially preventive strategies.</p> <p>This study dissects genomic and transcriptomic characteristics of clonal evolution from MGUS/SMM to MM as well as the characteristics of the tumor microenvironment/immune cells/peripheral blood. Our hypothesis is that molecular biomarkers will be strong predictors of progression from MGUS/SMM to MM and will allow for the development of novel therapeutic agents that prevent or delay this progression. We aim to define genomic and transcriptomic markers that lead to progression from MGUS/SMM to MM in tumor cells, blood biopsies (cell free DNA and circulating tumor cells), and the tumor microenvironment.</p>",

It consisted of 51,529 U.S. male health professionals who were 40-75 years old at baseline in 1986 and completed a mailed six-page baseline questionnaire. Information on age, height and weight, ancestry, medications, disease history, physical activity, lifestyle factors, and diet were gathered, with follow-up questionnaires sent biennially to update information and record health outcomes with every four years to update their diet. This datafile includes responses to the 2016 questionnaire, which is available at:<a href=\"https://cdn1.sph.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/2471/2017/09/16L.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> https://cdn1.sph.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/2471/2017/09/16L.pdf</a>",
    "history": "<p>The Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (HPFS) began in 1986. At the beginning, Walter Willett (Principal Investigator), Meir Stampfer, and colleagues enlisted 51,529 men in health professions to participate in the study. This group is composed of 29,683 dentists, 4,185 pharmacists, 3,745 optometrists, 2,220 osteopath physicians, 1,600 podiatrists, and 10,098 veterinarians. Among the study participants are 531 African-Americans and 877 Asian-Americans. Every two years, members of the study receive questionnaires with questions about diseases and health-related topics like smoking, physical activity, and medications taken. The questionnaires that ask detailed dietary information are administered in four-year intervals. Biospecimens in the HPFS cohort include blood, DNA, tumor tissue, and toenails.<br></p>",

    "description": "In this study, we performed metabolite profiling and RNA-sequencing on human breast cancer tumors and normal breast tissue samples, including triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), estrogen receptor positive breast cancer (ER+) and paired normal samples, and patient-derived xenografts (PDX) samples. Here, we report two distinctive groups defined by metabolites; a TNBC-HIGH group that shows high levels of pyrimidine pathway metabolites and biosynthetic enzymes, and an ER-HIGH group that shows high levels of fatty acid and arginine biosynthesis intermediates. We identify different metabolic enrichment profiles between cell lines grown in vitro vs. in vivo; cell lines grown in vivo recapitulate patient tumors metabolic profiles. Further, we identify a subset of genes that strongly correlates with the TNBC-HIGH metabolic profile using integrated metabolic and gene expression profiling, which strongly predicts patient prognosis when tested on larger human datasets. As a proof-of-principle, when we target TNBC-HIGH metabolic dysregulation with a pyrimidine biosynthesis inhibitor (Brequinar), and/or a glutaminase inhibitor (CB-839), we observe therapeutic efficacy and decreased tumor growth in representative TNBC cell lines, murine p53-null mammary tumors, and in vivo patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) upon multi-agent drug treatment. This study highlights potential new therapeutic opportunities in breast cancers guided by a genomic biomarker, which could prove impactful for breast cancers that rapidly proliferate.",

Matched melanoma tumor, distant vitiligo-affected skin, and blood were collected and sorted for T cells to perform paralleled single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single-cell TCR sequencing (scTCR-seq) on the day of tissue collection. The transcriptional analysis identified three resident memory T (TRM) cell subsets which were shared between tumors and vitiligo-affected skin. scRNA-seq identified CD8+ T-cell clonotypes in tumors that co-existed as TRM in skin and as effector memory T (TEM) cells in blood.

    "description": "We performed systematic and comprehensive multi-sector immunogenomic analyses on 93 samples from a cohort of 30 patients with primary or recurrent gliomas or metastatic brain tumors, representing the largest cohort of these brain cancers studied spatially to date. For each patient, we characterized multiple spatially distinct regions using whole-exome (WES), custom capture validation, RNA, and TCR-sequencing. Our findings underscore the significant differences in clonal architecture between gliomas and metastatic brain tumors which translates into distinct neoantigen landscapes and, in turn, tumor infiltrating T cell clonotypic diversity. These data therefore provide high resolution insights into the immunogenomic landscapes within malignant brain tumors which may inform tumor-specific therapeutic approaches.",

We previously showed that these hotspots for genome instability reside in late-replicating domains associated with large transcribed genes. In this study, we compared aphidicolin (APH)-induced CNV and CFS frequency between wild-type cells and isogenic cells in which FHIT gene transcription was ablated. We further examined the impact of altering RNase H1 expression on CNV or CFS induction frequency and analyzed R-loop formation genome-wide in a human fibroblast cell line. Data sets include Bru-seq nascent RNA transcription, whole genome sequencing for replication timing, SNP microarray analysis, and DRIP-seq. Results suggest that large gene transcription is a determining factor in replication stress-induced genomic instability and that CFSs mainly result from transcription-dependent passage of unreplicated DNA into mitosis with low R-loop levels observed at these loci.</p>",

Risk of systemic ALCL is markedly increased among immunosuppressed people, such as those with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or solid organ transplant recipients. This increased risk in immunosuppressed populations suggests a viral etiology, given similar elevations for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), Burkitt lymphoma, and Hodgkin lymphoma (caused by Epstein-Barr virus [EBV]) and other virus-related cancers in immunosuppressed individuals. EBV might be a plausible candidate, but most reported ALCL tumors are EBV-negative. Therefore, we conducted a metagenomic analysis of microbial associations with ALCL to determine whether a known or novel pathogen is associated with the tumor. </p> <p> We obtained archived formal fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) ALCL tumor tissue from the Iowa cancer registry and an additional case from an immunosuppressed individual infected with human immunodeficiency virus. Controls included 3 diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs) in transplant recipients (shown to be related to Epstein-Barr virus [EBV] by in situ hybridization) and 3 breast cancers (no known viral etiology). RNA was extracted from FFPE specimens, and total RNA libraries were prepared using the KAPA RNA HyperPrep Kit (Roche). Five samples (IA01, IA53, IA57, IA07, and IA17) were sequenced on a NextSeq 500 (Illumina) and the remainder on a NovSeq 6000 (Illumina). Using novel computational approaches, we eliminated human reads and aligned residual non-human reads to known microbial references using GATK-PathSeq or conducted de novo assembly of unassigned reads using virID pipeline. </p> <p> Although EBV was detected in the 3 DLBCL controls, we did not detect EBV or any novel pathogen in ALCL tumors or in the breast cancers.

Nearly 50% of patients with advanced TNBC will develop brain metastases (BrM), commonly with progressive extracranial disease. Immunotherapy has shown promise in the treatment of advanced TNBC; however, the immunogenomics of BrM remains largely unknown. Thus, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of TNBC BrM and matched primary tumors to characterize the genomic and immune landscape of TNBC BrM to foster the development of immunotherapy strategies in this aggressive and clinically unmet disease.&#160;&#160;",

    "description": "<p>Significant racial differences have been observed in the incidence and clinical outcomes of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) in the United States, but to the authors' knowledge it remains unclear whether genomic differences contribute to these disparities. To understand the influences of genetic ancestry on tumor genomic alterations, the authors estimated the genetic ancestry of 1001 previously described patients (Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform) with DLBCL using unsupervised model-based Admixture global ancestry analysis applied to exome sequencing data and examined the mutational profile of DLBCL driver genes in tumors obtained from this cohort. Global ancestry prediction identified 619 patients with &gt;90% European ancestry, 81 patients with &gt;90% African ancestry, and 50 patients with &gt;90% Asian ancestry. Compared with patients with DLBCL with European ancestry, patients with African ancestry were aged &gt;10 years younger at the time of diagnosis and were more likely to present with B symptoms, elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase, extranodal disease, and advanced stage disease. Patients with African ancestry demonstrated worse overall survival compared with patients with European ancestry (median, 4.9 years vs 8.8 years; P=.04). Distinct prevalence and patterns of mutation highlight an important difference in the mutational landscapes of DLBCL arising in different ancestry groups. This study has the potential to identify genes that contribute to increased DLBCL risk in African Americans and may have implications for tailored treatment of DLBCL in African Americans.</p><p>1001 DLBCL genomic data was downloaded from the European Genome-Phenome Archive (EGA) website (<a href=\"https://ega-archive.org/datasets/EGAD00001003600\" target=\"_blank\">https://ega-archive.org/datasets/EGAD00001003600</a>).&nbsp;</p>",

    "description": "Alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (ARMS) is a highly aggressive pediatric soft tissue cancer characterized by a recurrent 2;13 chromosome translocation. This translocation generates a <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5077\">PAX3</a>-<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2308\">FOXO1</a> (P3F) fusion gene, which encodes a chimeric transcription factor with oncogenic activity.  Using a human myoblast system that models targeted therapy directed against P3F, we demonstrated that the expression of the fibroblast growth factor 8 (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2253\">FGF8</a>), a direct transcriptional target of P3F, is necessary and sufficient for PAX3-FOXO1-independent tumor recurrence in addition to be required for the tumorigenic activity of primary tumors expressing P3F.  In addition, we showed that FGF8 is expressed in human rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines that express P3F. We also demonstrated that FGF8 contributes to their proliferation and transformation in vitro, and is sufficient to maintain their oncogenicity after the loss of P3F expression. We suggest that targeting the expression of the PAX3-FOXO1 transcription factor can generate resistance and recommend that additional anticipated therapeutic approaches, such as targeting FGF8 pathway, may avoid this resistance mechanism.",

    "description": "<p>Current understanding of acquired resistance to osimertinib in EGFR-mutant lung cancer is largely based on the use of targeted sequencing platforms and cell-free DNA. In this study we examined the clonal evolution and heterogeneity of acquired resistance mechanisms to osimertinib through whole exome and RNA-sequencing of prospectively collected pre-and post-osimertinib resistant tumors and metastases at rapid autopsy.</p> <p>We enrolled 34 patients with histologically confirmed EGFR mutant advanced lung adenocarcinoma in a prospective Phase II clinical trial to evaluate osimertinib treatment and the use of local ablative therapy (LAT) for oligoprogressive disease (<a href=\"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02759835\" target=\"_blank\">NCT02759835</a>) in EGFR mutant NSCLC from April 2016 until data cutoff in September 2019. Patients were not selected based on oligometastatic status, rather 32/34 patients had multiple organ involvement, including lung, liver, adrenal, brain and bone. Biopsies or surgeries were performed pre-osimertinib treatment and at first progression on osimertinib. A subset of patients also underwent biopsies at second progression on osimertinib, and following end of life in-patient hospice and rapid autopsy upon death. 63% (n=15/24) of first-line osimertinib and 50% (n=5/10) of second-line osimertinib treated patients had RECIST defined partial response. Overall, 21 patients had RECIST defined first progression on osimertinib. Two patients on this trial discontinued treatment and were lost to follow up. Of the 21 patients who had RECIST defined progression, 14 patients underwent LAT (8 first-line and 6 second-line). Twelve patients had paired pre- and post-osimertinib resistant tumors and three had post-osimertinib resistant tumors available for analysis. Four patients (LAT002, LAT006, LAT014 and LAT021) consented for a rapid autopsy protocol and underwent rapid autopsy after deatH. To elucidate acquired osimertinib resistance mechanisms, we performed whole-exome (WES), targeted sequencing and RNA-seq on 66 tumors and matched germline DNA from tumor tissue obtained from a total of 15 patients.</p>",

The other four funded GAME-ON projects were: the ColoRectal TransdisciplinaryStudy (CORECT), Elucidating Loci Involved in Prostate Cancer Susceptibility (ELLIPSE), Discovery, Biology, and Risk of Inherited Variants in Breast Cancer (DRIVE), and Transdisciplinary Research in Cancer of the Lung (TRICL).</p> <p>As part of our aim to discover, expand, and replicate ovarian cancer susceptibility loci, the GAME-ON projects and other consortia formed the OncoArray network (<a hef=\"http://epi.grants.cancer.gov/oncoarray/\" href=\"http://epi.grants.cancer.gov/oncoarray/\">http://epi.grants.cancer.gov/oncoarray/</a>) to develop and genotype a new custom genotyping array in large numbers of cancer cases and controls (over 400,000 samples) across multiple cancer types. The FOCI data includes over 50,000 ovarian cancer cases and controls genotyped with the Oncoarray at the Center for Inherited Disease Research (CIDR).

Combined loss of tumor suppressors RB1, TP53, PTEN are frequent in NEPC but also present in a subset of prostate adenocarcinomas. Most clinical and preclinical studies support a trans-differentiation process, whereby NEPC arises clonally from a prostate adenocarcinoma precursor during the course of treatment resistance. Here we highlight a case of NEPC with significant intra-patient heterogeneity observed across metastases.

Whereas genome duplication was common and highly concordant between primary and metastatic samples, only 25% of primary-metastasis pairs had =50% concordance at the level of DNA copy number alterations (CNAs). Evolutionary-based analyses revealed that most mutations arose after CNAs at the respective loci in both primary and metastatic samples, with oncogenic mutations enriched in the set of early occurring mutations versus variants of unknown significance (VUS). <em>TP53</em> pathway alterations were identified in nine cisplatin-resistant cases and had the highest degree of concordance in primary and metastatic specimens, consistent with their association with this treatment-resistant phenotype. </p> <p> <strong>Conclusions: </strong> Analysis of paired primary and metastatic GCT specimens revealed significant molecular heterogeneity for both CNAs and somatic mutations. Among loci demonstrating serial genetic evolution, most somatic mutations arose after CNAs but oncogenic mutations were enriched in the set of early occurring mutations as compared to VUS. Alterations in <em>TP53</em> were clonal when present and shared among primary-metastasis pairs. </p> <strong> <em> Reprinted from pending publication, with permission from JCO Precision Oncology. </em> </strong>",

    "description": "<p>This is a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of conversion from active surveillance (AS) for prostate cancer (PC) to treatment. AS is the monitoring with screening tests and/or biopsies over time of men usually with low-risk, early-stage PC to avoid harmful side effects of PC treatment. \"Conversion\" refers to patients who withdraw from AS (switch to active treatment) due to changes in their cancer development, anxiety about delayed treatment, or other reasons. Patients who converted because of anxiety alone were censored in the GWAS analysis. The overall goal of this study is to develop an easily measurable, germline-based panel of genetic variants to aid in selecting PC patients appropriate for AS and/or the intensity of monitoring.</p> <p>In total, 6,324 PC patients from 28 collaborating institutions are included in this study. Patients are those with PC who are either on AS or who have previously converted from AS to treatment. In this study, 70% of all subjects were diagnosed with very low-risk, low-risk, or low-volume intermediate-risk PC (Kryvenko and Epstein, 2016; <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26709152/\" target=\"_blank\">PMID: 26709152</a>) and have been enrolled in an AS program. <br></p> <p>DNA was extracted from blood, saliva, or formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue collected from the study subjects at the participating sites. Genotyping, quality control processes, and imputation were performed at the Center for Inherited Disease Research (CIDR) at Johns Hopkins University. CIDR used the Illumina Infinium Multi-Ethnic Global Array (MEGA) version 1, which included genome-wide tag SNPs and 10,000 SNPs selected with custom content. Quality control and assurance (QC/QA) checks on genotyped data involved four domains: sample-level checks, batch effects, SNP-level checks, and preliminary association tests. Samples and SNPs passing the QC/QA checks were imputed to appropriate reference panels (HRC r1.1 for patients of European ancestry) using the Michigan Imputation Server (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27571263/\" target=\"_blank\">PMID: 27571263</a>). Unmeasured genetic variants were imputed using the Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) Imputation Server, with 97,256 reference samples and 308,107,085 SNPs. Variants with imputation quality (INFO) score &lt; 0.3 were excluded, leaving a total of 22,691,641 SNPs successfully imputed. After QC steps, a total of 5,936 samples genotyped at CIDR remained for inclusion in the GWAS.<br></p>",

We investigated somatic mutations in &gt;100 patients by whole exome and myeloid malignancy targeted array sequencing to identify acquired mutations associated with myeloid malignancies. MDS was the most common diagnosis (~45%), followed by GATA2 Bone Marrow Immunodeficiency Disorder (G2BMID) (~35%). Approximately ten percent of our cohort  were unaffected \"carrier\" family members with no disease manifestations. In contrast, about ten percent had progressed to a proliferative leukemia. There were no correlations with GATA2 mutation, patient age or gender and disease progression or survival. Somatic Recurrent somatic mutations were uncommon in cancer associated genes, and virtually absent in asymptomatic patients. However, mutations in the cohesin gene STAG2 and chromatin remodeling gene ASXL1 were detected in ~20% of patients. Patients with ASXL1 mutations had a lower survival. ASXL1 mutations were ~10-times more prevalent in female patients than males. Other recurrent mutations were in the DNMT3A, BCOR, and SETBP1 genes.

While patients with primary glioblastoma (GBM) have benefited from increased overall survival due to treatment with the alkylating chemotherapy temozolomide (TMZ), the benefit of TMZ for patients with diffuse low-grade gliomas (LGG) remains unknown. To further explore the relationships among TMZ treatment, hypermutation and malignant progression, we studied tumor evolution in an expanded cohort of untreated and TMZ-treated patients by exome-sequencing of paired IDH1/2-mutant LGGs and their post-TMZ recurrences. Together, these findings further our understanding of the molecular features and clinical behavior of hypermutated clones.</p> <p>The heterogeneity present in individual tumors, i.e. intratumoral heterogeneity (ITH), is thought to be a major reason why targeted treatments eventually fail. However, we know little about ITH in most human tumors because studies typically analyze one biopsy per tumor without knowledge of where in the tumor the sample was taken. Understanding how malignant and non-malignant cellular populations are distributed in 3D tumor space is foundational knowledge for resolving how human tumors grow, with translational implications for identifying representative biopsy specimens and predicting the impact of targeted therapy.</p> <p>Diffuse gliomas are incurable brain tumors with variably aggressive molecular subtypes. To determine the extent of ITH and its 3D organization in diffuse glioma, we prospectively collected a median of 10 spatially mapped samples from newly diagnosed and recurrent patient tumors, including aggressive canonical <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=3417\">IDH1</a>/<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=3418\">IDH2</a> wild-type (IDH-wtc) glioblastoma, slower-growing IDH1/IDH2 mutant (IDHmut) glioma and a noncanonical IDH-wt glioblastoma (IDH-wtnc) lacking the <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=7015\">TERT</a> promoter mutation typical of canonical Glioblastoma.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Data on transgenerational effects following nuclear accidents are important for understanding fully the consequences of parental exposure to ionizing radiation. Few studies to date have had adequate statistical power to detect effects of the magnitude expected based on animal data, and most have not been of low-dose, protracted exposures associated with nuclear accidents and their aftermath. Although, to date, scant use has been made of the new genomic technologies, in Chernobyl-exposed areas of Ukraine and Belarus, excess minisatellite mutations have been seen in children born after the accident. We propose a study of parent-child trios in which at least one parent was exposed to Chernobyl radiation as a clean-up worker (mean dose&#62;&#61;100 mGy) and&#47;or evacuee from a contaminated area (mean &#62;&#61;50 mGy). The specific aims are to investigate the transgenerational and de novo mutation rates of the spectrum of genetic variants in trios, in particular looking at effects in children and mapping them to possible parental origin of the chromsoome. Together with long-term collaborators at the Research Center for Radiation Medicine (RCRM) in Kiev, epidemiologic data will be collected for up to 450 trios of parents with preconceptional doses and their unexposed offspring. We will use state-of-the-art genomic technologies to characterize the landscape of the genomes of the trios to determine whether parental radiation exposure is associated with genetic mutations transmitted to the offspring, by examining de novo mutation rates, minisatellite mutations, copy number alterations, and variations in telomere length. The analysis will be conducted in peripheral blood and/or buccal samples (when blood is not available) from complete father-mother-child trios. Doses to the gonads from the time of the accident to the time of conception will be reconstructed for all parents using existing records supplemented by interview data.</p> <p>Trio subjects will be selected from representative populations exposed to radiation from Chernobyl who are under active follow-up in the Clinico-Epidemiologic Registry at RCRM. To help identify specific effects of paternal and maternal radiation exposure, we will initially select sets of trio subjects in five categories: (1) exposed father, unexposed mother; (2) unexposed father, exposed mother; (3) both parents exposed; (4) both parents unexposed; and (5) a group of high dose &#34;emergency workers&#34; with acute radiation syndrome. All trio members will be invited to the RCRM outpatient clinic for collection of a 20 ml blood sample (or buccal cells for those who refuse phlebotomy). Both parents will be asked to complete a general questionnaire to obtain demographic and lifestyle data. Then one or both will complete detailed dosimetry questionnaires, based on forms used in previous collaborations with RCRM and administered by specially trained interviewers. Once 50 trios have been recruited (10 from each of the 5 exposure categories), we will conduct an interim evaluation of participation rates, sample collection and quality, and dose reconstruction in order to modify the protocol as needed. The analytical approach will be to correlate the extent, especially for de novo events of genetic alterations in the offspring with parental pre-conceptional radiation dose overall and by parental origin. The statistical power in relation to de novo mutations is very high, in excess of 90&#37;, but somewhat lower for trends in minisatellite mutations. Study findings will contribute importantly to knowledge of the heritable effects of moderate- and low-dose radiation exposure in humans and to radiation risk projection. Eventually data from the Trio Study may be shared with the international community through dbGap.</p>",

The offspring can be of either sex but must be adult (age &#62;&#61; 18 years at interview); if more than one child is born to a given set of parents, the first and last such eligible siblings will be selected for participation, in the interests of maximizing the variation of time from last exposure to conception, also to maximize the signal (by including offspring closest in time to the exposure, with less likelihood of removal of damaged sperm &#47;oocytes, and by including offspring furthest in time from the exposure, with less likelihood of direct exposure of the child, and maximizing cumulative parental pre-conception gonadal dose). Twins will be especially informative given the comparable exposures in utero and in early life. A high proportion of the trios/quartets currently reside in Kyiv. The majority of these trios&#47;quartets have undergone regular medical examinations as a result of follow-up by the CER. Most of them are expected to be alive.</p> <p>Excluded from the study will be those who cannot be located, those with offspring born within 42 weeks of the last significant Chernobyl-related exposure, those parents or offspring found to have cancer, those who refuse to participate in the study, or who do not provide informed consent.</p>",

    "description": "<p><b>Background and Rationale for the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS)</b><br> Over the last several decades, advances in treatments for childhood and adolescent cancer have substantially improved survival following diagnosis. These improvements gave rise to the responsibility for investigating long-term treatment-associated morbidity and mortality. Early efforts to describe late effects were largely conducted through single-institution and limited consortia studies. However, by the mid-1980s, it became increasingly clear that these approaches had inherent limitations, including small sample size, convenience sampling, incompletely characterized populations, and limited length of follow-up. To overcome these limitations, the CCSS was proposed and funded by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) as a U01 grant in 1994. Subsequently, the strengths of the CCSS, including an efficient and extensive infrastructure, plus expanding database and biorepository, were recognized and appreciated. Thus, in consultation with the NCI, the CCSS was converted to a U24 (resource grant) funding mechanism to serve the scientific community in 2000. <br> The overarching goal of the CCSS resource is to increase the conduct of innovative and high impact research related to pediatric cancer survivorship. CCSS has been used extensively by researchers from a wide range of disciplines to address a broad spectrum of topics. Strengths of the resource include its large size, comprehensive annotation of treatment exposures, ongoing longitudinal follow-up with characterization of a wide array of participant characteristics and outcomes, and an established biorepository.</p> <p><b>Design of the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study</b><br> The Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS) is a multi-institutional, multi-disciplinary collaborative research resource comprised of a retrospective hospital-based cohort of survivors of childhood cancer and a comparison sibling cohort. Eligible survivors from 31 participating institutions were diagnosed between 1970 and 1999, prior to age 21 years, with selected common pediatric cancers (leukemia, central nervous system tumors, Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, kidney tumors, neuroblastoma, soft tissue sarcoma, or bone tumors). All patients who survived five years from the date of diagnosis were eligible, regardless of disease or treatment status. The baseline questionnaire was completed by 25,665 survivors and 5051 siblings recruited to serve as a comparison group. To date, participants have completed three general follow-up surveys, as well as a number of specialized surveys on specific topics (e.g. health care, insurance, screening practices, men's and women's health issues, adolescent health, sleep and fatigue). In addition, biological samples (buccal cells, saliva and/or blood) have been collected for over 11,000 participants. Full descriptions of the design and characteristics of the CCSS have been previously published (Robison et al; Leisenring et al.), and available data and samples are described at <a href=\"https://ccss.stjude.org/develop-a-study/gwas-data-resource.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://ccss.stjude.org/develop-a-study/gwas-data-resource.html.</a> </p> <p><b>Treatment Data in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study</b><br> A key feature of CCSS is the availability of detailed treatment data, which were collected by abstraction of medical records for each individual member of the cohort. Detailed abstraction included dates of therapy, protocol information, and specific details regarding surgery, chemotherapy and radiation. Quantitative dose details were collected for 22 specific chemotherapeutic agents, including alkylating agents, anthracyclines, platinum compounds and epipodophyllotoxins. In addition to individual agent doses, algorithms have been created to calculate cumulative doses of all drugs in a specific class, such as anthracyclines (doxorubicin, daunomycin and idarubicin) or platinum agents (cisplatinum and carboplatinum). Data abstracted for surgeries included dates and both the names and corresponding International Classification of Diseases (9th revision) code. For radiation treatment data, all relevant records were sent to the Radiation Physics Center at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center for detailed abstraction and dosimetry. Initial body region dosimetry was performed for all participants, followed by more detailed dosimetry as needed for specific studies.</p> <p><b>Genomics Data in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study</b><br>The NCI's Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics and CCSS investigators collaborated to conduct genomics studies (SNP array genotyping and whole exome sequencing) using samples from the CCSS Biorepository. Studies included all cohort participants with available DNA regardless of sex or ancestry when the genomics studies were initiated.</p> <p><b>Phenotype Data in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study</b><br> Vital status and cause of death for both participants and non-participants is determined via linkage with the National Death Index (NDI). Identification of subsequent neoplasms is based on self-report, followed by validation using medical records, or via NDI. A wide array of additional health outcomes have been ascertained via a comprehensive set of questions on the CCSS questionnaires, covering potential adverse events across a range of organ systems (hearing/vision/speech, urinary, hormonal, heart and circulatory, respiratory, digestive, brain and nervous systems). In addition to health outcomes, longitudinal data have been collected on demographics, health behaviors, family history, screening practices, insurance status, and a range of psychosocial and neurocognitive factors. A full listing of available variables and copies of the CCSS questionnaires are available at <a href=\"http://ccss.stjude.org\" target=\"_blank\">http://ccss.stjude.org.</a></p> <p><b>Research Areas in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study</b><br> Extensive use by the research community has resulted in over 265 published manuscripts on a wide range of topics, including associations between treatment factors and mortality, subsequent neoplasms, chronic health conditions, cardiac events, neurocognitive sequelae, psychosocial factors, fertility, and health status. Additional topics have included health behaviors, screening practices, health care access and utilization, statistical and exposure assessment methodology, and development of risk prediction models. A full listing of published manuscripts using CCSS data is available on the CCSS website at <a href=\"https://ccss.stjude.org/published-research/publications.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://ccss.stjude.org/published-research/publications.html. </a> </p> <p><b>The Childhood Cancer Survivor Study as a Resource for Investigators</b><br> The CCSS is an NCI-funded resource (U24 CA55727) to promote and facilitate research among long-term survivors of cancer diagnosed during childhood and adolescence. Interested investigators are encouraged to develop research ideas and propose projects within CCSS, whether or not they are from a participating CCSS institution. </p> <p><br></p>",

    "description": "Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome (BWS) is the most common human imprinting disorder and comprises a spectrum of overgrowth phenotypes. While approximately 35% of BWS cases are caused by isolated loss of methylation (LOM) at the human imprinting center 2 (IC2) on chromosome 11p15, only around 5% of patients develop BWS due to structural alterations to the IC2 domain. In this study, we identify a BWS-causing 7.6 kB familial deletion within the IC2 domain by performing Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) on patient-derived human fibroblasts. Using a chromatin conformation capture technique, Capture C, on 3 control fibroblast samples, 3 BWS LOM fibroblast samples, and the single familial deletion sample, we investigate how the domain interactome changes in BWS patients. We find that high-strength interactions occur within the IC2 domain between the 5&#39; end of <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3784\" target=\"_blank\">KCNQ1</a>, KCNQ1 intron 2, and the 5&#39; end of <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1028\" target=\"_blank\">CDKN1C</a> in the control profile that are largely abrogated in the BWS samples, but some lower frequency contacts between the imprinting control region (ICR), KCNQ1 intron 2, and the 5&#39; end of CDKN1C are unaffected. We conclude that the strong KCNQ1-CDKN1C interactions are important in maintaining the domain imprint.",

The study enrolled 1,126 invasive breast cancer cases and 2,106 frequency matched population-based controls using census-based sampling. GHBS participants were between the ages of 18 to 74 years of age. Breast cancer cases were recruited at the time they presented with lesions suspicious of breast cancer at three hospitals: Korle Bu Teaching Hospital (Accra), Komfo Anoyke Teaching Hospital (Kumasi) and Peace and Love Hospital (Kumasi).

    "report_name": "Germline and Somatic Genetic Landscape of Pediatric Rhabdomyosarcoma",
    "description": "Dynamic approaches that integrate population-based research and molecular biology are needed to explain the mechanisms underlying pediatric rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) and to determine novel prevention strategies. RMS, the most common soft-tissue sarcoma in children and adolescents, has one of the poorest 5-year survival rates among all pediatric cancers (less than 65%). One of the strongest risk factors for RMS is having a cancer predisposition syndrome. The syndromes that are most commonly seen among those with RMS are Li-Fraumeni, neurofibromatosis type 1, Costello, Noonan, and DICER1. Based on smaller clinic-based studies, only about 7% of RMS cases are thought to be associated with the genes responsible for these syndromes. However, there have been no population-based assessments to support this estimate. Even in the most recent large-scale evaluations of germline mutations in predisposition genes among children with cancer, very few RMS cases were included (43 cases). Furthermore, no distinctions were made between the major histologic subtypes of RMS: embryonal (eRMS) and alveolar (aRMS), which display differences in terms of age distribution, incidence, and cytogenetics. For instance, nearly 80% of alveolar cases are driven by a chromosomal translocation between either PAX3 or PAX7 and FOXO1, whereas these fusions are not seen in embryonal cases. In fact, RMS research is shifting from categorization based on histology to fusion status (eRMS is overwhelmingly fusion-negative). Another limitation in previous studies has been the inability to evaluate the frequency of de novo germline mutations (DNMs) in cancer predisposition genes due to the absence of any well-characterized cohorts of RMS case-parent trios. Therefore, a major gap in our understanding of the role of cancer predisposition in pediatric RMS that limit translational impact is there have been no population-based assessments to determine the true impact of these mutations on pediatric RMS, which limits clinical sequencing guidelines and surveillance protocols in these children.<br><br>Overall Project Strategy: The objective of this project is to advance our understanding of the relationship between cancer predisposition genes and pediatric RMS. Our central hypotheses are: 1) mutations in cancer predisposition genes are more common than expected in children with RMS; and 2) children with fusion-negative tumors have a higher burden of germline mutations than those with fusion-positive tumors. The framework for this study relies on &gt;600 well annotated samples collected from newly diagnosed RMS patients and stored in the Children&#39;s Oncology Group (COG) Biopathology Center.<br><br>",
    "history": "<p>Compared to other pediatric cancers, the outlook for children with rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) remains poor. In particular, for those with high-risk disease, fewer than 43% of patients survive for more than 5 years. Currently, there are no genetic testing and counseling strategies for children with RMS; there are no clinical surveillance or prevention protocols; and there are few therapeutic targets for this highly fatal tumor. One of the strongest risk factors for RMS is having a genetic cancer predisposition syndrome. While it is believed that about 7% of RMS patients have changes (or mutations) in the genes responsible for these syndromes, there have been no population-based assessments to support this estimate. Because of this, we will leverage the resources of the Children&#39;s Oncology Group, which is supported by the National Cancer Institute and has more than 200 participating institutions throughout the United States and Canada, to obtain over 600 samples from children newly diagnosed with RMS.<br></p>",

    "description": "<p>Myxofibrosarcoma (MFS) and undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS) are highly genetically complex soft tissue sarcomas. Up to 50% of patients develop distant metastases, but current systemic therapies have limited efficacy. MFS and UPS have recently been shown to commonly harbor copy number alterations or mutations in the tumor suppressor genes <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5925\">RB1</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7157\">TP53</a>. As these alterations have been shown to engender dependence on the oncogenic protein Skp2 for survival of transformed cells in mouse models, we sought to examine its function and potential as a therapeutic target in MFS/UPS. Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) and next-generation sequencing (NGS) confirmed that a significant fraction of MFS and UPS patient samples (n=94) harbor chromosomal deletions and/or loss-of-function mutations in RB1 and TP53 (88% carry alterations in at least one gene; 60% carry alterations in both). Tissue microarray (TMA) analysis identified a correlation between absent Rb and p53 expression and positive expression of <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6502\">SKP2</a>. Downregulation of SKP2 or treatment with Skp2 Inhibitor C1 revealed that Skp2 drives proliferation of patient-derived MFS/UPS cell lines deficient in both Rb and p53 by degrading p21 and p27. Inhibition of Skp2 using the neddylation-activating enzyme (NAE) inhibitor pevonedistat decreased growth of Rb/p53-negative patient-derived cell lines and mouse xenografts. These results demonstrate that loss of both Rb and p53 renders MFS and UPS dependent on Skp2, which can be therapeutically exploited and could provide the basis for promising novel systemic therapies for MFS and UPS.</p>",

The OMNI 2.5M genotyping was conducted for 977 prostate cancer cases from UKGPCS. The Exome SNP array genotyping was conducted for 4741 subjects from UKGPCS. The iCOGs genotyping was conducted for 10366 subjects which includes the Multiethnic Cohort (n=1648) and UKGPCS (n=8718).  Below is a description of each study that contributed to the meta-analysis of men of European ancestry. Information about the studies that contributed to the multiethnic meta-analysis can be found on the associated study page and also in Conti et al (Nature Genetics, <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33398198/\" target=\"_blank\">PMID:33398198</a>).&#160;&#160;</p> <p><b>UK GWAS Stage 1 (UK1) and Stage 2 (UK2):\n</b></p><p>The UK Genetic Prostate Cancer Study (UKGPCS) was first established in 1993 and is the largest prostate cancer study of its kind in the UK, involving nearly 189 hospitals. We are based at The Institute of Cancer Research in Sutton, Surrey, and collaborate with the Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust. Our aim is to find genetic changes which are associated with prostate cancer risk. Our target is to recruit 26,000 gentlemen into the UKGPCS by 2017. Men are eligible to take part if they fit into at least one of the following groups: \n</p><p>They have been diagnosed with prostate cancer at 60 years of age or under (up to their 61st birthday).\n</p><p>They have been diagnosed with prostate cancer and a first, second or third degree relative where at least one of these men were diagnosed with prostate cancer at 65 years of age or under.\n</p><p>They are affected and have 3 or more cases of prostate cancer on one side of their family.\n</p><p>They are a prostate cancer patient at the Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust.\n</p><p>We have to date recruited around 16,000 men on whom we have germline DNA and clinical data at diagnosis. \n</p><p>The UK GWAS is based on genotyping of 541,129 SNPs in 1,854 individuals with clinically detected (non-PSA-screened) prostate cancer (cases) and 1,894 controls. 43,671 SNPs showing strong evidence of association in stage 1 were followed up by genotyping a further 3,268 cases and 3,366 controls from UK and Melbourne in stage2. \n</p><p><b>CAPS1 and CAPS2:\n</b></p><p>The CAPS (Cancer of the Prostate in Sweden) study represents a large Swedish population-based cancer study, comprising 3,161 cases and 2,149 controls, recruited between 2001 and 2003. Biopsy confirmed prostate cancer cases were identified and recruited from four out of six regional cancer registries in Sweden, diagnosed between July 2001 and October 2003. Clinical data including TNM stage, Gleason grade and PSA levels at time for diagnosis were retrieved through record linkage to the National Prostate Cancer Registry. Control subjects, who were recruited concurrently with case subjects, were randomly selected from the Swedish Population Registry and matched according to the expected age distribution of cases (groups of 5-year intervals) and geographic region. Whole blood was collected from all individuals for extraction of genomic DNA.  A GWAS was conducted in two parts. In the first phase (CAPS1) 498 cases and 502 controls were genotyped, in the second phase 1,483 cases and 519 controls were genotyped. Genotyping was performed using the GeneChip Human Mapping 500K (CAPS1) and 5.0K (CAPS2) Array Set from Affymetrix (Santa Clara, CA).\n</p><p><b>The National Cancer Institute Breast and Prostate Cancer Cohort Consortium, BPC3:\n</b></p><p>BPC3 was a consortium of prospective cohort studies investigating genetic and gene-environmental risk factors for breast and prostate cancer.  Each study selected cases and controls for this study as described below. The clinical criteria defining advanced prostate cancer (Gleason = 8 or stage C/D) were either obtained from medical records or cancer registries. The Gleason score source was either surgical specimens (radical prostatectomy or autopsy) or the diagnostic biopsy (needle biopsy or TURP). When multiple Gleason scores were available the surgical value was used. PLCO was removed from the analysis as the samples were included in the Pegasus GWAS described below. In total 2,473 advanced prostate cancer cases and 3,534 controls were included in the analysis following QC. \n</p><p><b>\n</b></p><p><b>ATBC, Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention Study:\n</b></p><p>ATBC was a randomized, placebo-controlled primary prevention trial to investigate whether &#945;-tocopherol or &#223;-carotene supplementation reduced the incidence of lung or other cancers in male smokers. Between 1985 and 1988, 29,133 men ages 50 to 69 years were enrolled in the trial from Finland and randomized to supplementation (50 mg &#945;-tocopherol, 20mg &#223;-carotene, or both) or placebo.  Men with a prior history of cancer, other than non-melanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in situ, were excluded from participating. Incident cancer cases are identified through linkage with the Finnish Cancer Registry, which has ~100% ascertainment of cancer cases nationwide. Cases included 249 men diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer (Gleason = 8 or stage C/D) from 1985 to 2003 with DNA available.

Approximately 1.2 million men and women enrolled in the study from 50 states in the U.S. In 1992, a subset of these participants (n= ~184,000) were enrolled in the CPSII Nutrition Cohort to examine the relationship between dietary and other exposures and cancer incidence.  Blood samples were drawn from approximately 39,376 members of the Nutritional Cohort from 1998 to 2001, and buccal cells were collected from 69,467 members from 2001 to 2002. Cancer cases are identified by self-report through follow-up questionnaires followed by verification through medical records and/or linkage to state cancer registries as well as death certificates.  A total of 660 advanced prostate cancer cases (Gleason = 8 or stage III/IV) with a source of DNA were identified for this study.

Study participants were almost all white Europeans. Approximately 500,000 individuals (150,000 men) in EPIC were recruited between 1992 and 2000, from 23 centers in 10 European countries.   Overall approximately 400,000 subjects also provided a blood sample at recruitment.  The methods of recruitment and details of the study design are described in detail elsewhere.  In brief, study participants completed an extensive questionnaire on both dietary and nondietary data at recruitment.  The present study includes subjects from advanced prostate cancer cases (Gleason = 8 or stage III/IV) matched to controls based on study center, length of follow-up, age at enrollment (&#177; 6 months), fasting and time of day of blood collection (&#177; 1 hour).  The advanced prostate cancer subjects were from 8 of the 10 participating countries:  Denmark, Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom (UK).  France and Norway were not included in the current study because these cohorts only included female subjects.  All participants gave written consent for the research and approval for the study was obtained from the ethical review board from all local institutions in the regions where participants had been recruited for the EPIC study.\n</p><p><b>\nHPFS, Health Professionals Follow-up Study:\n</b></p><p>HPFS began in 1986 and is an ongoing prospective cohort study of 51,529 United States male dentists, optometrists, osteopaths, podiatrists, pharmacists, and veterinarians 40 to 75 years of age. The baseline questionnaire provided information on age, marital status, height and weight, ancestry, medications, smoking history, disease history, physical activity, and diet. At baseline the cohort was 97% white, 2% Asian American, and 1% African American. The median follow-up through 2005 was 10.5 years (range 2-19 years). Self-reported prostate cancer diagnoses were confirmed by obtaining medical and/or pathology records. Prostate cancer deaths are either reported by family members in response to follow-up questionnaires, discovered by the postal system, or the National Death Index. Questionnaires are sent every two years to surviving men to update exposure and medical history. In 1993 and 1994, a blood specimen was collected from 18,018 men without a prior diagnosis of cancer. Prostate cancer cases are matched to controls on birth year (+/-1) and ethnicity. Controls are selected from those who are cancer-free at the time of the case&#39;s diagnosis, and had a prostate-specific antigen test after the date of blood draw.&#160;&#160;</p><p><b>\t\n</b></p><p><b>MEC, Multiethnic Cohort:\n</b></p><p>The Multiethnic Cohort Study is a population-based prospective cohort study that was initiated between 1993 and 1996 and includes subjects from various ethnic groups - African Americans and Latinos primarily from Californian (great Los Angeles area) and Native Hawaiians, Japanese-Americans, and European Americans primarily from Hawaii.

Clinical data including TNM stage, Gleason grade and PSA levels at time for diagnosis were retrieved through record linkage to the National Prostate Cancer Registry. Control subjects, who were recruited concurrently with case subjects, were randomly selected from the Swedish Population Registry and matched according to the expected age distribution of cases (groups of 5-year intervals) and geographic region. Whole blood was collected from all individuals for extraction of genomic DNA. A GWAS was conducted in two parts. In the first phase (CAPS1), 498 cases and 502 controls were genotyped, and in the second phase (CAPS2), 1,483 cases and 519 controls were genotyped.

The Gleason score source was either surgical specimens (radical prostatectomy or autopsy) or the diagnostic biopsy (needle biopsy or TURP). When multiple Gleason scores were available, the surgical value was used. Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) cancers were removed from the analysis as the samples were included in the Pegasus GWAS described below. In total, 2,473 advanced prostate cancer cases and 3,534 controls were included in the analysis following QC. </p> <p><b>Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention Study (ATBC):</b><br> ATBC was a randomized, placebo-controlled primary prevention trial to investigate whether a-tocopherol or &#223;-carotene supplementation reduced the incidence of lung or other cancers in male smokers.

    "description": "<p>Testicular germ cell tumors (TGCT) are the most common cancer in men ages 20-40. The incidence of TGCT has more than doubled over the past forty years, without clear etiology. Both genetic effects and environmental exposures, specifically during the pre-natal period, are likely to play an important role in determining TGCT susceptibility. TGCT is known to develop from primordial germ cells (PGCs). We hypothesize that variation in genes that impact upon the differentiation and maturation of PGCs will be important determinants of TGCT susceptibility and based on this hypothesis have selected three important pathways for study, i) male germ cell development, ii) androgen and estrogen biosynthesis and metabolism, and iii) IGF signaling. The proteins involved in early male germ cell development, normally only expressed in PGCs, are markers of and are overexpressed in TGCT. Markers of increased exposure to estrogen (or relatively decreased exposure to androgen) in utero and exogenous estrogen exposures, such as endocrine disruptors, have been associated with TGCT case status in multiple studies. IGF signaling is necessary for testis differentiation and maturation in mice and interacts synergistically with the estrogen signaling pathway. Additionally, we are interested in examining genetic factors predisposing to TGCT in an unbiased fashion, and thus will conduct a Genome Wide Association Study. As well disease susceptiblity, genetics are likely to play a role in disease progression, disease outcomes and response to treatement. We will also assess association of inherited genetics with these outcomes. We will analyze the contribution of genetic variants in these pathways to TGCT risk using a population-based case-control study in the Philadelphia metropolitian area. Our goal is the collection of 550 TGCT cases and 1100 age, race and cell phone use matched controls without a history of TGCT, which will yield 500 and 1000 white cases and controls, respectively, available for final analyses. All cases will be enumerated through the New Jersey and Pennsylvania state cancer registries. We will use a two-tiered approach for case recruitment: hospital clinic-based followed by registry-based. Hospital based cases will be identified within the Univeristy of Pennsylvania Health System and the University of Pennsylvania Cancer Network. All cases identified through this mechanism will be recruited irregardless of diagnosis date. The remaining cases will be identified through the New Jersey and Pennsylvania cancer registries and contacted following their protocols.</p> <p>Controls will be identified through random digit dialing and address based sampling. Both cases and controls will complete a questionnaire addressing known, presumed, and hypothesized risk factors for TGCT and provide a biospecimen. Pathological slides will be reviewed to cases to confirm diagnostic sub-type of TGCT. Haplotypes and functional SNPs will be typed in the genes of interest, as well as throughout the genome. Analyses will be conducted for specific variants, common haplotypes, alone and in conjunction with each other and exposure data after appropriate adjustment for potential confounders. The findings from this study will greatly contribute to our understanding of determinants of TGCT susceptibility.</p>",

    "description": "Two general types of genetic alterations drive cancer progression: mutations and copy number alterations (CNAs). With the exception of p53, single nucleotide variant mutations (here, simply \"mutations\") are not drivers of 80% of tumors within the most frequent and deadly histotype of ovarian cancer: serous ovarian cancer (SOC). Rather, CNAs are more prevalent in SOC than any other cancer type studied by <a href=\"./study.cgi?study_id=phs000178\">phs000178</a> The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Fully two-thirds of genes are altered by CNAs in the average SOC. Bioinformatic methods have shown that these CNAs modulate specific molecular pathways, such as autophagy, and this finding enabled effective pathway-targeted therapies1. Unfortunately, TCGA ovarian cancer data lacks racial diversity. Only 6% of SOC tumors (n=32) studied are from African origin. Black women diagnosed with ovarian cancer are more likely to die from their disease than white women. Five-year survival after diagnosis is 31% among blacks versus 42% among whites, and this disparity is seen in every age group and tumor stage distribution. Dr. Kelemen examined data from 365 white and 95 black ovarian cancer patients from the Hollings Cancer Center (HCC) Cancer Registry between 2000 and 2015 and found that black women had an 81% higher risk of death after diagnosis compared to white women (HR 1.81, 95% CI 1.35-2.43), independent of diagnosis center (98% were treated at HCC but half were diagnosed elsewhere), tumor stage, histology, extent of residual tumor remaining following surgery, insurance status, smoking, type of treatment for ovarian cancer, and age-adjusted Charlson comorbidity index. This disparity remained even when restricted to women who received the standard of care, surgery-chemotherapy sequence (HR 1.79, 95% CI 1.10-2.89). Despite receiving the same treatment, black race was still associated with inferior survival. A similar disparity has been reported by others, indicating that the HCC experience is representative of national data. Here, an additional set of high-grade serous ovarian cancer primary tumors were acquired from biorepositories with a focus on expanding data originating from African American women.

Importantly, one of the JAK1 mutations, despite not being detected in the pre-treatment tumor, was found at low variant allele frequency in the pre-treatment circulating tumor DNA, suggesting clonal selection of the mutation. This report provides the most detailed look yet of defective JAK1 signaling in the context of dMMR and immunotherapy-resistance.

    "description": "<p>CD47 is a cell surface molecule that inhibits phagocytosis of cells that express it by binding to its receptor, SIRP&#945;, on macrophages and other immune cells. CD47 is expressed at different levels in normal cells, however, in cancer cells, CD47 transcript and protein expression is aberrantly increased. Here we sought to uncover the regulators of <i>CD47</i> transcription, including active enhancers that increase its aberrant expression in cancer cells, in order to reveal mechanisms by which different neoplastic cells generate this dominant &#39;don&#39;t eat me&#39; signal. Enhancers are genomic regions, often referred to as \"switches\", that can turn on or off the transcription of target genes. Recently the discovery of super-enhancers (SEs) has given more insight into the regulatory architecture of key genes that are highly expressed in a specific cell type, during a particular developmental stage or in disease. By analyzing the <i>CD47</i> regulatory genomic landscape, we discovered: i) A distinct super-enhancer (SE) is associated with <i>CD47</i> upregulation in breast cancer cells ii) Disruption of <i>CD47</i> SEs by using the BRD4 inhibitor JQ1 robustly reduces <i>CD47</i> gene expression; and iii) The TNF-NFKB1 signaling pathway is directly involved in the regulation of CD47 by interacting with a distal downstream constituent enhancer located within a <i>CD47</i>-associated SE specific to breast cancer. Our results describe a novel mechanism that cancer cells have evolved to drive CD47 overexpression to escape immune surveillance.</p>",

    "description": "<div>The evolution of resistance in high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) cells in response to chemotherapy is only partially understood. To uncover phenotypic changes associated with chemotherapy resistance, we performed single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) or whole-genome sequencing of 23 total patients, with longitudinal samples collected from 9, treatment-na&#239;ve samples from 8 patients, and post-treatment samples from 6 patients.\n</div><div>\n</div><div>Our study revealed that the HGSOC transcriptome could be described using three core archetypal phenotypes, defined as oncogenic tasks that describe majority of the transcriptional data. We implemented a multi-task learning approach to identify the biological tasks of each archetype and identified metabolism and proliferation, cellular defense response, and DNA repair signaling. The &#8220;metabolism and proliferation&#8221; archetype evolved during treatment and was enriched in cancer cells from patients that received multiple-lines of treatment and had elevated tumor burden indicated by CA-125 levels. The emergence of archetypes was not consistently linked to specific whole-genome driver mutations.  However, archetypes were closely associated with sub-clonal clusters at the single-cell level, indicating that cancer cell sub-populations specialize in particular biological tasks.

    "description": "<p>The purpose of this study is to continue the analysis begun on 09C0079 which was focused on identification of the genetic mutation associated with a new gastric polyposis syndrome, Gastric Adenocarcinoma and Proximal Polyposis of the Stomach (GAPPS). GAPPS, first described in 2012, is an autosomal dominant gastric polyposis syndrome that confers a substantial risk for gastric adenocarcinoma. The GAPPS phenotype consists of a carpeting of greater than 100 fundic gland polyps (FGPs) in the oxyntic mucosa of the gastric body and fundus, with antral sparing with some FGPs displaying high-grade dysplasia. This is in contrast to sporadic FGPs that are benign, most often are not associated with high-grade dysplasia though low-grade dysplasia has been reported, and are fewer in number. Gastric FGPs have been found to be associated with Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP) and attenuated FAP, which is an autosomal dominant condition associated with germ line mutations in APC which confers a phenotype consisting of multiple (&gt;100) adenomatous polyps in the colon and rectum developing after the first decade of life. FGPs are reported to occur in 12-84% of patients with FAP, whereas sporadic FGPs are identified in ~5% of patients undergoing upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. Gastric adenocarcinoma arising from FGPs in individuals with FAP have been reported. Other manifestations of FAP and AFAP include polyps in the upper gastrointestinal tract, congenital hypertrophy of retinal pigment epithelium, osteomas and epidermoid cysts, supernumerary teeth, desmoid formation, and other malignancies such as thyroid, small bowel cancer, hepatoblastoma, and medulloblastoma. Thus far there are no reports in GAPPS of polyposis arising in the esophagus, gastric antrum, pylorus, small intestine, or colon.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Understanding the relationship between tumor and peripheral immune environments could allow longitudinal immune monitoring in cancer. Here, we examined whether T cells that share the same TCRab and are found in both tumor and blood can be interrogated to gain insight into the ongoing tumor T cell response. Paired transcriptome and TCRab repertoire of circulating and tumor-infiltrating T cells were analyzed at the single cell level from matched tumor and blood from patients with metastatic melanoma. We found that in circulating T cells matching clonally expanded tumor-infiltrating T cells (circulating TILs), gene signatures of effector functions, but not terminal exhaustion, reflect those observed in the tumor. In contrast, features of exhaustion are displayed predominantly by tumor-exclusive T cells. Finally, genes associated with a high degree of blood-tumor TCR sharing were overexpressed in tumor tissue after immunotherapy. These data demonstrate that circulating TILs have unique transcriptional patterns that may have utility for the interrogation of T cell function in cancer immunotherapy.

Patients may either present prior to surgery with resectable NSCLC, may present following complete resection (before or after adjuvant chemotherapy). Eligibility is limited to those with NSCLC of a non-squamous histological subtype and those with adequate performance status and organ function for future trial eligibility. All subjects must submit tissue for central EGFR and ALK genotyping, as well as additional tissue for advanced genomics at the CCG. Subjects may have had local genotyping done prior to registration, however if these results shows no targetable EGFR or ALK alterations (or if it shows a KRAS mutation) then the patient will not be eligible for this screening protocol given the primary aim is to facilitate accrual to the adjuvant studies. All subjects will provide peripheral blood for matched normal DNA.</p> <p>All subjects (including those known to have EGFR or ALK alterations with local genotyping) will have formalin-fixed tissue collected for central genotyping. The testing will be performed at Response Genetics (Los Angeles, CA), a commercial CLIA-certified laboratory. ALK FISH will be performed using the Vysis break-apart probe and EGFR sequencing will be performed of exons 18-21. It is preferred that a full tumor block be submitted, but if unavailable, 15 unstained slides can be submitted. Genotyping results are expected to be provided to the treating clinician within 14 business days of submission so they can be used to determine eligibility for the randomized adjuvant studies, or to confirm the local results. Results will also be reported at intervals to the study team for update into the Alliance database.</p> <p>In addition to the commercial genotyping at Response Genetics, tissue will be collected for research genomics by CCG. For those patients with a block available, this will be forwarded to the CCG after clinical testing at Response Genetics. For patients without a block available, 15 unstained slides should be submitted to the CCG BCR for exploratory analysis. A peripheral blood specimen will also be collected and sent to the CCG BCR to use as matched normal. Specimens will be coded. Over the course of the study, the CCG will perform advanced genomic analysis of the resected lung cancer specimens in a research, non-CLIA environment. Following completion of the genomic analysis, the results can be matched with the clinical follow-up results using a link between the samples codes and the patient identifiers for correlative analyses.</p> <p>Subjects participating in the follow-up portion of the ALCHEMIST study, as well as those participating in the adjuvant therapeutic studies, are expected to undergo a standard-of-care diagnostic biopsy to confirm recurrence. At least two core biopsies, minimum, should be obtained as part of this recurrence biopsy. Paraffin embedded tissue from this biopsy will be used for confirmation of recurrence, for CLIA genomics to plan subsequent clinical trials, and for additional research genomics by the CCG. Plasma will additionally be collected at recurrence and sent to CCG for study of circulating free DNA (cfDNA).</p> <p>Data for the ALCHEMIST study is not yet available to be accessed by the public at this time; when ready it will be made available at the GDC Data Portal.</p>",

    "report_name": "Methylation biomarker study of magnesium deficiency and colorectal cancer",
    "description": "<p>Five US studies using the Mg tolerance test, the \"gold standard\" test of Mg status, indicated that &gt;50% participants had Mg deficiency. In our ongoing US trial, we have found a similar result. In growing recognition of the importance of Mg in human health, very recently, Mg was selected by the US Federal Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) Committee to update the DRI. In US and other populations at high risk of Mg deficiency, high Mg intake has been linked to reduced risk of colorectal neoplasia, insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Conversely, in populations not at high risk of Mg deficiency, high Mg intake has been related to increased risk of total mortality (e.g. total cancer, colorectal cancer, and CVD), particularly when calcium intake is low. These observations suggest that the associations between high Mg intake and disease risks may completely differ by the underlying Mg status. Due to major limitations, the Mg tolerance test is not used in conventional clinical practice and rarely used in research. Instead, serum Mg is used for clinical diagnosis. However, serum Mg performs very poorly at identifying those with Mg deficiency. There is a great need to develop implementable, sensitive, and specific biomarkers which can be easily used for identifying people with Mg deficiency. Without such a marker, it is impossible to develop effective strategies that minimize adverse effects by targeting those who, as a result of Mg deficiency, are at risk of common diseases. It is known that DNA methylation changes are inducible by environmental exposures, including nutrients, and reversible when the exposure disappears. There are two major types of cytosine modifications in DNA, 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) and 5-methylcytosine (5-mC). 5-mC is often associated with suppressed gene expression. 5-hmC, generated by the oxidation of 5-mC, is specifically enriched in expressed genes and plays a critical role in activating and/or maintaining gene expression. However, current epigenomic profiling platforms cannot distinguish 5-hmC from 5-mC. Just recently, our collaborator, Dr. Chuan He (HHMI Investigator), established a novel and state of the art technique, TAB-Seq and TAB-Array protocol, which can separate 5-hmC from 5-mC in the genome. Our pilot studies indicate that Mg intake or treatment significantly affects methylation capacity, 5-mC and 5-hmC biomarkers. Our findings suggest blood leukocyte 5-hmC/5-mC biomarkers may serve as more sensitive biomarkers to identify Mg deficiency than serum Mg. Thus, a comprehensive epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) may help to identify the most sensitive 5-hmC/ 5- mC biomarkers for Mg deficiency. We propose to identify 5-hmC/5-mC biomarkers for Mg deficiency by a 4- phase EWAS study in the \"Personalized Prevention of Colorectal Cancer Trial [PPCCT, R01CA149633; PI, Dai and Yu]\" with a total of 240 participants. Mg tolerance test will be used as the gold standard. Finally, using newly identified biomarkers, we will evaluate if 12-week Mg treatment reduces TRPM7 expression, essential in Mg homeostasis and colorectal carcinogenesis, in rectal tissues only among those with Mg deficiency.</p>",

The ability to detect somatic mutations in plasma depends on both assay sensitivity and the fraction of circulating DNA in plasma that is tumor-derived (i.e cfDNA tumor fraction). We hypothesized that cfDNA tumor fraction could inform the interpretation of negative cfDNA results and guide the choice of subsequent assays of greater genomic breadth or depth. Plasma samples collected from 118 metastatic cancer patients were analyzed with cf-IMPACT, a modified version of the FDA-authorized MSK-IMPACT tumor test that can detect genomic alterations in 410 cancer-associated genes. Shallow whole genome sequencing (sWGS) was also performed in the same samples to estimate cfDNA tumor fraction based on genome-wide copy number alterations using z-score statistics. The results show that cfDNA tumor fraction can inform the interpretation of negative cfDNA results and guide the selection of subsequent sequencing platforms that are most likely to identify clinically-relevant  genomic alterations.</p><p><br></p>",

However, it is not a uniform disease and includes several genetic subtypes with different prognoses. ccRCC is also characterized by distinguished metabolic reprogramming. Tobacco smoking (TS) is an established risk factor for ccRCC with unknown effects on tumor pathobiology.<br><br><b>Methods</b>. We investigated the landscape of ccRCCs and paired normal kidney tissues (NKTs) using integrated transcriptomic, metabolomic and metallomic approaches in a cohort of never smokers (NS) and long-term current smokers (LTS) Caucasian males. <br><br><b>Results</b>. All three Omics domains consistently identified a distinct metabolic subtype of ccRCCs in LTS, characterized by activation of oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) coupled with reprogramming of the malate-aspartate shuttle and metabolism of aspartate, glutamate, glutamine and histidine. Cadmium, copper and inorganic arsenic accumulated in LTS tumors showing redistribution among intracellular pools, including relocation of copper into the cytochrome c oxidase complex. Gene expression signature based on the LTS metabolic subtype provided prognostic stratification of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) ccRCC tumors that was independent from genomic alterations.<br><br><b>Conclusions</b>. The work identified the TS related metabolic subtype of ccRCC with vulnerabilities that can be exploited for precision medicine approaches targeting metabolic pathways. The results provided rationale for the development of metabolic biomarkers with diagnostic and prognostic applications using evaluation of OxPhos status. The metallomic analysis revealed the role of disrupted metal homeostasis in ccRCC highlighting the importance of studying effects of metals from e-cigarettes and environmental exposures.<br><br>",

    "description": "<p>Mammographic density (MD) is a strong risk factor for breast cancer and is also a highly heritable trait with &#126;60-70% of the variance due to genetic factors, based on twin studies. MD is also higher in families with a strong history of breast cancer. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS), which focus on common genetic variants, have identified several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with MD. However, these SNPs explain a very small fraction of the variance of MD, suggesting many other genes are involved. Thus, the vast majority of the heritability of mammographic density remains unexplained and may be explained, at least in part, by rare variants.</p> <p>Ashkenazi Jewish women are a founder population; founder populations frequently have alleles affecting phenotypes which may be unique and/or extremely rare in other populations. Prior reports have identified an association between higher mammographic density and Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry. Therefore, we developed a study of mammographic density in AJ women. We combined datasets from several different cohorts including (a) the California Pacific Medical Center Research Institute (b) the Athena Breast Health Cohort and (c) the Marin Women&#39;s study. In each study, we identified women who reported AJ ancestry (determined by self-report or by genetic analysis). We identified mammograms by linking the women to the San Francisco Mammography Registry. We retrieved digital mammographic results and used software to infer volumetric density and percent volumetric density for each woman. We then performed genome-wide genotyping of the samples using the Illumina MEGA array.</p>",

The diagnosis of PTCL includes diverse lymphoma subgroups, altogether accounting for about 15% of all non-Hodgkin lymphomas. Despite recent advances in uncovering the mutational landscape of PTCLs, the prognoses of most PTCLs remain poor. To overcome the limits of exome sequencing and identify new genomic abnormalities in PTCL, we performed RNAseq and whole genome sequencing.</p> <p>From our analyses, we identified a recurrent in-frame deletion (VAV1 &#916;778-786) generated by a focal deletion-driven alternative splicing mechanism as well as novel VAV1 gene fusions (VAV1-THAP4, VAV1-MYO1F, and VAV1-S100A7). These genetic lesions result in increased activation of VAV1 catalytic-dependent (MAPK, JNK) and non-catalytic-dependent (nuclear factor of activated T cells, NFAT) VAV1 effector pathways. These results support an oncogenic role for VAV1 signaling in the pathogenesis of PTCL (Abate et al., 2017).</p> <p>Recently, we have also identified a novel chimeric oncogene, FYN-TRAF3IP2, in the RNA-seq and whole genome sequencing analyses.

Total of 2199 case patients and 1103 non cancer controls were genotyped. Case patients are defined as patients with pathological or radiological diagnosis of HCC with and without chronic hepatitis C virus infection. Study was restricted to Caucasian population without prior infection with chronic HBV infection. All DNA samples were extracted from peripheral blood. Study population of the participated sites are:</p> <p><u><b>Site-1: University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center </b></u><br> A hospital based-case-control study was initiated at UT MD Anderson Cancer Center in 2000 and approved by the Institutional Review Board of The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center. Study design was previously described in detailed (1-3). Written informed consent for an interview and for a biological sample was obtained from each participant. At time of diagnosis prior to treatment exposure. Case patients were recruited from the population of patients with newly diagnosed HCC who were evaluated and treated at the institution's gastrointestinal medical and surgical oncology outpatient clinics. Inclusion criteria were as follows: a pathologically confirmed diagnosis of HCC, U.S. residency, and the ability to communicate in English. Patients with concurrent or past history of other types of cancers were excluded. Control subjects were healthy spouses of patients with cancers other than liver, gastrointestinal, lung, or head and neck (smoking-related cancers) undergoing treatment at our institution. Eligibility criteria for control subjects were the same as those for patients, except that control subjects could not have ever had cancer. A short, structured questionnaire was used to screen potential control subjects on the basis of eligibility criteria. Control subjects and patients were recruited simultaneously. Case patients and control subjects were interviewed by well-trained interviewers who followed a written protocol to guide ascertainment and reduce surveillance, interviewer, and recall bias. No proxy interviews were conducted. The interviewers used a structured and validated questionnaire to collect information about demographic characteristics and potential risk factors for HCC such as personal smoking history, alcohol use, medical history, occupational history, and family history of cancer. Blood samples from cases and controls were tested for HBV and HCV. HCV antibodies, hepatitis B surface antigen, and antibodies to hepatitis B core antigen were detected by use of a third-generation enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, IL). Important clinical information were retrieved from patients' medical records. Total of 1188 case patients and 278 controls from MD Anderson study were genotyped. </p> <p><b><u>Site-2: Mayo Clinic</u></b><br> Case patients and controls included in the study from Mayo clinic were recruited as part of Mayo International Hepatobiliary Neoplasia Register and Biorepository. Only USA patients and controls were participated. All cases and controls signed informed consent indicating their willingness to participate in genetic studies. Epidemiological and clinical data were collected from participants and retrieved from medical records. Total of 522 HCC case patients and 182 controls were genotyped in this study. </p> <p><b><u>Site-3: Toronto University </u></b><br> Molecular Epidemiology of Hepatobiliary Tumors (HBT study, CAPCR 09-0289) is a hospital-based study that includes 1710 patients diagnosed with liver, bile duct or gallbladder adenocarcinoma (Hepatocellular carcinoma - HCC; cholangiocarcinoma - CCA; and gall bladder adenocarcinoma -GBCa) recruited at University Health Network (UHN) between 2009 and 2018. HBT study is a prospective study of cancer patients that collects self-reported demographic and epidemiological data, medical records/clinical information and blood samples for research purposes. Eligible patients recruited between 2009 and March 15 2016 were selected to participate in the Genome-Wide Association Study in Patients with Hepatocellular Carcinoma (GWAS in HCC, CAPCR 15-9943-CE), a sub-study of the HBT study. Eligible prospective patients recruited after March 15 2016 signed the Addendum to the HBT consent form and became eligible to participate in the GWAS in HCC study. Total of 271 cases and 21 controls were genotyped from Toronto University </p> <p><u><b>Site-4: University of Pittsburgh</b></u><br> The design of the study has been described previously (4-6). Briefly, this population-based study enrolled 120 HCC patients and 230 matched controls from black, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic white residents of Los Angeles County who were between 18 and 74 years of age at diagnosis from January 1995 through December 2001. HCC Cases were identified through the Los Angeles County Cancer Surveillance Program. We sought to recruit up to two control subjects per case from the neighborhoods where HCC patients resided at the time of diagnosis, who were matched to the index case by sex, age (within 5 years), and race (Hispanic white, non-Hispanic white, black). Blood samples (plasma and buffy coat), medical and lifestyle factors were collected from all consenting participants. Total of 65 cases and 60 controls were genotyped in this study </p> <p><u><b>Site-5: University of Texas, Southwestern (Dallas)</b></u><br> Under IRB approval, HCC Cases and controls were prospectively collected since 2015 from the outpatient Liver clinics from Parkland Health and Hospital System and UT Southwestern Medical Center, two large health systems in Dallas TX. A Total of 31 cases and 29 controls were genotyped from site 5. </p> <p><u><b>Site-6: Columbia University </b></u><br> HCC patients from Columbia are those recruited as part of the Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center Database Shared Resource which seeks to recruit all cancer patients for potential future studies. The PI is Dr. Katherine Crew AAAL5871. This resource collects sociodemographic, lifestyle and clinical data on patients as well as a blood sample. Those who indicated on their consent form that they would participate in genetic studies were included. Total of 79 case patients with HCC were genotyped from Columbia University. </p> <p><u><b>Site-7: University of Michigan </b></u><br> The study population included from University of Michigan were included from a prospective study of with chronic HCV infection recruited in Ann Arbor Patients who had under- gone liver transplantation, known coinfection with HIV, life expectancy &lt;12 months due to extra-hepatic illnesses, or were receiving HCV treatment at enrolment, were excluded. Protocol, surveys, and data forms were developed where each enrolled patient completed the same questionnaire All patients provided written informed consent before enrolment in the study. The study was approved by the institutional review board or ethics committee at the University of Michigan. Detailed study description was previously published (7). Total of 44 cases and 347 controls were genotyped </p> <p><u><b>Site-8: Veteran Administration Medical Center in Houston </b></u><br> This research including written informed consent form was jointly approved by Institutional Review Boards for the Baylor College of Medicine and the Michael E.

The severity of peripheral neuropathy was assessed on a scale of 1-4 according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3. Additionally, patient-reported neurotoxicity was also recorded during the trial using the FACT/GOG Neurotoxicity Subscale survey and was reported weekly. Each item on the survey was ranked on a qualitative scale from \"Not at all\" to \"Very much\", where the first four items are specifically defined for sensory peripheral neuropathy.

    "description": "<p>Colorectal cancer remains one of the most common cancers in the US with 146,970 new diagnoses and 49,920 deaths estimated for 2009. Colon cancer is also one of the most familial of cancers. Individuals with a first-degree relative with colon cancer have a 2- to 3-fold increased risk, and those with more than one first-degree relative with colon cancer, or a single first-degree relative affected at age 50 years, have a 3- to 6-fold greater risk than those with no family history. The most prominent high-risk colorectal cancer susceptibility genes, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/324\">APC</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4292\">MLH1</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4436\">MSH2</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2956\">MSH6</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5728\">PTEN</a>, were all discovered more than a decade ago. Currently, mutation screening of these genes, plus a short list of additional genes that are responsible for a very small fraction of colorectal cancer, plays an important role in the clinical management of individuals with a strong family history of the disease or syndromic evidence for the presence of a gene mutation.</p> <p>At the other end of the risk spectrum, genome-wide association studies have identified a number of common alleles with very modest effects on colorectal cancer risk; their clinical utility has yet to be established. However, taken together, the known spectrum of genetic effects only explain about one quarter of the overall familial excess of colorectal cancer. It should be emphasized that, at present, the vast majority of individuals seen at familial cancer clinics are counseled on the basis of their family history alone because they do not have mutations in the known susceptibility genes. Accordingly, the long-term objective of this project is to identify the majority of genes responsible for the unexplained component of inherited colorectal cancer risk. Nextgen DNA sequencing is well suited for application to research questions in genetic susceptibility for which linkage analysis is confounded by extensive genetic heterogeneity. Taking advantage of unparalleled familial cancer genetics resources available through the Utah Population Database, candidate genes have been identified by sequencing all of the gene exons in the human genome from a series of colorectal cancer cases with a very strong family history of colorectal cancer not explained by one of the currently known high-risk susceptibility genes.</p>",
    "history": "<p>Subjects originate from among 35 multi-case high-risk colon cancer pedigrees ascertained through the Utah Population Database (UPDB). Cases consisted of pairs of affected first cousins or affected first cousins-once-removed where each subject of the pair also had a first-degree relative diagnosed with colon cancer. Cases were removed when genotypes failed to confirm when genotyped on an Illumina Infinium OmniExpressExome SNP array. Cases were those free from pathogenic variants in any of a panel of 28 known or suspected susceptibility genes.</p>",

We used single-cell RNA sequencing on patient tumors and matched blood, and we uncovered a previously unappreciated, complex environment of immune-suppressive cellular interactions. These experiments reveal immune checkpoint expression heterogeneity on individual patient T cells, with corresponding ligands on neoplastic and myeloid cells. TIGIT was upregulated on tumor infiltrating CD8+ T cells and was the only checkpoint receptor consistently expressed by exhausted CD8+ T cells. Clinical annotation of the samples revealed that the exhausted signature is most prominent in patients with advanced stages of disease. Our findings suggest individualized combination therapy, involving anti-TIGIT therapies, may be necessary to extend the benefits of immunotherapy to pancreatic cancer patients.</p>",

    "description": "<p>As the most common malignancy of the endocrine system, thyroid cancer is classified into two major categories, non-medullary thyroid cancer (NMTC) and medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) according to the origins and clinical features. NMTC includes papillary thyroid cancer (PTC), follicular thyroid cancer (FTC), and anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC). Sporadic non-medullary thyroid cancer (SNMTC) accounts for &#126;90% of all thyroid cancers. Compared to SNMTC, familial non-medullary thyroid cancer (FNMTC) is rare, constituting only 3 - 9%. FNMTC is a complex genetic disease that often shows an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance. Characterization of the germline variants causing the disease is still challenging given the heterogeneity of affected families.</p> <p>In recent years, some mutations in known cancer susceptive coding genes have been reported using targeted DNA sequencing method in FNMTC cases. Still, little is known for the novel mutations in other thyroid cancer predisposition genes. With the decreasing cost and rapid development of next generation sequencing technology, more rare germline mutations underlying different types of cancer susceptibility in families had been discovered by whole genome sequencing (WGS). In this study, we performed WGS in familial NMTC patients in the U.S. Our aim is to identify rare germline variants with high penetrance that may contribute to thyroid cancer predisposition in NMTC families.</p>",

    "description": "<p><b>PURPOSE</b><br/> Whole-genome profiles of the epigenetic modification 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) are robust diagnostic biomarkers in adult patients with cancer. We investigated if 5-hmC profiles would serve as novel prognostic markers in neuroblastoma, a clinically heterogeneous pediatric cancer. Because this DNA modification facilitates active gene expression, we hypothesized that 5-hmC profiles would identify transcriptomic networks driving the clinical behavior of neuroblastoma. </p> <p><b>PATIENTS AND METHODS</b><br/> Nano-hmC-Seal sequencing was performed on DNA from Discovery (n &#61; 51), Validation (n &#61; 38), and Children&#39;s Oncology Group (n &#61; 20) cohorts of neuroblastoma tumors. RNA was isolated from 48 tumors for RNA sequencing. Genes with differential 5-hmC or expression between clusters were identified using DESeq2. A 5-hmC model predicting outcome in high-risk patients was established using linear discriminant analysis. </p> <p><b>RESULTS</b><br/> Comparison of low- versus high-risk tumors in the Discovery cohort revealed 577 genes with differential 5-hmC. Hierarchical clustering of tumors from the Discovery and Validation cohorts using these genes identified two main clusters highly associated with established prognostic markers, clinical risk group, and outcome. Genes with increased 5-hmC and expression in the favorable cluster were enriched for pathways of neuronal differentiation and KRAS activation, whereas genes involved in inflammation and the PRC2 complex were identified in the unfavorable cluster. The linear discriminant analysis model trained on high-risk Discovery cohort tumors was prognostic of outcome when applied to high-risk tumors from the Validation and Children&#39;s Oncology Group cohorts (hazard ratio, 3.8). </p> <p><b>CONCLUSION</b><br/> 5-hmC profiles may be optimal DNA-based biomarkers in neuroblastoma. Analysis of transcriptional networks regulated by these epigenomic modifications may lead to a deeper understanding of drivers of neuroblastoma phenotype. </p> <p>&#34;Reprinted from Applebaum et.

    "description": "<p>Squamous cell carcinoma in situ (SCCIS) is a prevalent precancerous lesion that can progress to cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC). Although SCCIS is common, its pathogenesis remains poorly understood. To better understand SCCIS development, we performed laser-captured microdissection of human SCCIS and adjacent epidermis to isolate genomic DNA and RNA for next generation sequencing. Whole exome sequencing (WES) identified UV-signature mutations in multiple genes including Notch 1-3 (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=4851\">GeneID:4851</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=4853\">GeneID:4853</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=4854\">GeneID:4854</a>) in the epidermis and SCCIS and oncogenic TP53 (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=7157\">GeneID:7157</a>) mutations in SCCIS. Novel gene families, including SCHLAFEN genes, contained UV/oxidative-signature disruptive (UVD) epidermal mutations that manifested positive selection in SCCIS. The frequency and distribution of NOTCH and TP53 mutations indicate that NOTCH mutations may precede TP53 mutations. </p> <p>RNA sequencing identified 1166 differentially expressed genes; the top 5 enriched GO biological processes included: 1) immune response, 2) epidermal development, 3) protein phosphorylation, 4) regulation of catalytic activity, and 5) cytoskeletal regulation. The NEURL1 ubiquitin ligase, which targets Notch ligands for degradation, was upregulated in SCCIS. Neuralized 1 protein was found to be elevated in SCCIS suggesting that increased levels could represent a novel mechanism for downregulating Notch during UV-induced carcinogenesis. The data from DNA and RNA sequencing of epidermis and SCCIS provide insights regarding SCCIS formation. </p>",

CFM comprises a variable phenotype and the most common features include malformations of the ear (i.e. microtia) and lower jaw (i.e. mandibular hypoplasia) on one or both sides. Microtia in the absence of other anomalies is believed to represent the mildest form of CFM. The cause of CFM is unknown for most affected individuals.

    "description": "Mutations that drive oncogenesis in cancer can generate neoantigens that may be recognized by the immune system. Identification of these neoantigens remains challenging due to the complexity of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigen and T-cell receptor interaction. Here we describe the development of a systematic approach to efficiently identify and validate immunogenic neoantigens. Whole exome sequencing of tissue from a melanoma patient was used to identify nonsynonymous mutations, followed by MHC binding prediction and identification of tumor clonal architecture. The top 18 putative class I neoantigens were selected for immunogenicity testing via a novel <i>in vitro</i> pipeline in HLA-A201 healthy donor blood. Naive CD8 T cells from donors were stimulated with allogeneic dendritic cells pulsed with peptide pools and then with individual peptides. The presence of antigen-specific T cells was determined via functional assays. We identified one putative neoantigen that expanded T cells specific to the mutant form of the peptide and validated this pipeline in a subset of patients with bladder tumors treated with durvalumab (N = 5). Within this cohort, the top predicted neoantigens from all patients were immunogenic <i>in vitro</i>. Finally, we looked at overall survival in the whole durvalumab-treated bladder cohort (N = 37) by stratifying patients by tertile measure of tumor mutation burden (TMB) or neoantigen load. Patients with higher neoantigen and TMB load tended to show better overall survival.",

    "description": "<p>A case-control study was designed with 80 participants diagnosed with Barrett's Esophagus (BE) selected from a larger case-cohort study (Li et al., 2014, PMID: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24253313\" target=\"_blank\">24253313</a>) within the Seattle Barrett's Esophagus Program (SBEP) at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. The study included 40 cases with BE with non-cancer outcomes, \"NCO\", who did not progress to esophageal adenocarcinoma (EA), and 40 controls who progressed to an endoscopically detected, incident EA (cancer outcome, \"CO\"). For each patient, two timepoints were evaluated (T1 and T2). NCO were matched to CO based on age at T1 (T1=first endoscopy with sufficient sample availability), and time between T1 and T2 (T2 in CO=time of diagnosis of incident EA). In 10 NCO, a third time point (T3), a mean of 13.2 years after T1, was also sequenced. Mapped endoscopic biopsies, at 1/3 and 2/3 annotated distances from the gastroesophageal junction within the Barrett's segment, were sampled per patient at each timepoint. Each biopsy was purified to separate BE epithelium from stroma, and DNA was extracted from purified epithelium for 60X WGS and 2.5M SNP array; normal control blood (N=62) or normal gastric sample (N=18) were analyzed by 30X WGS and 2.5M SNP array. An additional seven normal gastric biopsy samples in seven patients with normal control blood were also sequenced at 60X as controls.</p> <p>All research participants contributing clinical data and esophageal samples to this study provided written informed consent, subject to oversight by the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center IRB Committee D (Reg ID 5619).</p>",
    "history": "<p>The Seattle Barrett's Esophagus Study (SBES), which was founded in 1983 as a prospective observational cohort study of patients with Barrett's esophagus (BE), and now comprises more than 1000 patients and includes a biorepository of biospecimens and associated clinical and epidemiologic data. BE is the only known precursor to esophageal adenocarcinoma (EA), which has an estimated annual incidence of 0.5% to 1.0%, yet BE is primarily an indolent disease that will not progress to cancer during the lifetime of most patients. However the incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma is known to be increasing at an alarming rate in many western countries, rising nearly 600% in the US over the three decades from 1972 - 2002. The overarching goals of the SBES are to (1) reduce morbidity and mortality of EA by early detection, prevention, or both and (2) elucidate mechanisms of human neoplastic progression in vivo that may be shared by other neoplasms whose early stages are less amenable to investigation. The study has over 35 years of experience in early translational research studies as defined by the <a href=\"https://deainfo.nci.nih.gov/advisory/ncab/workgroup/archive/TRWG/FinalReport2007.pdf\">NCI Translational Research Working Group</a>.</p>",
    "inclusion_criteria": "<p>Inclusion criteria included &#8805; 2 endoscopies each with &#8805; 3 cm segment of BE and none of the following interventions: no endoscopic mucosal resection, radio frequency ablation, photodynamic therapy, or esophageal surgical resection. Cases (\"cancer outcome\") were defined as participants who progressed to diagnosis of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EA), N=40. Controls (\"non-cancer outcome\") were defined as those who did not progress to EA during follow-up. For each case, controls were randomly selected using matching criteria of baseline total somatic chromosomal alterations (SCA) from (Li et al., 2014, PMID: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24253313\" target=\"_blank\">24253313</a>) and time between timepoints T1 and T2. T1 was defined as either the baseline (N=5) or the baseline+1 (N=75) endoscopy, depending on tissue availability. T2 was defined as endoscopy during which EA was initially diagnosed for cancer outcome patients, or the endoscopy selected for matched follow-up time for non-cancer outcome patients.</p>",

Main outcome of interest is disease-free survival in patients with wild-type KRAS mutations, while secondary end points included overall survival and toxicity.</p> <p>N9741: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of various combination chemotherapy regimens in treating patients who have advanced, recurrent, or metastatic colorectal cancer that cannot be treated with surgery or radiation therapy.</p> <p>C-08: A Phase III Clinical Trial Comparing Infusional 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU), Leucovorin, and Oxaliplatin (mFOLFOX6) Every Two Weeks With Bevacizumab to the Same Regimen Without Bevacizumab For the Treatment of Patients With Resected Stages II and III Carcinoma of the Colon. The primary aim of the trial was to compare the relative efficacy of mFOLFOX6 &#43; bevacizumab with that of mFOLFOX6 alone in prolonging disease-free survival and the secondary aim was to compare the relative efficacy of mFOLFOX6 &#43; bevacizumab with that of mFOLFOX6 alone in prolonging survival.</p>",

    "description": "<p><i>(Excerpted/paraphrased from original grant application)</i>: FOCI seeks to expand our understanding of epithelial ovarian cancer through a coordinated and comprehensive approach. Project 1 will focus on discovery, expansion, and replication. By pooling GWAS, we expect to identify new associations and achieve independent replication, explore whether there are risk variants specific for histologic subtypes, and evaluate structural polymorphisms - copy number variants - as risk factors. Finally, Project 1 will leverage the GWAS data to correlate DNA variants with a new endpoint - survival. Project 2 will focus on biological studies designed to help inform interpretation of findings from Project 1. This will include efforts to identify the functional consequences of variants and improve understanding of biological mechanisms. Project 3 will include epidemiologic studies of gene by gene interaction, gene by environment interaction, and development of risk prediction models. The collective effort builds upon the strengths and history of collaboration inherent in the Ovarian Cancer Association Consortium (OCAC), a multidisciplinary group comprised of epidemiologists, genetic epidemiologists, statistical geneticists, molecular and cell biologists and clinicians that was formed in 2005.</p> <p><b>The FOCI Cohort is utilized in the following dbGaP sub-studies.</b> To view genotypes, other molecular data, and derived variables collected in these sub-studies, please click on the following sub-studies below or in the \"Sub-studies\" box located on the right hand side of this top-level study page <a href=\"study.cgi?study_id=phs001133\">phs001133</a> FOCI Cohort. <ul> <li><a href=\"study.cgi?study_id=phs001131\">phs001131</a> Affymetrix Exome Chip</li> <li><a href=\"study.cgi?study_id=phs001132\">phs001132</a> GWAS Meta Analysis</li> <li><a href=\"study.cgi?study_id=phs001142\">phs001142</a> Mayo Omni Express</li> <li><a href=\"study.cgi?study_id=phs001150\">phs001150</a> Mayo 2 5M</li> </ul> </p>",

    "description": "<p>Myeloid malignancies have previously been characterized by large scale bulk molecular profiling studies on patient samples. These studies, while clinically informative, are unable to delineate mutation order as well as clonal architecture and complexity. To investigate the clonal framework of myeloid malignancies, the Single Cell Mutational Profiling in Myeloid Malignancies study was designed. This study performed sequencing of 148 samples from 117 adult patients diagnosed with clonal hematopoiesis (n = 21), myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN; n = 14), and acute myeloid leukemia (AML; n = 82) between 20 and 87 years of age. Sequencing of all samples was performed using the Tapestri single cell DNA sequencing platform from Mission Bio, Inc. The platform utilizes a custom amplicon panel covering 109 amplicons across 31 genes frequently mutated in myeloid malignancies (CH, MPN, AML). Using the single cell DNA sequencing data, we were capable of elucidating clonal architecture and clonal complexity in each sample. In a subset of samples, we also performed simultaneous single cell DNA sequencing and cell surface protein expression analysis using the Tapestri DNA + Protein platform. This study allowed us to determine the expression of 7 cell surface proteins (CD3, CD11b, CD19, CD34, CD38, CD45RA, and CD90) at single cell resolution. We performed DNA+ Protein sequencing on samples from CH patients (n = 7) as well as AML patients (n = 17).</p>",

Single point variants and short insertions/deletions not identified in database of known non-somatic variants (dbSNP and 1000 genomes) were included in analysis. Samples were selected based on mutation coverage by the Mission Bio Custom amplicon panel with variant allele frequencies of all covered mutations being &gt;5% by bulk sequencing.

    "description": "<p>Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a tumor-predisposition disorder caused by germline mutations in <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=4763\">NF1</a>. NF1 patients have an 8-16% lifetime risk of developing a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST), a highly aggressive soft-tissue sarcoma, often arising from pre-existing benign plexiform neurofibromas (PN) and atypical neurofibromas (ANF). ANF are distinct from both PN and MPNST, representing an intermediate step in malignant transformation. In the first comprehensive genomic analysis of ANF, we performed tumor/normal exome sequencing (ES) of 16 ANFs. In addition, we conducted ES of three MPNSTs, copy-number meta-analysis of 26 ANF and 28 MPNST, and whole transcriptome RNA-seq analysis of five ANF and five MPNST.

Further progression from ANF to MPNST likely involves broad chromosomal rearrangements and frequent inactivation of the PRC2 genes, loss of the DNA repair genes, and copy-number increase of signal transduction, cell cycle and pluripotency self-renewal genes.</p>",

However, predictors of response to these therapies in RCC are still unknown. Genomic characterization of large clinical cohorts of patients treated with anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 agents in melanoma and NSCLC have suggested that high mutational burden, high neoantigen burden, and high expression of certain genes in pre-treatment tumors may be associated with patient response to these therapies.

    "description": "<p><strong>Background and Hypotheses:</strong> Mongolia has the highest reported incidence of - and mortality from - hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the world, which is between three and seven times higher than that observed in other high-incidence populations, such as South Korea, Thailand, and China. Although its causative factors and underlying tumor biology remain unknown, risk factors such as chronic hepatitis B virus and/or hepatitis C virus infection are highly prevalent. Moreover, Mongolia has an extraordinarily high prevalence of hepatitis delta virus (HDV), more than ten times above the global estimate, which we hypothesize as a major driver of Mongolian hepatocarcinogenesis. By performing a comprehensive and integrative genomic characterization, we aimed to identify robust molecular subclasses and driver features informative of the etiology and progression of the disease. This study, the first one of this nature ever to be conducted on a Mongolian cohort, identifies similarities to previous studies performed on other populations (which reflect general characteristics of liver carcinogenesis) as well as unique features of Mongolian HCC.</p> <p><strong>Study Design and Methods:</strong> Clinical information and paired tumor/non-tumor liver tissue samples were obtained from 76 HCC patients undergoing surgery at the National Cancer Center of Mongolia. Transcriptome sequencing and whole exome sequencing were performed on all tumor and non-tumor samples, followed by bioinformatics processing and quality control. Consensus clustering and regularized Cox regression analyses were performed on transcriptome data. Driver mutations and mutational signatures were assessed. These results were compared to those from 373 HCC patients of different races and ethnicities and diverse etiologies. Furthermore, molecular subclass gene signatures from multiple previous studies were assessed for validation.</p> <p><strong>Results and Conclusions:</strong> Using a transcriptomics-based unsupervised approach, we identified four molecular subclasses among Mongolian HCC cases, which were associated with different patient survival outcomes. These molecular subclasses were mapped to signatures reported in other HCC cohorts, showing significant associations consistent with survival outcomes. A supervised analysis determined risk scores strongly associated with survival, consistent with the four molecular subclasses. Mutational signature analysis using recently published COSMIC and Environmental Agents Compendia identified signatures with distinct prevalence among HDV+ and HVD- groups. Signatures differentially associated with HDV+ include mutational patterns linked to alkylating agents (such as temozolomide), tobacco chewing and exposures to 1,8-Dinitropyrene and furan, whereas HDV- appeared differentially associated with aristolochic acid II. In addition to common driver mutations (TP53, CTNNB1) frequently found in pan-cancer analysis, Mongolian HCC exhibits several unique drivers (most notably GTF2IRD2B, PNRC2, and SPTA1), the latter of which may be linked to HDV infection. These results suggest the existence of new molecular mechanisms at play in Mongolian hepatocarcinogenesis.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Background:</p> <p>Major problems with stem cell transplantation (SCT) for cancer treatment are a lack of suitable donors for patients without an HLA tissue-matched sibling and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), a serious side effects of immune-suppressing chemotherapy that is given to bring the cancer under control before SCT. In GVHD, the patient&#39;s immune system attacks the transplanted donor cells.</p> <p>This study will try to improve the results of SCT from unrelated HLA-matched donors using targeted immune-depleting chemotherapy to bring the cancer under control before transplantation and to lower the chance of graft rejection, followed by reduced-intensity transplant chemotherapy to make the procedure less toxic.</p> <p>Objectives:</p> <p>To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of targeted immune-depleting chemotherapy followed by reduced-intensity transplant chemotherapy in patients with advanced cancers of the blood and immune system.</p> <p>To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of two different drug combinations to prevent GVHD. Both regimens have been successful in preventing GVHD, but they work by different mechanisms and affect the rebuilding of the immune system after the transplant.</p> <p>Eligibility:</p> <p>People 18 to 74 years of age with advanced or high-risk cancers of the blood and immune system who do not have a suitable HLA-matched sibling.</p> <p>Design:</p> <p>All patients receive chemotherapy before transplant to treat the cancer and suppress immune function.</p> <p>All patients receive a conditioning regimen of cyclophosphamide for 4 days and fludarabine for 4 days before SCT to prepare for the transplant.</p> <p>Patients are randomly assigned to one of two combination drug treatments to prevent GHVD as follows: <ul> <li>Group 1: Tacrolimus starting 3 days before SCT and continuing for 6 months, plus methotrexate on days 1, 3, 6, and 11 post-SCT, plus sirolimus starting 3 days before the SCT and continuing through day 14 following SCT.</li> <li>Group 2: Alemtuzumab for 4 days starting 8 days before SCT, plus cyclosporine starting 1 day before SCT and continuing for 6 months.</li> </ul> </p> <p>Patients receive the donor&#39;s stem cells and immune cells 2 days after the conditioning regimen.</p> <p>Patients are followed at the clinic regularly for the first 6 months after SCT, and then less often for at least 5 years. Some visits may include bone marrow aspirates and biopsies, blood draws, and other tests to monitor disease status.</p> <p>A skin biopsy, oral mucosa biopsy, and saliva collection are done to study chronic GVHD.</p>",

The purpose of this project is to perform whole genome sequencing on serial samples from patients with osteosarcoma obtained before treatment, after treatment, and at relapse/metastasis in order to identify the mutations and pathways that are drivers of drug resistance. If successful, our results may help identify patients at high risk for treatment failure and may yield new treatments for children who cannot currently be cured.<br></p>",

    "description": "<p>Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the most lethal common malignancy, with little improvement in patient outcomes over the past few decades. Recently, subtypes of pancreatic cancer with different prognoses have been elaborated. However, the inability to model these subtypes has precluded mechanistic investigation of their origins. Here, we present an orthotopic xenotransplantation model of human patient-derived PDAC organoids in which organoids are grafted via direct injection into the pancreatic duct of immunocompromised (NSG) mice. Tumors that arise from these intraductally grafted organoids (IGOs) enable the distinction of the two main PDAC subtypes: intraepithelial neoplasms from this model progress in an indolent or invasive manner representing the classical or basal-like subtypes of PDAC, respectively, depending on which organoid they originate from. RNA-sequencing was used to characterize the tumors that resulted from IGO xenografts, and to compare the fast- and slow-progressing IGO tumors. Tumors generated using a traditional orthotopic xenograft model, in which organoids are injected into the parenchyma of the pancreas (i.e. orthotopically grafted organoids, or OGOs), were also sequenced for comparison with the IGO tumors. To further characterize the model, laser-capture microdissection followed by RNA-sequencing was used to compare intraductal to invasive lesions resulting from IGOs. To better understand the connection between KRAS signaling and the fast-progressing phenotype, RNA-sequencing was used to compare cultured organoids in which oncogenic KRAS (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3845\">GeneID: 3845</a>) was hyperactivated to control organoids, and to compare laser-capture microdissected lesions derived from IGOs of KRAS-hyperactivated organoids to lesions derived from control organoids. To ascertain copy number, low-coverage, whole genome DNA-sequencing was performed on organoids cultured in vitro, and on laser-capture microdissected lesions derived from IGO tumors.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Glioblastoma (GBM) is a lethal disease without effective treatments. To advance toward effective therapeutic approaches that are biomarker-driven, there is a need for new targeted agents and to develop accurate preclinical models that encompass its cellular and molecular diversity. Historical cell line models poorly represent molecular diversity of GBMs, so we developed a living tissue bank encompassing 103 patient-derived GBM cell lines (PDGCLs) as a platform for preclinical pharmacogenomic investigation at scale. Thirty-four PDGCLs were submitted to a comprehensive molecular characterization of copy number alterations and mutations using whole exome sequencing (WES) and gene expression (microarrays), and tested against a panel of 390 small molecules at sixteen different duplicated concentrations. After integrating and systematically correlating molecular alterations with drug sensitivities, we yielded 8,083,140 pharmacogenomic interactions, and discovered novel drug and biomarker combinations which help to prioritize highly effective novel candidate treatments in GBM. Our findings demonstrate the utility of deep characterization of large numbers of models from a single disease to detect complex predictors of compound sensitivity, and indicate novel therapeutic approaches for a large fraction of patients with GBM. </p>",

    "description": "<p>Breast cancer has a significant genetic component. The strongest epidemiologic risk factor is family history of the disease. Familial studies have identified a number of genes contributing to increased risk. Of these, the highly penetrant BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes account for the majority of families in whom disease-causal mutations have been identified. However, mutations in other genes have been associated with predisposition to breast or breast and ovarian cancer including (CHEK2, ATM, PALB2, RAD51C, RAD51D). Together these genes account for less than 20% of excess familial breast cancer risk and do not explain ~50% of high-risk families referred for genetic testing. This significant gap in our understanding of the genetic basis of breast cancer poses a significant barrier to our ability to identify women at increased risk, who would benefit greatly from appropriate clinical management. To identify additional breast cancer predisposition genes whole exome sequencing of familial high-risk breast cancer patients was undertaken. DNA samples from 50 pairs of breast cancer patients from high-risk breast cancer families with no pathogenic mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 breast cancer predisposition genes were subjected to whole exome sequencing. The goal was to select candidate predisposition genes for further validation studies based on sharing of putative protein inactivating mutations among both members of each family and/or the frequency of inactivating mutations among the 50 families.</p>",

We dissected multiple consecutive samples from the center of the tumor towards the tumor&#39;s periphery, a normal sample ~5 cm distant from the tumor, and, where feasible, metastatic regions in the adrenal gland. Specifically, we performed 60X multi-region whole-genome sequencing (mWGS), both genome-wide methylation and SNP array profiling, and deep targeted sequencing (average 500X coverage) of 254 cancer driver genes (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=24390350\">PMID:24390350</a>).

    "description": "<p>Colorectal cancer (CRC) patients with peritoneal metastases (CRPM) have limited treatment options and the lowest CRC survival rates. We trialed the possibility of organoid directed precision treatment for CRPM patients. CRPM organoids (peritonoids) isolated from patients underwent next-generation sequencing and medium-throughput drug panel testing ex vivo to identify specific drug sensitivities for each patient. We measured the utility of such a service including: success of peritonoid generation, time to cultivate peritonoids, reproducibility of the medium-throughput drug testing, and documented changes to clinical therapy as a result of the testing. Peritonoids were successfully generated and validated from 68% (19/28) of patients undergoing standard care. Genomic and drug profiling was completed within 8 weeks and a formal report ranking drug sensitivities was provided to the medical oncology team upon failure of standard care treatment. This resulted in a treatment change for 2 patients, one of whom had a partial response despite previously progressing on multiple rounds of standard care chemotherapy. The barrier to implementing this technology in Australia is the need for drug access and funding for off-label indications. In conclusion, our approach is feasible, reproducible and can guide novel therapeutic choices in this poor prognosis cohort, where new treatment options are urgently needed. This platform is relevant to many solid organ malignancies.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Purpose: The purpose of this study was to assess the somatic mutation landscape of breast tumors before and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The data includes whole exome sequencing of pre- and post- tissues that were collected in the context of an already published clinical trial SWOG S0800 (ZA Nahleh et al. <i>Breast Cancer Research and Treatment</i>. 158:485-495, 2016). The trial compared the efficacy of sequential nab-paclitaxel followed or preceded by doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide anthracycline chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab as preoperative therapy for stage II-III breast cancer.</p> <p><u>Experimental Design:</u> 29 pre-treatment biopsies and 9 matching post-treatment surgically resected cancer tissues were available for analysis and were subjected to whole exome sequencing to identify mutational patterns associated with response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The 9 paired samples with residual invasive cancer after therapy were also analyzed to assess changes in mutational patterns in response to therapy. No matching normal tissues were available for germline sequencing and therefore we used n&#61;7 post-treatment breast tissues without residual cancer (i.e. complete eradication of cancer by therapy) as a normal cohort to facilitate somatic variant calling.</p><p><u>Conclusion:</u> These results suggest that genomic disturbances in BRCA-related DNA repair mechanisms, reflected by a dominant mutational signature 3, confer increased chemotherapy sensitivity. Cancers that survive neoadjuvant chemotherapy, frequently have alterations in cell cycle regulating genes but different genes are affected in different patients.</p>",

Here, we developed solutions to overcome this obstacle in the context of normal human skin, thus offering the first glimpse into the genomic landscapes of melanocytes at single-cell resolution. We comprehensively genotyped 133 melanocytes from 19 sites across 6 donors. As expected, sun-shielded melanocytes had fewer mutations than sun-exposed melanocytes. However, within sun-exposed sites, melanocytes on chronically sun-exposed skin (e.g. the face) displayed a lower mutation burden than melanocytes on intermittently sun-exposed skin (e.g. the back). Melanocytes from donors with a history of skin cancer had higher mutation burdens than melanocytes from donors without skin cancer, implying that the mutation burden of normal skin can be harnessed to measure cumulative sun damage and skin cancer risk. Moreover, melanocytes from healthy skin commonly harbor pathogenic mutations, likely explaining the origins of the melanomas that arise in the absence of a pre-existing nevus. Phylogenetic analyses identified groups of related melanocytes, suggesting that melanocytes spread throughout skin as fields of clonally related cells, invisible to the naked eye. Overall, our study offers an unprecedented view into the genomic landscapes of individual melanocytes, revealing key insights into the causes and origins of melanoma.</p>",

RMS comprises two major subtypes: fusion-positive (FP, most commonly <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=5077\">PAX3</a>- <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=2308\">FOXO1</a> or <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=5081\">PAX7</a>-FOXO1) and fusion-negative (FN, frequently associated with mutations in RAS pathway). Our previous study demonstrated that FP and FN tumors exhibit distinct DNA methylation profiles. In this study, further investigation of genome-wide DNA methylation profiles in RMS tumors revealed DNA methylation differences between AX3-FOXO1 and PAX7-FOXO1 subsets in FP RMS, and between RAS mutation and RAS wild-type subsets in FN RMS. These data provide new insight into the relationship of DNA methylation with mutational changes and transcriptional organization in FP and FN RMS.</p>",

    "history": "<p>Orofacial clefts (OFC) represent the most common group of craniofacial birth defects, affecting up to 1/700 live births worldwide. OFC represent a major public health burden for patients, their families and the overall health care system. OFC can be surgically corrected early in life, but complete treatment requires a multidisciplinary team to restore aesthetics and full function. While it has become standard to have this type of multidisciplinary team in developed countries, most low-income and developing countries do not have adequate resources, and there is considerable health inequality for OFC patients across the world. There is substantial social stigmatization associated with OFC, and population based studies have reported individuals with OFC have higher mortality rates throughout life, even in developed countries. In addition, OFC patients are at a higher risk for cancers and certain mental illnesses. The high morbidity associated with OFC and its required treatment add up to a life-time cost estimated at around $200,000 per patient. Therefore, OFC are important birth defects where we still need a better understanding of genes controlling risk to identify those at highest risk and to design effective prevention strategies.</p> <p>The Gabriella Miller &#39;Kids First&#39; Pediatric Research Program has created a unique opportunity for comprehensive genomic studies of OFC. This current project will complement and extend the two Kids First X01 studies of OFC case-parent trios by conducting WGS in about 300 case-parent trios from two separate racial groups in Africa and Asia collected by independent genetic epidemiologic studies directed by Dr. Butali and by Dr. Beaty, respectively.</p>",

To provide an insight into the molecular phenotype of this demographically distinct disease, we have performed a proteogenomics study on a prospectively collected cohort representing early stage lung adenocarcinomas in Taiwan. The distinct mutational profile revealed high prevalence of the APOBEC mutational signature in early-onset females implicating differential regulation of APOBEC enzymes and DNA damage pathways, as well as enrichment of mutational signatures congruent with environmental carcinogens over-represented in the genomic location of EGFR. We delineate the proteogenomic hallmarks of tumor progression and propose a proteomics-informed classification that resolves the EGFR mutation heterogeneity associated with survival within the early stages. Functional annotation of the molecular subtypes by protein network analysis highlights candidate biomarkers for patient stratification. Our integrative analysis reveals the molecular architecture of lung cancer in East Asia and enables the path for precision medicine.</p>",

Specifically, using OpenCAP, 111 variants were identified as relevant for the capture panel and 2,027 smMIPs were designed to target these variants. The smMIPs panel design was employed on all samples to validate the capture panel design. When compared to original sequencing, the CIViC smMIPs capture panel demonstrated a 95% sensitivity for variant detection (n = 61 variants). Additionally, the CIViC smMIPs capture panel identified 182 additional clinically relevant variants that had been missed on original sequencing.</p>",

Tumors were evaluated by histology and whole transcriptome sequencing.</p> <p>Results: We report here that tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) levels directly associate with relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) in resected tumors from Group A, where early responses to the immunotherapy agent could be assessed. TIL levels directly associated with a previously reported immune signature which associated with RFS and OS, particularly in Group A tumors. In Group A tumors there were decreased cell cycling gene RNA transcripts, but increased RNA transcripts for repair and growth genes. We found that outcome (RFS and OS) was directly associated with several immune signatures and immune-related RNA transcripts and inversely associated with several tumor growth-associated transcripts, particularly in Group A tumors. Most of these associations were not seen in Group B tumors.</p> <p>Conclusion: We interpret these data to signify that both immunologic and tumoral cell processes, as measured by RNAseq analyses detected shortly after initiation of hu14.18-IL2 therapy are associated with long term survival and could potentially be used as prognostic biomarkers in tumor resection specimens obtained after initiating neoadjuvant immunotherapy.</p> <p>Note: RNA sequences and expression data can be found at NCBI GEO GSE133713</p>",

The sub-studies that contributed include Harvard, Liverpool, Toronto, and IARC. The IARC and Toronto studies are described above. A description of the Harvard and Liverpool studies is provided below. </p> <p><i><b>Liverpool Lung Project:</b></i> The Liverpool Lung Project (LLP)1 is a case control and cohort study, which has over 11,500 individuals, with detailed epidemiological, clinical and outcome data with associated specimens (i.e. tumour tissue, blood, plasma, sputum, bronchial lavage, EBUS and oral brushings). The participants have completed a detailed lifestyle questionnaire and updated data on clinical outcome and hospital events are collected through the Office of National Statistics, Cancer Registry and from Health Episode Statistics. The project is registered on the UK National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) lung cancer portfolio and has all the required ethical approvals and sponsorship arrangements in place. The LLP has detailed standard operating procedures (SOP) for all aspects of the recruitment, data, specimen collection as well as the data storage. The LLP Cohort study has 8,224 participants with blood and 7,761 with plasma samples. The LLP case-control samples have been incorporated into in a large number of international GWAS and molecular studies <sup>2,3</sup>, methylation <sup>4-7</sup>, microRNA <sup>8</sup>and next generation studies <sup>9-11</sup>, resulting in high ranking publications, as well as forming the basis for the LLP risk prediction model <sup>12-14</sup> which has been utilised in the UK lung cancer screening trial (UKLS) <sup>15-17</sup></p> <p>Patient and control DNAs were derived from EDTA-venous blood samples.</p> <p><b>Harvard Samples.</b> David Christiani at the Harvard University School of Public Health has been directing research studies to investigate etiological factors influencing lung cancer development since 1983 and has amassed a collection of 2000 controls and 5055 lung cancer cases. He has been actively collecting and storing snap frozen tumor samples since 1992. Around 1500 tumor samples have been collected and the average wet tumor yield is about 30 grams of tumor, of which 631 cases have completely annotated clinical and survival information. Pathology confirmation is provided by two pathologists. At the time of surgery, a minimum of 30 grams of wet lung tumor tissue and 30 grams of non-involved tissue from the same lobe is sectioned, flash frozen and sent to Dr. Christiani&#39;s lab for logging and storage. A blood sample for DNA and serum is collected. A structured interview by trained research staff is conducted on each case, and clinical outcomes and treatments is extracted and entered into the molecular epidemiology data base at Harvard. Fresh frozen samples have been collected from 1451 lung cancer and are available for study. Samples from this collaborative study have played key roles in major studies, including the initial finding describing EGFR mutations in lung cancer <sub>22</sub>. Participants in this study are patients, &#62; 18 years of age, with newly diagnosed histologically confirmed lung cancer. Samples that are included in the analysis have the following histologies: Adenocarcinoma: 8140/3, 8250/3, 8260/3, 8310/3, 8480/3 8560/3; LCC: 8012/3, 8031/3; squamous carcinoma: 8070/3, 8071/3, 8072/3, 8074/3; and other NSCLC: 8010/3, 8020/3, 8021/3, 8032/3, 8230/3.</p> <p><b>The Toronto Study:</b> The Toronto study was conducted in the Great Toronto Area between 1997 and 2014. Cases were recruited at the hospitals in the network of University of Toronto and Lunenfeld- Tanenbaum Research Institute. At the time of recruitment in the clinical setting, provisional diagnoses of lung carcinoma were first assigned based on clinical criteria. Diagnoses for all cases included were histologically confirmed by the reference pathologist who is a specialist in pulmonary pathology, based on review of pathology reports from surgery, biopsy or cytology samples in 100% of cases. Diagnostic classification was done initially according to ICD-9, ICD-10, and ICD for oncology-2, and subsequently converted to ICD-O-3. Tumors were grouped into the major categories included in this analysis according to primary cancer type based on the ICD-3 definitions. Controls were randomly selected from individual visiting family medicine clinics and Ministry of Finance Municipal Tax Tapes. All subjects were interviewed using a standard questionnaire and information on lifestyle risk factors, occupational history, medical and family history was collected. Blood samples were collected from more than 85% of the subjects.</p> <p><b>IARC:</b> The IARC data are derived from case-control studies conducted in Russia and include samples that have available tissue samples. Patient and control DNAs were derived from EDTA-venous blood samples. The lung cancer patients were classified according to ICD-O-3; SQ: 8070/3, 8071/3, 8072/3, 8074/3; AD: 8140/3, 8250/3, 8260/3, 8310/3, 8480/3, 8560/3, 8251/3, 8490/3, 8570/3, 8574/3; with tumous with overlapping histologies classified as mixed.</p> <p><b>The Lung Cancer Transdisciplinary Research Cohort is utilized in the following dbGaP sub-studies.</b> To view genotypes, other molecular data, and derived variables collected in these sub-studies, please click on the following sub-studies below or in the \"Sub-studies\" section of this top-level study page <a href=\"study.cgi?study_id=phs000876\">phs000876</a> Lung Cancer Transdisciplinary Research Cohort. <ul> <li><a href=\"study.cgi?study_id=phs000877\">phs000877</a> Meta Analysis</li> <li><a href=\"study.cgi?study_id=phs000878\">phs000878</a> CIDR Lung Cancer</li> <li><a href=\"study.cgi?study_id=phs001681\">phs001681</a> Affy Axiom Array</li> </ul> </p>",

All studies were reviewed and approved by institutional ethics review committees at the involved institutions. </p> <p><b>CARET.</b> The Carotene and Retinol Efficacy Trial (CARET) was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of the cancer prevention efficacy and safety of a daily combination of 30 mg of beta-carotene and 25,000 IU of retinyl palmitate in 18,314 persons at high risk for lung cancer. CARET began in 1985, and the intervention was halted in January 1996, 21 months ahead of schedule, with the twin conclusions for definitive evidence of no benefit and substantial evidence of a harmful effect of the intervention on both lung cancer incidence and total mortality. CARET continued to follow and collect endpoints on their participants through 2005. Pathology reports and medical records were reviewed to confirm cancer endpoints, and death certificates obtained to capture cause of death. During the active intervention phase of CARET, serum, plasma, whole blood, and lung tissue specimens were collected on participants. These biospecimens make up the CARET Biorepository. For the OncoArray Project, CARET provided DNA extracted from whole blood of lung cancer cases and controls matched on age at baseline (&#43;/- 4 years), sex, race, baseline smoking status, history of occupational asbestos exposure (asbestos vs heavy smoker), and year of enrollment (2-year intervals). </p> <p><b>EPIC. </b>The European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study. The European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study is a multi-center cohort study involving 521,000 study participants from 10 European countries.ref The current study involved EPIC participants from 7 countries (Greece, Netherlands, UK, France, Germany, Spain, and Italy), including 1010 incident lung cancer cases and 1025 smoking matched controls. </p> <p><b>Nurses Health Study</b></p> <p>The NHS was initiated in 1976, when 121,700 United States registered nurses between the ages of 30 and 55 returned an initial questionnaire reporting medical histories and baseline health-related exposures. Every two years, follow-up questionnaires are mailed to the participants (questionnaire response rate &#62;90% for all follow-up cycles). Diet was assessed in 1986, 1990, 1994, and 1996 with a semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire. Between 1989 and 1990, blood samples and relevant sample collection information (blood draw features such as fasting status at blood collection) were collected from 32,826 women.</p> <p><b>National Physician Health Study</b></p> <p>The National Physicians Health Study The remaining 22,071 physicians were then randomly assigned to receive active aspirin and active beta-carotene (n&#61;5,517), active aspirin and beta-carotene placebo (n&#61;5,520), aspirin placebo and active beta-carotene (n&#61;5,519), or aspirin placebo and beta-carotene placebo (n&#61;5,515). A total of 11,037 physicians were randomized to aspirin and 11,034 to aspirin placebo; a total of 11,034 physicians were randomized to beta-carotene and 11,037 to beta-carotene placebo. </p> <p><b>The Multiethnic Cohort (MEC).</b> The MEC Study includes 215,251 men and women aged 45-74 years at recruitment, primarily from five ethnic/racial groups - African Americans and Latinos mostly recruited from CA (mainly from Los Angeles County) and Japanese Americans, Native Hawaiians and whites (mostly recruited from HI). The cohort was assembled in 1993-1996 by mailing a self-administered questionnaire to persons identified primarily through driver&#39;s license files. The baseline questionnaire obtained information on demographics, anthropometry, smoking history, medical and reproductive histories, family history of cancer, diet and physical activity. Incident cancer cases are identified by regular linkage with the State of California Cancer Registry and the Hawaii Tumor Registry, both members of the SEER Program of the NCI. In 2001-2006, a prospective biorepository was assembled by collecting a pre-diagnostic blood specimen from 67,594 surviving MEC members. At the time of blood collection a short questionnaire was administered that included information on smoking during the previous 15 days. For this study, cases were all lung cancer cases incident to blood draw and diagnosed before December 2012. For each case, a control was selected among unaffected MEC participants who were alive at time of the case&#39;s diagnosis and matched on study site, sex, race/ethnicity, age (age at diagnosis for cases; age at blood collection for controls), and date of blood collection.</p> <p><b>The Mount-Sinai Hospital-Princess Margaret Study (MSH-PMH). MSH-PMH</b> was conducted in the greater Toronto area from 2008 to 2013. Lung cancer cases were recruited at the hospitals in the network of the University of Toronto. Controls were selected randomly from individuals registered in the family medicine clinics databases and were frequency matched with cases on age and sex. All subjects were interviewed, and information on lifestyle risk factors, occupational history and medical and family history was collected using a standard questionnaire. Tumors were centrally reviewed by the reference pathologist (a member of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) committee) and a second pathologist in the University Health Network. If the reviews conflicted, a consensus was arrived at after discussion. Coding of histology was based on 2001 WHO/IASLC. Genomic DNA was extracted based on standard protocol.</p> <p><b>PLCO. </b>The PLCO study, a randomized trial aimed at evaluating the efficacy of screening in reducing cancer mortality, recruited approximately 155,000 men and women age 55 to 74 years from 1992 to 20014. Screening for lung cancer among participants in the intervention arm included a chest x-ray at baseline followed by either three annual x-rays (for current or former smokers at enrollment) or two annual x-rays (for never smokers); participants in the control arm received routine health care. Screening-arm participants provided data on sociodemographic factors, smoking behavior, anthropometric characteristics, medical history, and family history of cancer, as well as blood samples annually for the first 6 years of the study (baseline [T0] and T1 through T5). Lung cancers were ascertained through annual questionnaires mailed to the participants, and positive reports were followed up by abstracting medical records or death certificates. Follow-up in the trial as of July 2009 was 96.7%. Patients were excluded because of missing baseline questionnaire, previous history of any cancer, diagnosis of multiple cancers during follow-up, missing smoking information at baseline, missing consent for utilization of biologic specimens for etiologic studies, or unavailability/insufficient quantity of serum or DNA specimens.</p> <p><b>The Harvard Lung Cancer Study (HLCS). </b>HLCS is a case-control study based at Mass General Hospital (MGH) in Boston, Massachusetts from 1992 to 2004. Eligible cases included any person over the age of 18 years with a diagnosis of primary lung cancer that was further confirmed by an MGH lung pathologist. Controls were recruited from the friends or spouses of cancer patients or the friends or spouses of other surgery patients in the same hospital. Potential controls were excluded from participation if they had a diagnosis of any cancer (other than non-melanoma skin cancer). Interviewer-administered questionnaires, a modified version of the standardized American Thoracic Society respiratory questionnaire, collected information on demographics, medical history, family history of cancer, smoking history, and a detailed work history, including job titles and tasks. The Institutional Review Board of MGH and the Human Subjects Committee of the Harvard School of Public Health approved the study.</p> <p><b>Liverpool Lung Project. </b>The Roy Castle Lung Study of Liverpool Lung Project (LLP) is a case-control and cohort study which has recruited over 11,500 individuals since 1996 from the Liverpool region in the UK. Detailed epidemiological and clinical data is collected with associated specimens (i.e. tumour tissue, blood, plasma, sputum, bronchial lavage and oral brushings). The participants have completed a detailed lifestyle questionnaire at recruitment, with repeat questionnaires at intervals; updated data on clinical outcome and hospital events are collected through the Health and Social Care Information Centre (including Office of National Statistics mortality data, Cancer Registry and Health Episode Statistics). The project is registered on the UK National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) lung cancer portfolio and has all the required ethical approvals and sponsorship arrangements in place. The lung tumours were reviewed by the reference pathologist.</p> <p><b>The IARC Russian Cancer study. </b>Lung cancer cases and controls were recruited through a multicentric case-control study coordinated by the International Agency for Research on Cancer in Russia, from 2005 to 2013. Cases were incident cancer patients collected from general hospitals. Controls were recruited from individuals visiting general hospitals and out-patient clinics for disorders unrelated to lung cancer and/or its associated risk factors, or from the general population. Information on lifestyle risk factors, medical and family history was collected from subjects by interview using a standard questionnaire. All study participants provided written informed consent. The current study included 4882 lung cancer cases and 5313 controls genotyped on the Affymetrix Axiome Array.</p> <p>Summary: After quality control, the following samples are available for analysis.</p> <p> <style> table, th, td { border: 1px solid black; border-collapse: collapse; } th, td { padding: 5px; text-align: left; } </style> <table style=\"width:100%\"> <tr> <th rowspan=\"9\">Study</th> <td>CARET (CART22)</td> <td>CARET Nested case-control</td> <td>USA</td> <td>524</td> <td>(34.8)</td> <td>978</td> <td>(65.2)</td> <td>1502</td> </tr> <tr> <td>EPIC-Lung (EPIC45)</td> <td>CARET Nested case-control</td> <td>Europe (Multi-site)</td> <td>481</td> <td>(51.3)</td> <td>456</td> <td>(48.7)</td> <td>937</td> </tr> <tr> <td>NHS/NPHS (HARV50)</td> <td>CARET Nested case-control</td> <td>USA</td> <td>475</td> <td>(50.7)</td> <td>462</td> <td>(49.3)</td> <td>937</td> </tr> <tr> <td>LCS (HSPH01)</td> <td>Hospital-based</td> <td>USA</td> <td>656</td> <td>(47.5)</td> <td>726</td> <td>(52.5)</td> <td>1382</td> </tr> <tr> <td>LLP (LLPC52)</td> <td>Hospital-based</td> <td>UK</td> <td>393</td> <td>(50.8)</td> <td>381</td> <td>(49.2)</td> <td>774</td> </tr> <tr> <td>MEC (MECO46)</td> <td>Nested case-control</td> <td>USA</td> <td>651</td> <td>(48.9)</td> <td>680</td> <td>(51.1)</td> <td>1331</td> </tr> <tr> <td>MSH-PMH (MCCT48)</td> <td>Clinic-based</td> <td>Canada</td> <td>1049</td> <td>(55.5)</td> <td>842</td> <td>(44.5)</td> <td>1891</td> </tr> <tr> <td>PLCO (PLCO53)</td> <td>Nested case-control</td> <td>USA</td> <td>175</td> <td>(33.3)</td> <td>351</td> <td>(66.7)</td> <td>526</td> </tr> <tr> <td>RUSS (RUSS54)</td> <td>Hospital-based</td> <td>Russia</td> <td>478</td> <td>(52.2)</td> <td>437</td> <td>(47.8)</td> <td>915</td> </tr> </table> </p> <p>Quality Control for Markers:<br/> <ul style=\"list-style-type:circle\"> <li>1) 414504 markers from TRICL CHIP (414603, excluding 99 markers with missing chromosome)</li> <li>2) 392574 markers excluding MNP, INDEL</li> <li>3) 382020 markers excluding duplicated SNPs (based on Affy&#39;s SNPs, one to one matched to dbSNPs, but some dbSNPs are missing)</li> <li>Call rate for 382020 SNP markers, 376571 among 382020 markers (0.9857363) have &#62;&#61; 95% call rate</li> <li>Median Concordance rate among 1801 duplicated markers is 0.998</li> </ul> Despite excellent concordance rate there were a large number of signals for association among markers with low allele frequency.

All studies were reviewed and approved by institutional ethics review committees at the involved institutions.</p> <p><b>Sequencing data</b> are derived from four substudies. The substudies that contributed include Harvard, Liverpool, Toronto, and IARC. The IARC and Toronto studies are described above. A description of the Harvard and Liverpool studies is provided below.</p> <p><i><b>Liverpool Lung Project:</b></i> The Liverpool Lung Project (LLP)1 is a case control and cohort study, which has over 11,500 individuals, with detailed epidemiological, clinical and outcome data with associated specimens (i.e. tumour tissue, blood, plasma, sputum, bronchial lavage, EBUS and oral brushings). The participants have completed a detailed lifestyle questionnaire and updated data on clinical outcome and hospital events are collected through the Office of National Statistics, Cancer Registry and from Health Episode Statistics. The project is registered on the UK National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) lung cancer portfolio and has all the required ethical approvals and sponsorship arrangements in place. The LLP has detailed standard operating procedures (SOP) for all aspects of the recruitment, data, specimen collection as well as the data storage. The LLP Cohort study has 8,224 participants with blood and 7,761 with plasma samples. The LLP case-control samples have been incorporated into in a large number of international GWAS and molecular studies <sup>2,3</sup>, methylation <sup>4-7</sup>, microRNA 8and next generation studies <sup>9-11</sup>, resulting in high ranking publications, as well as forming the basis for the LLP risk prediction model <sup>12-14</sup> which has been utilised in the UK lung cancer screening trial (UKLS) <sup>15-17</sup>.<br/> Patient and control DNAs were derived from EDTA-venous blood samples.</p> <p>Harvard Samples. David Christiani at the Harvard University School of Public Health has been directing research studies to investigate etiological factors influencing lung cancer development since 1983 and has amassed a collection of 2000 controls and 5055 lung cancer cases. He has been actively collecting and storing snap frozen tumor samples since 1992. Around 1500 tumor samples have been collected and the average wet tumor yield is about 30 grams of tumor, of which 631 cases have completely annotated clinical and survival information. Pathology confirmation is provided by two pathologists. At the time of surgery, a minimum of 30 grams of wet lung tumor tissue and 30 grams of non-involved tissue from the same lobe is sectioned, flash frozen and sent to Dr. Christiani&#39;s lab for logging and storage. A blood sample for DNA and serum is collected. A structured interview by trained research staff is conducted on each case, and clinical outcomes and treatments is extracted and entered into the molecular epidemiology data base at Harvard. Fresh frozen samples have been collected from 1451 lung cancer and are available for study. Samples from this collaborative study have played key roles in major studies, including the initial finding describing EGFR mutations in lung cancer<sup>22</sup>. Participants in this study are patients, &#62; 18 years of age, with newly diagnosed histologically confirmed lung cancer. Samples that are included in the analysis have the following histologies: Adenocarcinoma: 8140/3, 8250/3, 8260/3, 8310/3, 8480/3 8560/3; LCC: 8012/3, 8031/3; squamous carcinoma: 8070/3, 8071/3, 8072/3, 8074/3; and other NSCLC: 8010/3, 8020/3, 8021/3, 8032/3, 8230/3.</p> <p><b>The Toronto Study:</b> The Toronto study was conducted in the Great Toronto Area between 1997 and 2014. Cases were recruited at the hospitals in the network of University of Toronto and Lunenfeld - Tanenbaum Research Institute. At the time of recruitment in the clinical setting, provisional diagnoses of lung carcinoma were first assigned based on clinical criteria. Diagnoses for all cases included were histologically confirmed by the reference pathologist who is a specialist in pulmonary pathology, based on review of pathology reports from surgery, biopsy or cytology samples in 100% of cases. Diagnostic classification was done initially according to ICD-9, ICD-10, and ICD for oncology-2, and subsequently converted to ICD-O-3. Tumors were grouped into the major categories included in this analysis according to primary cancer type based on the ICD-3 definitions. Controls were randomly selected from individual visiting family medicine clinics and Ministry of Finance Municipal Tax Tapes. All subjects were interviewed using a standard questionnaire and information on lifestyle risk factors, occupational history, medical and family history was collected. Blood samples were collected from more than 85% of the subjects.</p> <p><b>IARC:</b> The IARC data are derived from case-control studies conducted in Russia and include samples that have available tissue samples. Patient and control DNAs were derived from EDTA-venous blood samples. The lung cancer patients were classified according to ICD-O-3; SQ: 8070/3, 8071/3, 8072/3, 8074/3; AD: 8140/3, 8250/3, 8260/3, 8310/3, 8480/3, 8560/3, 8251/3, 8490/3, 8570/3, 8574/3; with tumous with overlapping histologies classified as mixed.</p>",

All studies were reviewed and approved by institutional ethics review committees at the involved institutions. </p> <p><b>Genome-wide association studies</b><br/> The meta-analysis was based on data from six previously reported lung cancer GWAS of European populations: the MD Anderson Cancer Center lung cancer study (MDACC-GWAS)<sup>1</sup>; the UK lung cancer GWAS from the Institute for Cancer Research (ICR-GWAS)<sup>2</sup>; the NCI lung cancer GWAS (NCI-GWAS)<sup>3</sup>, the IARC lung cancer GWAS (IARC-GWAS)<sup>4</sup>, the LUCY and Kora Studies from Germany and a hospital based case-control study from the Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute of Mount Sinai Hospital and University of Toronto. In each of the studies, SNP genotyping had been performed using Illumina HumanHap 317, 317+240S, 370, 550, 610 or 1M arrays. </p> <p><b>IARC-GWAS:</b><br/> The IARC-GWAS4 comprised 3,062 lung cancer cases and 4,455 controls derived from five case-control studies: (i) Carotene and Retinol Efficacy Trial (CARET) cohort<sup>5</sup>; (ii) The Central Europe multicenter hospital-based case-control<sup>6,7</sup>; (iii) The hospital-based case-control study from France<sup>7</sup>; (iv) The hospital based case-control lung cancer study from Estonia<sup>8,9</sup>; and (v) The population-based HUNT2/Troms IV lung cancer studies<sup>10</sup>. Patient and control DNAs were derived from EDTA-venous blood samples. The lung cancer patients were classified according to ICD-O-3; SQ: 8070/3, 8071/3, 8072/3, 8074/3; AD: 8140/3, 8250/3, 8260/3, 8310/3, 8480/3, 8560/3, 8251/3, 8490/3, 8570/3, 8574/3; with tumours with overlapping histologies classified as mixed. After applying standardized quality control procedures 2,533 cases and 3,791 controls were included in the current analysis (Table 1).</p> <p><b>NCI-GWAS:</b> Details of the NCI-GWAS have been previously reported. Briefly, the study comprised samples from four series: (i) The Environment and Genetics in Lung cancer Etiology (EAGLE), a population-based case-control study of 2,100 lung cancer cases and 2,120 healthy controls enrolled in Italy between 2002 and 200511; cancers were classified according to ICD-O. Histology of ~10% of tumours were confirmed. (ii) The Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention Study (ATBC), a randomized primary prevention trial of 29,133 male smokers enrolled in Finland between 1985 and 199312; ICD-O-2 and ICD-O-3 was used to classify tumours. Cases diagnosed between 1985 and 1999 had histology reviewed by at least one pathologist. After 1999, histological coding (ICD-O-2 and ICD-O-3) was derived from the Finnish Cancer Registry. (iii) The Prostate, Lung, Colon, Ovary Screening Trial (PLCO), a randomized trial of 150,000 individuals enrolled in ten U.S. study centers between 1992 and 2001<sup>13</sup>; ICD-O-2 was used to classify tumors and quality assurance measures included reabstraction of 50 lung cancer diagnoses per year; (iv) The Cancer Prevention Study II Nutrition Cohort (CPS-II), a cohort study of approximately 184,000 individuals enrolled by the American Cancer Society between 1992 and 1993 in 21 U.S. states of which 109,379 provided a blood (36%) or buccal (64%) sample between 1998 and 2003<sup>14,15</sup>. Tumour histology was abstracted from Certified Tumor Registrars and coded using WHO ICD-O-2 and ICD-O-3. Quality assurance was done by re-abstracting 10% of all cancer diagnoses per year. After initial data control, the NCI-GWAS included 5,739 cases and 5,848 controls; however, an additional 26 cases and 112 controls were excluded due to changes in case status and further quality control filtering. The current meta-analysis included 5,713 lung cancer cases and 5,736 controls from the NCI-GWAS (Table 1).</p> <p><b>ICR-GWAS :</b> This comprised 1,952 cases (1,166 male; mean age at diagnosis 57 years, SD 6) with pathologically confirmed lung cancer ascertained through the Genetic Lung Cancer Predisposition Study (GELCAPS) conducted between March 1999 and July 2004<sup>16</sup>. All cases were British residents and self-reported to be of European Ancestry. To ensure that data and samples were collected from bona fide lung cancer cases and avoid issues of bias from survivorship only incident cases with histologically or cytologically (only if not AD) confirmed primary disease were ascertained. Tumours from patients were classified according to ICD-O-3; Specifically, SQ: 8070/3, 8071/3, 8072/3, 8074/3; AD: 8140/3, 8250/3, 8260/3, 8310/3, 8480/3, 8560/3, 8251/3, 8490/3, 8570/3, 8574/3; with tumours with overlapping histologies classified as mixed. Patient DNA was derived from EDTA-venous blood samples using conventional methodologies. Genotype frequencies were compared with publicly accessible data generated by the UK Wellcome Trust Case-Control Consortium 2 (WTCCC2) study<sup>17</sup> of individuals from the 1958 British Birth Cohort (58BC) and blood service typed using Illumina Human1.2M-Duo Custom_v1 Array BeadChips.</p> <p><b>MDACC-GWAS:</b> Cases and controls were ascertained from a case-control study at the U.T. M.D. Anderson Cancer Center conducted between 1997 and 2007<sup>1</sup>. Cases were newly diagnosed, patients with histologically-confirmed lung cancer presenting at M.D. Anderson Cancer and who had not previously received treatment other than surgery. Clinical and pathological data were abstracted from patient medical records and lung cancer histology was coded according to major histologocial groups. As per ICD-O-2 these groups were, SQ: 8070/3, AD: 8140/3, 8250/3, 8260/3, 8310/3, 8480/3, 8251/3 and 8490/3. Only patients with predominantly or wholly AD or SQ cancers were included; those with mixed histology or unspecified lung cancers, were excluded from the study. Controls were healthy individuals seen for routine care at Kelsey-Seybold Clinics, in the Houston Metropolitan area. Controls were frequency matched to cases according to smoking behaviour, age in 5-year categories, ethnicity, and sex. Former smoking controls were further frequency matched to former smoking cases according to the number of years since smoking cessation (in 5-year categories). After applying quality control data were available on 1,150 cases and 1,134 controls.</p> <p><b>HGF Germany:</b> The HGF GWA study was made up of three independent German studies as detailed below: In total 506 incident lung cancer cases (LUCY-study: n=305, Heidelberg lung cancer case-control study: n=201) were compared to 480 population controls (KORA surveys KORA). After excluding individuals with missing values and potentially related individuals 487 cases and 480 controls entered the data analysis for the TRICL meta-analysis project.</p> <p>LUCY (LUng Cancer in the Young) is a multicenter study with 31 recruiting hospitals in Germany <sup>18,19</sup>. The study is conducted by the Institute of Epidemiology, Helmholtz Zentrum Muenchen, and the Department of Genetic Epidemiology, Medical School, University of Gottingen). The LUCY-study provides access to a nationwide, population based family and a case-control sample (control population KORA, described below) of lung cancer patients aged 50 years or younger at diagnosis. Detailed epidemiologic data have been collected including data on medical history, education, family history of cancer and smoking exposure by phase assessment. Blood samples are taken and DNA and lymphoblastoid cell lines are prepared of all cases and controls and of parts of the relatives. Phenotype data of 847 young patients with primary lung cancer and 5524 relatives have been collected.</p> <p>Heidelberg lung cancer case-control study is an ongoing hospital based case-control study <sup>19,20</sup>. The German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) has recruited over 2000 lung cancer cases at and in collaboration with the Thoraxklinik Heidelberg, including 300 LC cases with onset of disease at the age of &#8804; 50. Approximately 750 hospital-based controls have also been recruited. Data on occupational exposure, tobacco smoking, educational status, and for a subgroup also on family history of lung cancer, assessed by a self-administered questionnaire is available. Blood samples have been taken, and DNA has been extracted.</p> <p>KORA (Cooperative health research in the Region of Augsburg) survey is a population-based KORA platform established by the Helmholtz Center Munich<sup>21</sup>. In total, four population based health surveys have been conducted during 1984/85-1999/2001. Overall 18000 participants in the age range between of 25 and 74 years at first interview were recruited. Detailed information on demographic characteristics, medical history, history of tobacco consumption and lifetime occupation together with biological materials were collected for more then 16000 probands.</p> <p><b>The Toronto Study:</b> The Toronto study was conducted in the Great Toronto Area between 1997 and 2002. Cases were recruited at the hospitals in the network of University of Toronto and Lunenfeld- Tanenbaum Research Institute. At the time of recruitment in the clinical setting, provisional diagnoses of lung carcinoma were first assigned based on clinical criteria. Diagnoses for all cases included were histologically confirmed by the reference pathologist who is a specialist in pulmonary pathology, based on review of pathology reports from surgery, biopsy or cytology samples in 100% of cases. Diagnostic classification was done initially according to ICD-9, ICD-10, and ICD for oncology-2, and subsequently converted to ICD-O-3. Tumors were grouped into the major categories included in this analysis according to primary cancer type based on the ICD-3 definitions. Controls were randomly selected from individual visiting family medicine clinics and Ministry of Finance Municipal Tax Tapes. All subjects were interviewed using a standard questionnaire and information on lifestyle risk factors, occupational history, medical and family history was collected. Blood samples were collected from more than 85% of the subjects. After applying the standardized quality control procedures and restricting to the study participants with European ancestry, 331 cases and 499 controls were included in the TRICL meta-analysis (7).</p> <p><b>Quality control of GWAS datasets:</b> Standard quality control was performed on all scans excluding individuals with low call rate (&#60;90%) and extremely high or low heterozygosity (i.e. P&#60;1.0 x 10<sup>-4</sup>), as well as all individuals evaluated to be of non-European ancestry (using the HapMap version 2 CEU, JPT/CHB and YRI populations as a reference; Supplementary Table 1). For apparent first-degree relative pairs, we removed the control from a case-control pair; otherwise, we excluded the individual with the lower call rate.</p>",
    "history": "<p>This study brings together 6 previously completed studies. The results for 6 of these studies were previously published with imputation to the HapMap 2, March 2012 release 22 while data from four of the studies (ICR-UK, IARC, NCI, and MD Anderson Cancer Center) were published with imputation to 1000 genomes.

When the trial ended as planned, women who were willing to participate continued in an observational follow-up study.</p> <p><u>Participants in Accelerometer Study</u><br/> From 2011-2015, an ancillary study collected data on physical activity and sedentary behavior using accelerometers. Women were mailed a triaxial accelerometer (ActiGraph GT3X+, ActiGraph Corp) with a wear log, and asked to wear this on their hip for seven consecutive days, removing it only during sleep and water-based activities. Further details have previously been published (PMID: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30666321\" target=\"_blank\">30666321</a>).</p> <p>A total of 17,708 women wore and returned their devices, and data were downloaded from the devices of 17,466 women; no data were available from the other 242 (device failure). By convention, a \"valid day\" of wear has data on at least 10 hours (PMID: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22698174\" target=\"_blank\">22698174</a>). Among these 17,466 women, 17,062 had at least one valid day of wear. The data are provided for all 17,062 women.</p> <p>Additionally, \"compliant wear\" is conventionally defined for participants wearing the device for at least 10 hours, on at least 4 days (PMID: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22698174\" target=\"_blank\">22698174</a>). Of the 17,062 women, 16,741 had compliant wear (PMID: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29109088\" target=\"_blank\">29109088</a>).</p> <p><u>Self-reported Physical Activity and Sedentary Behavior</u><br/> After we received the accelerometer from a WHS participant, she was sent a questionnaire asking her to report the time she spent in different physical activities during the week that the accelerometer was worn (see questionnaire below). A total of 15,514 women (91% of participants in the Accelerometer Study) returned their physical activity questionnaires.</p> <p>In addition, beginning in October 2012, we included questions on sedentary behavior; a total of 9,430 women returned questionnaires that included questions on both physical activity and sedentary behavior.</p>",

    "description": "<p><u>Introduction with rationale and aims for study</u></p> <p>Immune checkpoint blockade therapies have significantly altered the current landscape of cancer treatment. However, this immunotherapy still fails more often than it succeeds. There are now evidences that the lack of tumour infiltration by immune cells is the main mechanism of primary resistance to PD&#8208;1 blockade therapies for cancer. It has been postulated that cancer cell&#8208;intrinsic mechanisms may actively exclude T cells from tumours, suggesting that the finding of actionable molecules that could be inhibited to increase T cell infiltration may synergize with checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy.</p> <p>With the idea of finding potential drivers of immune exclusion, we performed RNA sequencing analysis of biopsies from melanoma patients and compared the transcriptomic differences of samples that where infiltrated with those that did not have immune infiltration.</p> <p><u>Methods</u></p> <p>RNAseq analysis of gene expressions on biopsies from melanoma patients treated with checkpoint blockade were analysed. We focused on the variable of \"infiltration: yes or no,\", e.g. tumors that were well infiltrated by immune cells with those that kept immune cells out. Sequencing revealed a list of genes whose expression differed between the infiltrated and noninfiltrated tumors. The kinase PAK4 stood out as a good candidate for inhibition treatment in the future as it was consistently enriched in the samples without immune infiltration. To test whether immunotherapy would work better if we deleted PAK4, we first knocked out PAK4, using CRISPR&#8208;Cas9, in the &#8208;resistant melanoma cell line, B16. Then they injected the melanoma cells into mice and observed that PAK4 KO tumours now responded to PD&#8208;1 blockade. In order to elucidate whether pharmacological inhibition of PAK4 could recapitulate the results observed in the B16 PAK4 KO tumours, we obtained the PAK4 inhibitor, KPT-9274, from Karyopharm Therapeutics. Indeed, inhibiting PAK4 in combination with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 immunotherapy significantly slowed the growth of the B16 melanomas more than either drug alone.</p> <p><u>Results and Conclusions</u></p> <p>Transcriptomic analysis of melanoma tumors that were well infiltrated by immune cells with those that kept immune cells out revealed a list of genes whose expression differed between the infiltrated and non-infiltrated tumours. The result suggests that p21 activated kinase 4 (PAK4) is enriched in non-responding tumour biopsies with low T cell and dendritic cell infiltration. In addition, PAK4 decreased WNT activity, a signalling pathway that has previously been involved in immune exclusion. In mouse models, genetic deletion of PAK4 increased T cell infiltration and reversed resistance to PD&#8208;1 blockade in a CD8 T cell-dependent manner. Furthermore, combination of with the PAK4 inhibitor, KPT-9274, improved anti&#8208;tumour responses compared to anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 alone. Therefore, high PAK4 expression is correlated with low T cell and dendritic cell infiltration and lack of response to PD&#8208;1 blockade, which could be reversed with PAK4 inhibition. The data establish a rationale for targeting this kinase with inhibitors in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors for patients.</p> <p><u>Future work and data that we can anticipate for this study</u></p> <p>Oncogenic signalling pathways and specially the WNT signalling pathway, have been associated with lack of immune infiltration and resistance to PD&#8208;1 blockade therapies. Here, we show that PAK4 overcome resistance to PD&#8208;1 blockade while significantly decreases WNT signalling activity. Therefore, it constitutes the first potential druggable target that is able to reverse oncogenic driven immune cell exclusion. However, the fully mechanism whereby PAK4 sensitizes tumours to immunotherapy remains to be fully elucidated. It is necessary to address whether PAK4 inhibition overcomes resistance through WNT signalling inhibition or if other signalling pathways are involved in the observed phenotype.</p>",

    "description": "<p>A genome-wide association study (GWAS) of prostate cancer (PCa) was conducted in Kaiser Permanente (KP) Northern California health plan members (7,783 cases, 38,595 controls; 80.3% non-Hispanic white, 4.9% African-American, 7.0% East Asian, and 7.8% Latino) [PMID: 26034056]. The data for these members were drawn from three KP cohort studies: Research Program in Genes, Environment and Health (RPGEH) ProHealth, and California Men's Health Study (CMHS) (described further under Study History). Four custom arrays were designed for genotyping, one for each of the four major race-ethnicity groups in the RPGEH cohort: African Americans, East Asians, Latinos, and Non-Hispanic Whites. The number of SNPs and SNP content varied by array, with SNP content designed to maximize the genome-wide coverage of low frequency and more common variants specific to the different race-ethnicity groups, including newly identified SNPs from sequencing projects, and SNPs with established associations with disease phenotypes and risk factors [PMIDs: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21565264\">21565264</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21903159\">21903159</a>]. Within the total study cohort, n=34,736 completed a consent which permitted deposition of data to NIH.</p> <p>Genotyping followed the same general procedure described in [PMIDs: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=26092718\">26092718</a>, plus additional quality control (QC) steps for the additional men, in order to control for potential batch and kit effects, described in [PMID: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=26034056\">26034056</a>. Briefly, we first repeated the filters described in [PMID: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=26092718\">26092718</a>] for all four arrays (EUR, LAT, EAS, AFR). Then, on an array-wise basis, we removed SNPs with MAF<0.01, with a call rate<95%, or with Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) p-value in homogeneous groups<1x10&#710;-5. Furthermore, on the EUR array, to adjust for potential kit effect, we conducted a GWAS of kit, and removed those kit associated SNPs with p<1x10&#710;-6; we also re-genotyped each of the new samples (those not genotyped with the original GERA data) with some of the original GERA data, and removed SNPs with >13/1,268 (1%) mismatches. For the AFR array, to adjust potential plate batch issues, we conducted a GWAS of whether an individual was in the original GERA data vs. in the newly genotyped data and removed those batch-associated SNPs with p<0.05 (we used a stronger threshold than that used for the EUR array because there were fewer individuals on the AFR array); we also re-genotyped each of the new samples with the original GERA data and removed SNPs with >2/78 (2.6%).</p> <p>After the QC described above, imputation was performed as described in [PMID: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=26034056\">26034056</a>].

A custom EWAS array primarily focused on rare variants was designed for genotyping that complemented the GWAS arrays [PMID: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=26034056\">26034056</a>]. The EWAS array content included missense and loss-of-function mutations, and rare exonic mutations from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and dbGaP prostate cancer tumor exomes [PMID: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=26544944\">26544944</a>; PMID: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21949389\">26544944</a>].

The major goals of our research are to identify novel high-penetrance genes for familial melanoma in melanoma-prone families without known mutations and to identify modifier factors, including genetic and epigenetic, in melanoma-prone families with and without known major mutations. We are using whole exome sequencing to identify additional high-risk susceptibility genes and using targeted sequencing to follow up on the top genes in additional family members and in population-based melanoma cases and controls. We are also using RNASeq to investigate genome-wide allele-specific expression and eQTLs in these families to identify genes with expression alteration, which will provide additional information for gene discovery. In addition, we also conducted genome-wide copy number variation (CNV), methylation, and miRNA expression profiling analyses in our melanoma families with the goal of identifying genetic and epigenetic factors as disease modifiers.</p>",

Studies have suggested that liquid biopsy may better capture the heterogeneity of acquired resistance, but systematic, direct comparisons of post-progression liquid vs. standard single-lesion tumor biopsies are lacking. In a prospective cohort of 44 patients with molecularly-defined gastrointestinal cancers and acquired resistance to targeted therapy, direct comparison of post-progression liquid vs. tumor biopsy revealed that liquid biopsy more frequently identified clinically-relevant resistance alterations and multiple resistance mechanisms, detecting resistance alterations not detected in matched tumor biopsy in 78% of cases. Whole-exome sequencing of serial cell-free DNA, tumor biopsies and rapid autopsy specimens elucidated geographic and evolutionary characteristics of heterogeneity. Our data suggest that acquired resistance is frequently characterized by profound tumor heterogeneity and highlight the potential clinical utility of liquid biopsy.</p> <p> <ol> <li>Burrell, R.

    "description": "<p>Up to 50% of patients with uveal melanoma (UM) develop metastatic disease, for which there is no effective systemic treatment. This study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the orally available protein kinase C inhibitor, AEB071, in patients with metastatic UM, and to perform genomic profiling of metastatic tumor samples, with the aim to propose combination therapies. Metastatic UM patients (n=153) were treated with AEB071 in a Phase I, single-arm study. Patients received total daily doses of AEB071 ranging from 450 to 1400 mg. First-cycle dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were observed in 13 patients (13%). These were most commonly gastrointestinal system toxicities and were dose related, occurring at doses &gt; 700 mg/day. Preliminary clinical activity was observed, with 3% of patients achieving a partial response and 50% with stable disease (median duration 15 weeks). High-depth, targeted next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS) was performed on 89 metastatic tumor biopsy samples. Mutations previously identified in UM were observed, including mutations in GNAQ, GNA11, BAP1, SF3B1, PLCB4, and amplification of chromosome arm 8q. GNAQ/GNA11 mutations were observed at a similar frequency (93%) as previously reported, confirming a therapeutic window for inhibition of the downstream effector PKC in metastatic UM. In conclusion, the protein kinase C inhibitor AEB071 was well tolerated and modest clinical activity was observed in metastatic UM. The genomic findings were consistent with previous reports in primary UM. Together, our data allow envisaging combination therapies of PKC inhibitors with other compounds in metastatic UM.</p>",

    "description": "<p><u>Count Me In - The Angiosarcoma Project: A Patient-Partnered Research Initiative to Accelerate Research in a Rare Sarcoma</u></p> <p>The <a href=\"http://ascproject.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Angiosarcoma Project (ASCproject)</a> is a research study that directly engages angiosarcoma patients online and empowers them to accelerate cancer research by sharing medical information and clinical samples. Angiosarcoma is an exceedingly rare soft tissue sarcoma with an incidence of ~300 newly diagnosed cases per year in the United States. This low incidence has impeded large-scale research efforts in this disease that are strongly needed to catalyze research and improve clinical outcomes. The Angiosarcoma Project, launched in March 2017, has demonstrated the feasibility of directly engaging geographically dispersed patients to democratize research and establish a large patient cohort to characterize the genomic and clinical landscape of a rare disease. Angiosarcoma patients living in the US or Canada can access the study and consent online through an online portal (ASCproject.org). Enrolled patients are mailed saliva and blood draw kits, which can be used to extract germline DNA and cell-free DNA (cfDNA), respectively. The study team contacts participants&#39; healthcare institutions to obtain medical records and a portion of archived tumor samples.

    "description": "<p>Lung adenocarcinoma is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide and a heterogeneous disease with poor survival in the advanced stage. Given that the frequency of early diagnosis is increasing, the investigation of the molecular determinants of disease progression is paramount. Prediction of whether the tumor is indolent or aggressive has been the subject of recent investigations. Yet, the molecular underpinnings explaining the difference in tumor behavior remains largely unknown and is directly relevant to the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of lung cancer screening, including the risks of over-diagnosis and overtreatment.</p> <p>To gain insights into the molecular pathogenesis and the underlying molecular determinants of clinical behavior of early adenocarcinoma, we investigated genetic alterations in 102 surgically resected early adenocarcinomas. We hypothesized that the behavior of early adenocarcinoma can be predicted based on genomic underpinnings. To identify the type of genomic alterations associated with resected indolent and aggressive early lung ADC, the DNA samples from 21 adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS), 27 minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA) and 54 fully invasive adenocarcinoma were collected and subjected to a deep next generation sequencing, targeting a custom 347 cancer gene panel. Our study provides new insights into cancer genomic evolution, helps to elucidate the interplay of somatic mutation and the adaptation of clones, and brings new insights into the key distinction between indolent and aggressive tumor behavior.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The integration of exogenous DNA into the human genome can cause somatic mutations associated with oncogenesis. For example, the insertion of HPV DNA into human chromosomes is the single most important event leading to tumorigenesis in cervical cancer. It is also now preventable with vaccines against HPV. In contrast to viral DNA integrations, the instances and repercussions of bacterial DNA integration into the somatic human genome are less clear. Yet bacterial DNA integrations (BDI) found to be associated with tumorigenesis could also be prevented using therapeutics like vaccines that limit exposure to the bacteria. Previous analysis of publicly available sequencing data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) showed BDIs from Pseudomonas spp. rRNA into the 5&#39;-UTR of four proto-oncogenes as well as in Ig (the immunoglobulin gene) of gastric cancer samples. The original samples from TCGA were not available to validate these findings. Therefore, a different cohort of gastric cancer patients was identified in order to establish the presence BDIs. Whole exome sequencing was completed on seven tumor samples and six adjacent gastric samples, as well as one intestinal metaplasia sample and one non-atrophic gastritis sample. Four of those samples were also investigated with transcriptomics and whole genome sequencing. Given that 15-20% of cancers worldwide are linked to infections, more work is needed to understand the role of infectious agents in oncogenesis and the mechanisms underlying that role.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Pancreatic cancer is the 4th leading cause of cancer deaths in the US. Due to the lack of early symptoms, pancreatic cancer is difficult to identify at early stages and no screening is available for the general population. Identifying pancreatic cancer at earlier stages could significantly improve survival with increased opportunities for surgery. New high-dimensional arrays designed to measure DNA methylation levels at hundreds of thousands of CpG sites throughout the genome have opened opportunities to examine the role of DNA methylation in cancer risk using blood samples. Using this method, archived samples from prospective studies can be used to examine early changes in the DNA methylation levels in individuals who develop cancer months or years later, providing new opportunities to better understand biological mechanisms and, perhaps, identify biomarkers for early detection. Pancreatic cancer cases and matched controls were obtained from 3 large cohort studies, the Nurses&#39; Health Study (NHS), the Physician&#39;s Health Study (PHS), and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS), to measure DNA methylation in stored buffy coats using a nested case-control study design.</p>",

Tumor samples and matched source of germline DNA are curated and processed by the <a href=\"http://cancergenome.nih.gov/abouttcga/overview/howitworks/bcr\" target=\"_blank\">Biospecimen Core Resource</a>, a centralized site that reviews sample data and processes all samples to ensure consistent pathology assessment and generation of molecular analytes (DNA and RNA).</p> <p>TCGA is focusing on primary untreated tumors that were snap frozen upon collection. All tumors must have a matched normal sample from the same patient. In many cases, the matched normal is a sample of the patient&#39;s blood.</p> <p>Once at the BCR, all samples are subjected to a quality control protocol before they are accepted for full analysis into the TCGA pipeline. Each sample is reviewed by a pathologist to confirm the diagnosis and that the sample meets inclusion criteria. Specifically, TCGA requires that samples contain at least 60% tumor nuclei and have less than 20% necrotic tissue. Once the sample passes the pathology review, nucleic acids are isolated and genotyping is performed so that each tumor sample is properly associated with the correct normal tissue. An important goal in establishing this central resource is to ensure that molecular analytes (i.e. DNA and RNA) extracted from tissue samples are of consistent and high quality. Next, these analytes, undergo a molecular quality control process and then are distributed to TCGA <a href=\"http://cancergenome.nih.gov/abouttcga/overview/howitworks/characterizationcenters\" target=\"_blank\">Cancer Genome Characterization Centers</a> and <a href=\"http://cancergenome.nih.gov/abouttcga/overview/howitworks/sequencingcenters\" target=\"_blank\">Genome Sequencing Centers</a> for genomic analysis.</p> <p>All samples in TCGA have been collected and utilized following strict <a href=\"http://cancergenome.nih.gov/abouttcga/policies/policiesguidelines\" target=\"_blank\">policies and guidelines</a> for the protection of human subjects, informed consent and IRB review of protocols.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Metabolic lesions with pleiotropic effects on epigenetic regulation and other cellular processes are widely implicated in cancer, yet their oncogenic mechanisms remain poorly understood. Succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) deficiency causes a subset of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) with DNA hyper-methylation. Here we associate this hyper-methylation with changes in chromosome topology that activate oncogenic programs. To investigate epigenetic alterations in this disease, we systematically mapped DNA methylation, CTCF insulators, enhancers and chromosome topology in KIT-mutant, PDGFRA-mutant and SDH-deficient GISTs. Although these respective subtypes share similar enhancer landscapes, we identified hundreds of putative insulators where DNA methylation replaced CTCF binding in SDH-deficient GISTs. We focused on disrupted insulators that partitions super-enhancers from FGF3, FGF4 and the KIT oncogene. Recurrent loss of this insulator alters locus topology in SDH-deficient GISTs, allowing aberrant physical interaction between enhancers and oncogenes. CRISPR-mediated excision of the corresponding CTCF motif in an SDH-intact model disrupted the boundary and up-regulated FGFs and KIT expression. Our findings reveal how a metabolic lesion destabilizes chromatin structure to facilitate the initiation and selection of epigenetic alterations that drive oncogenic programs in the absence of canonical mutations.</p>",

In early disease stages, MF presents as skin patches and plaques that in some cases may progress to tumor and disperse to lymph nodes and other internal organs. The 10-year overall survival is 50% in advanced stages. Early diagnosis is difficult as the histology overlaps with features of inflammatory skin diseases. Even when the diagnosis is established, there are no prognostic markers that predict whether the disease will be aggressive or indolent. Lastly, there are no curative treatments and MF will invariably relapse, even after aggressive chemotherapy. The disease is a diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic challenge. The main objective of this study is to address the question of tumor heterogeneity in MF. To date, MF is considered to be monoclonal, derived from a transformed, mature memory T-cell. However, clinical observations and preliminary data suggest that MF comprises multiple subclones, which may be of importance for understanding disease evolution and resistance to therapy. We plan to address this objective using Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) of MF tissue prepared by laser microdissection (LMD).</p>",

    "description": "<p>Pilocytic astrocytoma (PA), the most common childhood brain tumor, is a low-grade glioma with a single driver BRAF rearrangement. Here, we perform scRNAseq in six PAs using methods that enabled detection of the rearrangement. When compared to higher-grade gliomas, a strikingly higher proportion of the PA cancer cells exhibit a differentiated, astrocyte-like phenotype. A smaller proportion of cells exhibit a progenitor-like phenotype with evidence of proliferation. These express a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) program that was absent from higher-grade gliomas. Immune cells, especially microglia, comprise 40% of all cells in the PAs and account for differences in bulk expression profiles between tumor locations and subtypes. These data indicate that MAPK signaling is restricted to relatively undifferentiated cancer cells in PA, with implications for investigational therapies directed at this pathway.</p> <p>Note that 931 out of 1234 samples in the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) passed QC and have transcript count data available from the Broad Institute Single Cell Portal.

    "description": "<p>Hepatoblastoma (HB) is the most common pediatric liver tumor, affecting mostly children under 3 years of age. This rare tumor represents 1% of all pediatric cancers. Genetic studies have shown that HB is characterized by high frequency mutations of the CTNNB1 gene encoding beta-catenin (around 75%) and relative genomic stability. Here we have analyzed the transcriptional profile of 21 HBs compared to matched non-tumor livers by Cap Analysis of Gene Expression (CAGE), which provides accurate and quantitative profiling of all transcripts. CAGE analysis revealed strong upregulation of known Wnt target coding genes in most tumors analyzed, consistent with previous transcriptomic studies. To better define the Wnt-dependent transcriptional landscape of HB, we integrated CAGE data with TCF4 ChIP-seq data from a CTNNB1-mutated cancer cell line and with the FANTOM5 genomic coordinates of TCF/LEF binding motifs. Both TCF/LEF binding motifs and ChIP-seq peaks were strongly enriched in the immediate upstream region, not only for protein-coding genes, but also for non-coding transcripts. Among the selected 112 top Wnt target genes at FDR&#60;1.0E-6 and fold change&#62;8, we found clear over-representation (66%) of distant transcription start sites (TSSs) representing lncRNAs and enhancer RNAs, which raises the question of their role in HB pathogenesis. Analysis of the 112 promoters using CAGEd-oPOSSUM confirmed the predominant involvement of Tcf/Lef transcription factors, together with HNF4G, GATA2, Sox3 and Ets-related genes. Finally, the 112 Wnt target signature defined 3 tumor subclasses, T1, T2 and T3, characterized by progressive alteration of the non-coding part of the transcriptome and significant differences in clinical behavior.</p>",

A few sequencing studies performed on limited number of samples have revealed potential disease-driving genes in SCLC, however, much still remains unknown, particularly in the Asian patient population. Here we conducted whole exome sequencing (WES) and transcriptomic sequencing of primary tumors from 99 Chinese SCLC patients. Dysregulation of tumor suppressor genes TP53 and RB1 was observed in 82% and 62% of SCLC patients, respectively, and more than half of the SCLC patients (62%) harbored TP53 and RB1 mutation and/or copy number loss. Additionally, Serine/Arginine Splicing Factor 1 (SRSF1) DNA copy number gain and mRNA over-expression was strongly associated with poor survival using both discovery and validation patient cohorts. Functional studies in vitro and in vivo demonstrate that SRSF1 is important for tumorigenicity of SCLC and may play a key role in DNA repair and chemo-sensitivity. These results strongly support SRSF1 as a prognostic biomarker in SCLC and provide a rationale for personalized therapy in SCLC.</p> <p>The manuscript has been accepted by Plos Genetics.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Clonal dynamics during metastasis were studied in two patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models established from treatment-naive primary breast tumors from TNBC patients diagnosed with concurrent metastatic disease. Genomic sequencing and barcode-mediated clonal tracking revealed robust alterations in clonal architecture between primary tumors and metastases. Polyclonal seeding and maintenance of low-abundance subclones was observed in each metastatic lesion examined. Lung, liver, and brain metastases were enriched for an identical population of subclones. Clones dominating multi-organ metastases shared a genomic lineage. Thus, properties of rare mammary tumor subclones enabled the seeding and colonization of metastases in multiple secondary organ sites.</p> <p>In this study, patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of treatment-naive TNBC and serial biopsies from TNBC patients undergoing NACT were used to elucidate mechanisms of chemoresistance in the neoadjuvant setting. Barcode-mediated clonal tracking and genomic sequencing of PDX tumors revealed that residual tumors remaining after chemotherapy maintained the subclonal architecture of untreated tumors yet their transcriptomes, proteomes, and histologic features were distinct from those of untreated tumors. Once treatment was halted, residual tumors gave rise to chemotherapy-sensitive tumors with similar transcriptomes, proteomes, and histological features to those of untreated tumors. Taken together, these results demonstrated that tumors can adopt a reversible drug-tolerant state that does not involve clonal selection as a chemotherapy resistance mechanism. Serial biopsies obtained from patients with TNBC undergoing NACT revealed similar histologic changes as well as maintenance of stable subclonal architecture, demonstrating that PDXs capture molecular features characteristic of human TNBC chemoresistance. </p>",

    "description": "<p>Fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma (FL-HCC) is a very rare and distinct subtype of hepatocellular carcinoma that occurs in the previously healthy livers of adolescents and young adults. The low incidence rate has kept FL-HCC an understudied cancer, thus the list of FL-HCC markers is limited and the genetic alterations driving its growth have remained unknown. In order to gain a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying FL-HCC initiation and progression, we performed an in-depth genomic analyses of one tumor followed by immunohistochemistry validation on seven other tumors. We showed the expression of neuroendocrine markers in FL-HCC. In addition, DNA/RNA sequencing revealed that common cancer pathways are not visibly altered in FL-HCC but identified two novel structural variants, both resulting in fusion transcripts. Through in vitro studies, we demonstrated the oncogenic properties of these fusion transcripts. These experiments further highlight the tumorigenic role of gene fusions in the etiology of pediatric solid tumors and identify both candidate biomarkers and possible therapeutic targets for this lethal pediatric disease.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Pathways Study (NCI R01 CA105274, PI: Kushi), is a prospective cohort study of a diverse population of recently diagnosed breast cancer survivors in KPNC. The aims are to examine the effect on recurrence and survival of 1) lifestyle factors such as diet, physical activity, and use of complementary and alternative therapies and 2) molecular factors such as biomarkers of inflammation and tumor DNA methylation profiles. Recruitment into the cohort was from January 2006 to May 2013. Baseline data collection was by in-person interview (on average two months post-diagnosis), with follow-up via mailed or phone questionnaires at 6, 24, and 72 months and outcomes and comorbidities at 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96 months post-enrollment. The Pathways Study is now funded through May 2021 as a cancer cohort infrastructure grant (U01 CA195565, MPI: Kushi/Ambrosone). The Pathways baseline interview consists of interviewer- and self-administered questionnaires. Interviewer-administered questionnaires collected information including demographics, family health history, pregnancy health history, menstrual history, history of breast care screening procedures, smoking history, hormone use, medication history, and vitamin and mineral use. Self-administered questionnaires collected information on diet, physical activity, CAM use, lymphedema, and psychosocial and quality of life measures.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common form of acute leukemia in adults and is expected to increase in frequency as the population ages. Most subtypes of AML are difficult to treat, in part due to a lack of understanding of possible molecular targets. Furthermore, the peak incidence of AML is in the sixth decade, and patients over the age of 65 do not tolerate chemotherapeutic regimens well. Moreover, AML has been highly studied as a model for other cancers. An RNA Biology Program is established aiming to develop comprehensive datasets through the profiling of all different classes of RNA expression, RNA editing, alternative splicing, and non-coding RNAs in CD34&#43; normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSC), their differentiated progeny, and AML clinical samples that could be utilized to understand leukemia.</p> <p>These datasets will allow us to computationally identify and characterize various RNA species and processes to enable the development of effective therapeutics to AML, leukemia and other types of cancers. Epigenetic factors such as methylation and histone modifications will also be characterized from these clinical samples allowing for integrated dataset analysis to look at the cross-talk between RNA and DNA/epigenomics in leukemia.</p> <p>The following is a subsidiary study of the above study description where whole genome sequencing was performed on two collected AML patients&#39; samples using Illumina and Oxford Nanopore sequencing technologies. The aim is to characterize the roles of structural variants (SV) in RNA biology which are potentially important for AML development using our own established long-read SV characterization tool, NanoVar.</p> <p>The advent of Oxford Nanopore sequencing technologies has opened a new avenue for better SV characterization by having longer sequencing reads. NanoVar is an accurate and rapid SV characterization tool that utilizes low-depth Nanopore sequencing data. NanoVar makes use of split-reads and hard-clipped reads for SV discovery and employs a simulation-trained neural network classifier for true positive enrichment. NanoVar exhibited higher accuracy and faster computational speed amongst other long-read SV detection tools in simulated data. In AML patient data, NanoVar displayed excellent accuracy in SV characterization (16/16 SVs validated in two patients) by using only 4x depth sequencing data. In summary, NanoVar improves the accuracy and speed of SV characterization at a lower sequencing cost, an approach compatible with clinical studies.</p>",

Although HCL and the SH both share common gene mutations in BRAF (BRAFV600E) and MAP2K1, these are distinct blood cancers with different clinical behaviors; however, their actual developmental cellular origins, genomic, and pathogenic differences are poorly understood, which led to our project goal of determining how BRAFV600E, MAP2K1, and other MAPK pathway mutations contribute to the pathogenesis of distinct blood cancers and affect their clinical responses to MAPK pathway inhibitors. This study proposal seeks to advance our understanding of the actual cells of origin of cancer-causing MAPK mutations in HCL and the SH, to determine why BRAFV600E and MAP2K1 mutations can cause two distinct blood cancers, and to understand how these mutations in HCL and SH influence responses to MAPK pathway inhibitor drugs and other receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitors such as RET and ALK inhibitors that could potentially become effective therapy for these poorly understood blood cancers. </p>",

Patients received 5 mg/kg bevacizumab every two weeks followed by FOLFOX or FOLFIRI every two weeks. Blood pressure was measured prior to randomization, at day 1 of each eight week treatment cycle, and every two weeks during treatment. Serious adverse events, including hypertension, were reported during each treatment cycle. The severity of hypertension was assessed on a scale of 1-5 according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3. DNA was available from patients who were also enrolled in a pharmacogenetic companion study (CALGB 60501) embedded within CALGB 80405.</p> <p>Cases and controls were selected to compare severe, early-onset hypertension patients to those with no reported hypertension.

The goal is to create a publicly available dataset of genomic, molecular, clinical, and patient-reported data to enable research. Patients in the US or Canada may register online. Registered patients are sent an online consent form that asks for permission to obtain and analyze their medical records, tumor tissue, saliva, and blood samples. Once enrolled, patients are sent a saliva kit and asked to mail back a saliva sample, which is used to extract germline DNA. Study staff contact participants&#39; medical providers and obtain medical records and a portion of their stored tumor biopsies. Patients may be asked to mail in a blood sample, which is used to extract cell free DNA (cfDNA). Whole exome sequencing (WES) is performed on tumor DNA, germline DNA, and cfNDA; transcriptome sequencing is performed on tumor RNA. Clinically annotated genomic data are used to study specific patient cohorts (including outliers) and to identify mechanisms of response and resistance to therapies.

    "report_name": "Discovering the Genetic Basis of Human Neuroblastoma: A Gabriella Miller Kids First Pediatric Research Program (Kids First) Project",
    "description": "<p>Children with disseminated neuroblastoma have a very high risk of treatment failure and death despite receiving intensified chemotherapy, radiation therapy and immunotherapy. The <i>long-term goal</i> of our research program is to ultimately improve neuroblastoma cure rates by first comprehensively defining the genetic basis of the disease. The <i>central hypothesis</i> to be tested here is that neuroblastoma arises largely due to the epistatic interaction of common and rare heritable DNA variation. Here we will perform a comprehensive whole genome sequencing of 563 quartets of neuroblastoma patient germline and diagnostic tumor DNAs and germline DNAs from both parents. The case series was recently collected through a Children's Oncology Group epidemiology clinical trial and is robustly annotated with complete demographic (age, sex, race, ethnicity), clinical (e.g. age at diagnosis, stage, risk group), epidemiologic (parental dietary and exposure questionnaire) and biological (e.g. tumor <i>MYCN</i> status and multiple other tumor genomic measures) co-variates. Subjects were consented for genetic research and DNA is immediately available for shipment for sequencing. We propose Illumina-based whole genome sequencing in the 593 \"trio\" germline samples (<b>Aim 1</b>; due to missing parent: 487 full neuroblastoma triads, 106 child-single parent dyads = 1673 whole genome sequences) and matched diagnostic tumor DNA (<b>Aim 2</b>; N=366) at 30x sequencing depth (N=2039 whole genome sequences). Also in Aim 2 we will perform whole exome (100x) and RNA sequencing on the 366 tumor DNA and 228 tumor RNA samples from this cohort. Finally, we propose a pilot study of structural variation using long-range sequencing in 10 non-overlapping tumor samples chosen based on potentially relevant chromosomal alterations discovered with conventional NGS. Thus, a total of 2277 individual samples and 2655 sequences will be generated. We will use our established analytic pipeline that is currently being used to study the germline genomes of all cases sequenced through the NCI supported Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments program. We plan a three-stage analytic approach, first focusing on classic <i>de novo</i> and inherited Mendelian damaging alterations. We will next integrate our extensive epigenomic data from human neuroblastoma cell lines and genome-wide association study data (N=5,703 neuroblastoma cases to date) to guide a comprehensive assessment of noncoding variants that influence tumor initiation with a recently established analytic pipeline. Finally, we will utilize the tumor DNA analyses to inform relevance via somatic gain or loss of function effects at the sequence and/or copy number levels. All data generated in this project will be immediately placed into the Genomic Data Commons (GDC) and we will compute within this environment by importing our analytic pipelines into the GDC. These data will be fully integrated into the Kids First Data Resource and freely shared with all academically qualified petitioners. This comprehensive data set derived from a large and richly phenotyped series of neuroblastoma DNA quartets will be integrated with existing germline and/or tumor genomic data from over 6,000 neuroblastoma subjects (but none with matched patient-parent germline sequencing data) to provide an unparalleled opportunity to comprehensively discover the genetic basis of neuroblastoma.<br></p>",

    "description": "<p>The case set is from a case-control study designed to identify common genetic risk factors for multiple myeloma in African Americans, the population with the highest risk for this cancer. We conducted two GWAS and combined each of these with convenience controls consisting of unaffected African American participants in cohorts with existing GWAS data. We then conducted a meta-analysis of the two sets. Cases were persons of African ancestry with smoldering or active multiple myeloma identified at participating oncology clinics or through SEER registries, as part of the African American Multiple Myeloma Study (AAMMS) diagnosed from Jan 1, 1988 through July 31, 2016. The majority of the samples were collected from incident and prevalent cases diagnosed since Jan 1, 2008 (80.9%), with a minority obtained from biobanks from cases diagnosed prior to 2008 (19.1%). Additional samples were obtained from the Multiethnic Cohort (USC and University of Hawaii) (n=40), the University of California at San Francisco Multiple Myeloma Study (n=27), and from the Multiple Myeloma Research Consortium for secondary analysis (samples originally provided to MMRC by 8 additional sites (n=84)). We have identified the phenotype (smoldering myeloma, plasma cell multiple myeloma, or myeloma not otherwise specified (myeloma NOS) when myeloma phenotype was not known), sex and age at diagnosis in this data set. The initial GWAS set consisted of 1308 (1,305 passed QC) cases with DNA samples, with a GWAS performed on the Illumina Human Core. Controls consisted of 7,078 unaffected African American subjects who were participants in the African American Prostate and Breast Consortium, with existing GWAS data from the Illumina1M Duo BeadChip. The second GWAS set consisted of 529 African American multiple myeloma patients with samples (406 from University of Arkansas, results not contained in this dataset because NCI funds were not used for the collection and genotyping) with GWAS data resulting from the Illumina Mega-BeadChip v1.1. Controls were 2,390 unaffected African American participants in the Multiethnic Cohort with existing GWAS data from the same array. After QC and removal of duplicates within sets, sex mismatches, and removal of plasmacytoma cases (ICD-0 code 9731), this deposited data set contains the typed GWAS data for the Illumina Human Core (set 1) (n=1298), and for the MegaBead Chip v1.1 (set 2) (n=123), with the University of Arkansas samples removed, for a total of 1,421 case genotypes.

    "report_name": "Using Genomics to Reduce Breast Cancer Disparities in the African Diaspora",
    "description": "<p>Differences in breast cancer incidence and mortality rates between North American Caucasian and African American women are well-described and transcend socioeconomic issues. Black women are diagnosed with breast cancer at a younger median age; have more clinically aggressive disease and stage-for-stage; and have higher mortality rates than age-matched Caucasian women. Black women in West Africa, the origin of the slave trade in the US in the 19th century and thus the founder population for most African Americans, have even higher rates of early-onset, poor-prognosis breast cancer than African American women. Racial difference in the distribution of intrinsic molecular subtypes has been well characterized in the US and throughout the African Diaspora as well. Despite the large efforts on characterizing racial/ethnic differences, however, the reasons women of African ancestry are disproportionately affected by breast cancer incidence and mortality remain poorly understood - largely due to paucity of data on inherent genomic differences that contribute to the disparities in incidence and progression of breast cancer across populations. </p> <p>West Africa Breast Cancer Study (WABCS) is an initiative that aims to comprehensively understand the genetic architecture of breast cancer in West Africans, the founder population of a large proportion of black women in the United States. The objective of the study was to provide a better understanding of the molecular genetic factors that influence prognosis in Nigerian breast cancer patients, and determine which of these alterations may be amenable to available therapy. To that end, we examined the molecular features of breast cancers of indigenous African women using a combination of whole-genome, whole-exome, and transcriptome sequencing (WGS, WES, and RNA-seq) on 194 tumors from Nigerian patients.</p> <p>The goal of this project was to obtain answers to two related research questions using an unscreened population without genetic admixture in Nigeria: 1) why are women of African ancestry more likely to develop aggressive young onset breast cancer? 2) What are the associated genomic and non-genomic risk factors? <i>We hypothesize that the genomic determinants of breast cancer molecular subtypes in women of African ancestry are also molecular drivers of tumor progression and represent targets for interventions to improve clinical outcomes and close the mortality gap.</i></p> <p>By identifying causal links between genetic variants that promote aggressive tumor progression in Nigerian women in comparison to women from different population found in TCGA and ICGC, the present dataset will have significant public health impact on millions of women in the African Diaspora. The potential to identify novel pathways for interventions to reduce the increasing mortality gap between women of African and European ancestry is huge</p>",
    "history": "<p>WABCS was embedded within the larger Nigerian Breast Cancer Study (NBCS), which is a case-control genetic epidemiological study of breast cancer started in Ibadan, Nigeria through a collaboration between the University of Chicago and the University of Ibadan. The feasibilty phase of the study took place between 1998 and 2001 and was funded by the US Department of Defense Breast Cancer program. Phase 1 was funded with an R01 from the NCI between 2002 and 2010, and Phase II was funded through 4-Way partnership with Novartis Biomedical Research Institute and funding from Susan G Komen Scholar and Breast Cancer Research Foundation between 2011 and 2018.</p> <p>Following the 1st International Workshop on Breast and Cervical Cancer held in Lagos in 2004, we established a breast cancer laboratory within the Institute for Medical Research and Training at the University of Ibadan College of Medicine, to provide core research support and clinical services to all Nigerian medical institutions. This laboratory serves as central repository for our investigations. Staff were trained on best practice for tissue preparation and processing of FFPE tissues according to maintain high quality and integrity of the biospecimens.</p> <p>In 2013, the study protocol was updated to prepare for new study methods involving high-throughput massively parallel sequencing approaches. The Standard Operating Procedures were revised after studying the best practices in the field including TCGA to improve efficiency of patient recruitment and sample collection quality. The study was also expanded to include a new site in Lagos, Nigeria.</p> <p>Samples from the Nigerian Breast Cancer Study was used to conduct a Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS) of 1,973 cases and 2,283 controls, all of African ancestry. In 2012, The Root GWAS dataset was released to dbGaP for community access (accession phs000383.v1.p1).</p>",
    "inclusion_criteria": "<p> <p><u>Case ascertainment:</u></p> <p>Tumors from consecutive patients with breast cancer recruited between February 2013 and September 2015 at the University College Hospital (UCH) in Ibadan, and Lagos State University Teaching Hospital (LASUTH) in Lagos, Nigeria, were used for sequencing. Patients with breast cancer aged 18 and above, who were clinically diagnosed in the Department of Surgery of UCH or Department of Surgery of LASUTH were eligible for this study. All consecutive eligible cases were approached. After obtaining informed consent, patients were interviewed and completed epidemiologic questionnaires administered by a trained nurse. Diagnostic biopsies as well as blood and additional biopsy samples for subsequent experiments were collected during recruitment.</p> <p>UCH is the premier university teaching hospital in Nigeria, and offers tertiary level care to Oyo State (population of 5.6 million) and parts of the neighboring three states (Osun, Ogun, and Kwara states, with a combined population of 9.4 million). LASUTH is a state-run tertiary health facility that serves over 10 million people of Lagos metropolis. Both hospitals are referral centers for other hospitals in the region, where primary health centers and practicing doctors in the community refer patients to UCH and LASUTH for specialist care. Based on referral patterns, the majority of the cases of breast cancer diagnosed in the region would probably be seen at the UCH and a significant majority at LASUTH. Large proportion of patients present with advanced, non-resectable forms of the disease.</p> <p><u>Control ascertainment:</u></p> <p>The Nigerian Breast Cancer Study has been in the field since 1998. A population-based control recruitment strategy was used. A stable, socio-economically diverse community adjoining the UCH was randomly selected by ballot from a list of all the communities in the area. It is our belief that if anyone in any of these communities were to develop breast cancer, the person will attend the Oncology Clinics at UCH. A census register of the people living in the community was obtained and a meeting was arranged with the Head and Elders of the community, at which the purpose of the study was explained to them. After they consented, meetings were held in the local gathering places at which the purpose of the research was explained to members of the community. Names were then randomly selected from the community register and the people were invited to visit a clinic set up in the community for the study.</p> <p>Inclusion criteria for the controls were: females, age above 18 years, absence of any type of cancer or history of cancer at recruitment, predominant urban residence for most of their lives, and ability to give informed consent. After explaining the project to the potential participant, a complete physical examination was done. A trained nurse then interviewed the participants, measured their height and weight and completed the questionnaires.</p></p>",

    "description": "<p>When undergoing treatment for breast cancer, many women experience severe side effects, some of which result in treatment-related death and some that can persist for years. Little is understood regarding factors that may predict drug toxicities. Pharmacogenetics, the investigation of variants in candidate genes in drug metabolism pathways, has been used to determine susceptibility to treatment-related toxicities, as well as to cancer recurrence. Although there have been some strong and important findings using this approach, such as identification of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that predispose to side effects associated with thiopurines and irinotecan, there has been less progress in assessment of genetic variants that predispose to toxicities resulting from the multi-drug regimen commonly used to treat breast cancer, anthracyclines (A), cyclophosphamide (C), and taxanes (T). These difficulties in identification of key gene variants may be due to the complex metabolic pathways of these drugs, the lack of rate limiting enzymes in the processes, or the limitations of single SNP analysis, rather than capturing all of the variability across the genes.</p> <p>In addition to drug metabolism pathways, however, there may be a number of constitutional factors or other processes that affect damage to normal tissues in the course of chemotherapy, some known or hypothesized, such as DNA repair and oxidative stress pathways, and others not yet discovered. However, there have been no clear candidate genes that account for a large part of the variation in drug or treatment response, and there are likely important genes that influence sensitivity of cells to chemotherapy through unknown pathways which have not yet been identified or hypothesized. The present technological capabilities to screen the entire genome for variants that discriminate populations allows the opportunity to identify these as yet unknown pathways, and open the doors to exciting new avenues of research into mechanisms that had not been previously considered.</p> <p>We conducted a genome-wide scan (GWAS) in a clinical trial (S0221), in which women with high risk breast cancer were treated with different dosing schedules of C, A and T. Blood specimens were collected and banked, and DNA extracted for genotyping on the Illumina OMNI 1M platform. The GWAS data were used to examine genetic variants significantly associated with grades 3 and 4 toxicities, including peripheral neuropathy recorded during the T segment. In S0221, toxicities were graded according to the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE). The neurotoxicity is predominantly a distal sensory neuropathy, which is characterized by pain, numbness, tingling, and reduced functional capacity in the extremities. Other symptoms include parasthesias, ataxia, impaired vibration and joint position sense, and loss of tendon reflexes. By using a GWAS approach, it is likely that important pathways not previously considered can be revealed as important in susceptibility to treatment-related toxicities, identifying those at greatest risk for alternate drugs or dose reduction, and opening new areas of research for prevention of taxanes-related neuropathy among patients receiving chemotherapy for breast cancer. </p>",

    "description": "<p>We have used a &#34;chemistry first&#34; approach to discover druggable acquired vulnerabilities that arised in the pathogenesis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We screened chemical libraries (&#126;200,000 compounds) for chemical toxins that killed subsets of NSCLC but not normal human lung epithelial cells (HBECs). We first screened a panel of 12 NSCLC lines that represented a variety of known oncogenotypes and identified chemicals with large Z scores and appropriate properties including re-supply, chemistry, and reproducible drug response phenotypes. This was then narrowed down to a list of 202 chemicals and 18 drugs with known targeting (henceforth called &#34;Precision Oncology Probe Set&#34;, or POPS). These, and a panel of 30 clinically available drugs, targeted therapies, and drug combinations, already in use or in trials for NSCLC treatment, were then tested on a panel of 96 NSCLC lines for their drug response phenotypes in 12-point dose response curves. This information was analyzed using scanning ranked KS (Kolmogorov-Smirnov) and elastic net biostatistics approaches to identify molecular biomarkers (mutations, mRNA expression, copy number variation, protein expression, and metabolomics) which could predict for sensitivity or resistance to a particular chemical toxin or treatment regimen. From this we have discovered that: our approach identifies already known molecular biomarker of drug sensitivities (e.g. EGFR mutations and EGFR TK inhibitors); many clinically available chemotherapy agents have molecular biomarkers predicting preclinical model drug responses; the POP set of chemical toxins provides novel drug response phenotype patterns in the large NSCLC panel different from those found with clinically available agents including a therapeutic window; many of the POP toxins only hit a small percentage (&#126;5%) of the NSCLC panel but the POP set as a whole provides &#34;coverage&#34; of the entire NSCLC panel; there are simple, one or 2 component molecular biomarkers (mutations, mRNA expression) that predict responses to the different chemical toxins in the NSCLC panel; and that the molecular biomarkers provide some information on the targets and pathways involved in response to the chemical toxins. Thus, we have identified a group of chemical toxins with selectivity for subsets of NSCLC and associated tumor molecular biomarkers to facilitate their development for precision medicine, and also, in some cases, information on the targets and pathways interdicted by these chemical compounds. In addition, we have discovered NSCLC predictive biomarkers for clinically available agents.</p>",

    "report_name": "Defining T cell States Associated with Response to Checkpoint Immunotherapy in Melanoma",
    "description": "<p>Checkpoint blockade therapy using antibodies targeting CTLA4, PD1 or PDL1 have changed the way cancer patients with advanced disease are being treated, as evident by their FDA approval in a wide variety of malignancies, and their ability to induce high response rates when compared to conventional therapies (e.g. chemotherapy). However, even in melanoma, despite the high response rate, most patients are refractory to therapy or acquire resistance in 10-12 months. To identify key immunological elements coupled with response or resistance to checkpoint immunotherapy, we performed an unbiased analysis on 16,291 CD45&#43; immune cells from 32 patients (48 samples) treated with checkpoint therapy (anti-PD1&#61;37; anti-PD1/CTLA4&#61;11), using single cell transcriptomics. Initial unsupervised clustering of all CD45&#43; cells identified 11 clusters. When examining the association of these clusters with clinical outcome, we found that two clusters (B-cells, p&#61;0.005; memory T-cells, p&#61;0.03) were significantly enriched in responder lesions while 4 clusters (monocytes/macrophages, p&#61;0.003; dendritic cells, p&#61;0.015; exhausted CD8&#43; T-cells, p&#61;0.005; and exhausted/cell-cycle lymphocytes, 1.3x10<sup>-5</sup>) are enriched in non-responder lesions. Next, by leveraging our unbiased single cell approach, we identified not only clusters but also specific markers associated with either responder lesions (PLAC8, LTB, LY9, SELL, TCF7, IGKC and CCR7) or non-responder ones (CCL3, CD38, HAVCR2, ENTPD1 and WARS), many of which were not previously reported to be associated with clinical outcome to checkpoint therapy. Due to the importance of CD8&#43; T-cells in controlling tumors, the significant association of T-cell states with clinical outcome, and their high abundance in melanoma tumors, we next focused our analysis on CD8&#43; T-cells and identified 2 main clusters CD8_G (with increased expression of genes linked to memory) and CD8_B (enriched for genes linked to cell dysfunction), that were significantly enriched in responder (CD8_G, p&#61;1.4x10<sup>-6</sup>) and non-responder (CD8_B, p&#61;0.005) lesions, respectively. Since cells with both states coexist in each of the responder and non-responder lesions, we decided to calculate the ratio between the number of cells in these 2 clusters and observed a significant separation between responders (CD8_G/CD8_B&#62;1) and non-responders (CD8_G/CD8_B&#60;1) when looking at all samples, baseline or post samples separately. Similar results were detected when looking at the expression of a single transcription factor, TCF7, in CD8 T-cells in an independent cohort (n&#61;43) using a simple immunofluorescence assay. Additionally, we validated the identity and function of some of the newly identified cell states as well as their epigenetic landscape, and found that cells expressing the inhibitory molecules CD39 and TIM3, on top of being enriched in non-responder lesions, are likely to play a crucial role in T-cell exhaustion in melanoma. Collectively, our study provides extensive unbiased data in human tumors for discovery of predictors and therapeutic targets to checkpoint immunotherapy.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are major players in the progression and drug resistance of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). CAFs constitute a diverse cell population consisting of several recently described subtypes, although the extent of CAF heterogeneity has remained undefined. Here we employ single-cell RNA-sequencing to thoroughly characterize the neoplastic and tumor microenvironment content of human PDAC tumors. Six human PDAC tumor specimens from six patients were collected, and processed for single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis. Adjacent-normal pancreas tissue was also collected from two of the patients. Tumor samples were digested, and fluorescence-activated cell sorting was used to isolate viable cells. For one tumor sample, viable, CD45-negative, CD31-negative, and EpCAM-negative cells were also isolated to enrich for CAFs. The 10X Chromium platform was then used to isolate single cells for RNA-sequencing analysis. This work has demonstrated the differences in immune cell populations between adjacent-normal and tumor tissues, and identified subpopulations of epithelial cells and CAFs present in PDAC tumors. This high-throughput analysis is a resource to better understand the cell populations present in PDAC, and may ultimately aid in the development of more effective therapies for this deadly malignancy.</p>",

Every subject has had a genetic evaluation, including a pedigree analysis for a family history of clefting and other birth defects, a pregnancy history for environmental exposures, and a complete physical exam to rule out suspected or known syndromes or environmental phenocopies. Sequencing was done by the Broad Institute sequencing center funded by the Kids First program (grant number U24-HD090743). The case in each of the Kids First OFC trios has cleft lip (CL, Figure A below), cleft palate (CP, Figure B), or both (CL+CP, Figure C):<br></p> <img src=\"GetImage.cgi?study_id=phs001420&amp;image_name=GMKFCleft.jpg\"> <p>OFCs are genetically complex structural birth defects caused by genetic factors, environmental exposures, and their interactions. OFCs are the most common craniofacial anomalies in humans, affecting approximately 1 in 700 newborns, and are one of the most common structural birth defects worldwide. On average a child with an OFC initially faces feeding difficulties, undergoes 6 surgeries, spends 30 days in hospital, receives 5 years of orthodontic treatment, and participates in ongoing speech therapy, leading to an estimated total lifetime treatment cost of about $200,000. Further, individuals born with an OFC have higher infant mortality, higher mortality rates at all other stages of life, increased incidence of mental health problems, and higher risk for other disorders (notably including breast, brain, and colon cancers). Prior genome-wide linkage and association studies have now identified at least 18 genomic regions likely to contribute to the risk for nonsyndromic OFCs. Despite this substantial progress, the functional/pathogenic variants at OFC-associated regions are mostly still unknown. Because previous OFC genomic studies (genome-wide linkage, genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and targeted sequencing) are based on relatively sparse genotyping data, they cannot distinguish between causal variants and variants in linkage disequilibrium with unobserved causal variants. Moreover, it is unknown whether the association or linkage signals are due to single common variants, haplotypes of multiple common variants, clusters of multiple rare variants, or some combination. Finally, we cannot yet attribute specific genetic risk to individual cases and case families. <b><i>Therefore, the goal of the current study is identify specific OFC risk variants in Latin American families by performing whole genome sequencing of parent-case trios.</i></b></p>",

Further, individuals born with an OFC have higher infant mortality, higher mortality rates at all other stages of life, increased incidence of mental health problems, and higher risk for other disorders (notably including breast, brain, and colon cancers).</p> <p>In order to understand the etiology of these common birth defects, the investigators involved in this collaboration (University of Pittsburgh, University of Iowa, and Johns Hopkins University) have recruited large numbers of OFC case families and controls, recruited from many countries world-wide, over the course of many years of collaborative studies. </p> <p>For the current Kids First project whole genome sequencing (WGS) will be performed in 415 case-parent trios of European descent included form the USA (Pennsylvania, Iowa, Texas, Missouri, Colorado) and international sites (Denmark, Hungary, Spain, Turkey). </p>",

    "report_name": "Clinical Resistance to Crenolanib in Acute Myeloid Leukemia Due to Diverse Molecular Mechanisms",
    "description": "<p>FLT3 mutations are commonly detected in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) patients and are associated with poor prognosis. Crenolanib, a potent type I pan-FLT3 (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=FLT3\" target=\"_blank\">GeneID:2322</a>) inhibitor, is effective against both internal tandem duplications (ITD) and resistance-conferring tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) mutations. While crenolanib monotherapy has demonstrated significant clinical benefit in heavily pretreated relapsed/refractory AML patients, responses are transient and relapse eventually occurs. To investigate the mechanisms of crenolanib resistance, we performed whole exome sequencing of AML patient samples before and after crenolanib treatment (122 samples from 59 patients). Unlike other FLT3 inhibitors, crenolanib did not induce FLT3 activation loop mutations, and mutations of the FLT3 &#34;gatekeeper&#34; residue were infrequent. Instead, mutations of NRAS (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NRAS\" target=\"_blank\">GeneID:4893</a>) and IDH2 (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=IDH2\" target=\"_blank\">GeneID:3418</a>) arose, mostly as FLT3-independent subclones, while TET2 (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=TET2\" target=\"_blank\">GeneID:54790</a>) and IDH1 (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=IDH1\" target=\"_blank\">GeneID:3417</a>) predominantly co-occurred with the FLT3-mutant clone and were enriched in crenolanib poor-responders. The remaining patients exhibited post-crenolanib expansion of mutations associated with epigenetic regulators, transcription factors, and cohesion factors, suggesting diverse non-FLT3 genetic/epigenetic mechanisms of crenolanib resistance. Drug combinations in experimental models restored crenolanib sensitivity.</p>",

    "report_name": "Uncovering the Genetic Architecture of Colorectal Cancer with Focus of Rare and Less Frequent Variants",
    "description": "<p>The Genetics and Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer Consortium (GECCO) is a collaborative effort comprised of a coordinating center and scientific researchers from well-characterized cohort and case-control studies conducted in North America and Europe. This international consortium aims to accelerate the discovery of common and rare genetic risk variants for colorectal cancer by conducting large-scale meta-analyses of existing and newly generated genome-wide association study (GWAS) data, replicating and fine-mapping of GWAS discoveries, and investigating how genetic risk variants are modified by environmental risk factors. To expand these efforts, we assembled case-control sets or nested case-control sets from 20 different North American or European studies. Summary descriptions and study participant inclusions/exclusion criteria for each of these studies are detailed below.</p> <p><b>The Black Women&#39;s Health Study (BWHS): </b><br/> Is the largest follow-up study of the health of African-American women (Cozier et al., 2004; Rosenberg et al., 1995) [PMID: 15018884; PMID: 7722208]. The purpose is to identify and evaluate causes and preventives of cancers and other serious illnesses in African-American women. Among the diseases being studied are breast cancer, colorectal cancer, type 2 diabetes, uterine fibroids, systemic lupus erythematosus, and cardiovascular disease. The study began in 1995, when 59,000 black women from all parts of the United States enrolled through postal questionnaires. The women provided demographic and health data on the 1995 baseline questionnaire, including information on weight, height, smoking, drinking, contraceptive use, use of other selected medications, illnesses, reproductive history, physical activity, diet, use of health care, and other factors. The participants are followed through biennial questionnaires to determine the occurrence of cancers and other illnesses and to update information on risk factors. Self-reports of cancer are confirmed through medical records and state cancer registry records. Mouthwash-swish samples, as a source of DNA, were obtained from &#126;26,000 BWHS participants in 2002-2007. DNA was isolated from the mouthwash-swish samples at the Boston University Molecular Core Genetics Laboratory using the QIAAMP DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen). All incident colorectal cancer cases with a DNA sample were included in the present analysis. Two controls per case, selected from among BWHS participants free of colorectal cancer at end of follow-up, were matched to cases on year of birth (&#43;/- 2 years) and geographical region of residence (Northeast, South, Midwest, and West). A total 209 colorectal cancer cases and 423 controls were sent for genotyping. </p> <p><b>Campaign Against Cancer and Heart Disease (CLUE II):</b><br/> The Campaign Against Cancer and Heart Disease, is a prospective cohort designed to identify biomarkers and other factors associated with risk of cancer, heart disease, and other conditions (Kakourou et al., 2015) [PMID: 26220152]. 32,894 participants were recruited from May through October 1989 from Washington County, Maryland and surrounding communities. Colorectal cancer cases (n &#61; 297) and matched controls (n &#61; 296) were identified between 1989 and 2000 among participants in the CLUE II cohort of Washington County, Maryland. </p> <p><b>Colorectal Cancer Study of Austria (CORSA):</b><br/> In the ongoing colorectal cancer study of Austria (CORSA), more than 13,000 Caucasian participants have been recruited within the province-wide screening project &#34;Burgenland Prevention Trial of Colorectal Disease with Immunological Testing&#34; (B-PREDICT) since 2003 (Hofer et al., 2011) [PMID: 21422235]. All inhabitants of the Austrian province Burgenland aged between 40 and 80 years are annually invited to participate in fecal immunochemical testing and haemoccult positive screening participants are invited for colonoscopy. CORSA includes genomic DNA and plasma of colorectal cancer cases, low-risk and high-risk adenomas, and colonoscopy-negative controls. Controls received a complete colonoscopy and were free of colorectal cancer or polyps. CORSA participants have been recruited in the four KRAGES hospitals in Burgenland, Austria, and additionally, at the Medical University of Vienna (Department of Surgery), the Viennese hospitals &#34;Rudolfstiftung&#34; and the &#34;Sozialmedizinisches Zentrum Sud&#34;, and at the Medical University of Graz (Department of Internal Medicine). 1403 colorectal cancer and advanced colorectal adenoma cases, and 1404 matched controls were selected for the study. Distribution of factors sex and age (5 year strata) were evenly matched between cases and controls. </p> <p><b>Cancer Prevention Study II (CPS II):</b><br/> The CPS II Nutrition cohort is a prospective study of cancer incidence and mortality in the United States, established in 1992 and described in detail elsewhere (Calle et al., 2002; Campbell et al., 2014) [PMID: 12015775; PMID: 25472679]. At enrollment, participants completed a mailed self-administered questionnaire including information on demographic, medical, diet, and lifestyle factors. Follow-up questionnaires to update exposure information and to ascertain newly diagnosed cancers were sent biennially starting in 1997. Reported cancers were verified through medical records, state cancer registry linkage, or death certificates. The Emory University Institutional Review Board approves all aspects of the CPS II Nutrition Cohort. A total of 360 cases and 359 controls were selected for this study. </p> <p><b>Czech Republic Colorectal Cancer Study (Czech Republic CCS):</b><br/> Cases with positive colonoscopy results for malignancy, confirmed by histology as colon or rectal carcinomas, were recruited between September 2003 and May 2012 in several oncological departments in the Czech Republic (Prague, Pilsen, Benesov, Brno, Liberec, Ples, Pribram, Usti and Labem, and Zlin). Two control groups, sampled at the same time of cases recruitment, were included in the study. The first group consisted of hospital-based individuals with a negative colonoscopy result for malignancy or idiopathic bowel diseases. The reasons for the colonoscopy were: i) positive fecal occult blood test, ii) hemorrhoids, iii) abdominal pain of unknown origin, and iv) macroscopic bleeding. The second control group consisted of healthy blood donor volunteers from a blood donor center in Prague. All individuals were subjected to standard examinations to verify the health status for blood donation and were cancer-free at the time of the sampling. Details of CRC cases and controls have been reported previously (Vymetalkova et al., 2014; Naccarati et al., 2016; Vymetalkova et al., 2016) [PMID: 24755277; PMID: 26735576; PMID: 27803053]. All subjects were informed and provided written consent to participate in the study. They approved the use of their biological samples for genetic analyses, according to the Declaration of Helsinki. The design of the study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Institute of Experimental Medicine, Prague, Czech Republic. All subjects included in the study were Caucasians and comprised 1792 cases and 1764 matched controls. Controls were matched to CRC cases as 1&#58;1 ratio. Matching was done on age and sex. Age was matched on &#43;&#45;5 years, whereas sex was matched exactly. For the cases without matched controls, matching was done only on sex. </p> <p><b>Early Detection Research Network (EDRN):</b><br/> The aim of the EDRN initiative is to develop and sustain a biorepository for support of translational research (Amin et al., 2010) [PMID: 21031013]. High-quality biospecimens were accrued and annotated with pertinent clinical, epidemiologic, molecular and genomic information. A user-friendly annotation tool and query tool was developed for this purpose. The various components of this annotation tool include: CDEs are developed from the College of American Pathologists (CAP) Cancer Checklists and North American Association of Central Cancer Registries (NAACR) standards. The CDEs provides semantic and syntactic interoperability of the data sets by describing them in the form of metadata or data descriptor. A total of 352 colorectal case samples and 399 controls were selected for this study. Controls were matched to CRC cases based on age and sex. </p> <p><b>The EPICOLON Consortium (EPICOLON):</b><br/> The EPICOLON Consortium comprises a prospective, multicentre and population-based epidemiology survey of the incidence and features of CRC in the Spanish population (Fernandez-Rozadilla et al., 2013) [PMID: 23350875]. Cases were selected as patients with de novo histologically confirmed diagnosis of colorectal adenocarcinoma. Patients with familial adenomatous polyposis, Lynch syndrome or inflammatory bowel disease-related CRC, and cases where patients or family refused to participate in the study were excluded. Hospital-based controls were recruited through the blood collection unit of each hospital, together with cases. All of the controls were confirmed to have no history of cancer or other neoplasm and no reported family history of CRC. Controls were randomly selected and matched with cases for hospital, sex and age (&#43;&#45; 5 years). A total of 370 cases and 370 controls were selected for genotyping. </p> <p><b>Hawaii Adenoma Study:</b><br/> For this adenoma study, two flexible-sigmoidoscopy screening clinics were first used to recruit participants on Oahu, Hawaii. Adenoma cases were identified either from the baseline examination at the Hawaii site of the Prostate Lung Colorectal and Ovarian cancer screening trial during 1996-2000 or at the Kaiser Permanente Hawaii&#39;s Gastroenterology Screening Clinic during 1995-2007. In addition, starting in 2002 and up to 2007, we also approached for recruitment all eligible patients who underwent a colonoscopy in the Kaiser Permanente Hawaii Gastroenterology Department. Cases were patients with histologically confirmed first-time adenoma(s) of the colorectum and were of Japanese, Caucasian or Hawaiian race&#47;ethnicity. Controls were selected among patients with a normal colorectum and were individually matched to the cases on age at exam, sex, race/ethnicity, screening date (&#43;&#45;3 months) and clinic and type of examination (colonoscopy or flexible sigmoidoscopy). We recruited 1016 adenoma cases (67.8% of all eligible) and 1355 controls (69.2% of all eligible); 889 cases and 1169 controls agreed to give a blood and 29 cases and 34 controls, a mouthwash sample. A total of 989 cases and 1185 controls were genotyped for this study. </p> <p><b>Columbus-area HNPCC Study (HNPCC, OSUMC):</b><br/> Patients with colorectal adenocarcinoma diagnosed at six participating hospitals were eligible for this study, regardless of age at diagnosis or family history of cancer. Patients with a clinical diagnosis of familial adenomatous polyposis were not eligible for this study. These six hospitals perform the vast majority of all operations for CRC in the Columbus metropolitan area (population 1.7 million). The institutional review board at all participating hospitals approved the research protocol and consent form in accordance with assurances filed with and approved by the United States Department of Health and Human Services. Briefly, during the period of January 1999 through August 2004, 1,566 eligible patients with CRC were accrued to the study (Hampel et al., 2008) [PMID 18809606]. A total of 1472 colorectal cancer samples had enough blood DNA remaining to be sent for genotyping. Control samples were provided by the Ohio State University Medical Center%#39;s (OSUMC) Human Genetics Sample Bank. The Columbus Area Controls Sample Bank is a collection of control samples for use in human genetics research that includes both donors&#39; anonymized biological specimens and linked phenotypic data. The data and samples are collected under the protocol &#34;Collection and Storage of Controls for Genetics Research Studies&#34;, which is approved by the Biomedical Sciences Institutional Review Board at OSUMC. Recruitment takes place in OSUMC primary care and internal medicine clinics. If individuals agree to participate, they provide written informed consent, complete a questionnaire that includes demographic, medical and family history information, and donate a blood sample. 4-7 ml of blood is drawn into each of 3 ACD Solution A tubes and is used for genomic DNA extraction and the establishment of an EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell culture, cell pellet in Trizol, and plasma. Controls were matched to CRC cases as 1&#58;1. Matching was done on age at reference time (age_ref), race, and sex. Age_ref was matched on &#43;&#45;5 years. Sex and race were matched exactly. For the cases without matched controls, matching was done only on sex and race with 1&#58;1 ratio. Since controls are fewer than cases, one control is matched on 2 cases at most. </p> <p><b>Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS):</b><br/> A parallel prospective study to the NHS (Nurses&#39; Health Study). The HPFS cohort comprised 51,529 men aged 40-75 who, in 1986, responded to a mailed questionnaire (Rimm et al., 1990) [PMID: 2090285]. Participants provided information on health related exposures, including current and past smoking history, age, weight, height, diet, physical activity, aspirin use, and family history of colorectal cancer. Colorectal cancer and other outcomes were reported by participants or next-of-kin and were followed up through review of the medical and pathology record by physicians. Overall, more than 97% of self-reported colorectal cancers were confirmed by medical record review. Information was abstracted on histology and primary location. Incident cases were defined as those occurring after the subject provided the blood sample. Prevalent cases were defined as those occurring after enrollment in the study but before the subject provided the blood sample. Follow-up evaluation has been excellent, with 94% of the men responding to date. Colorectal cancer cases were ascertained through January 1, 2008. In 1993-1995, 18,825 men in the HPFS mailed blood samples by overnight courier, which were aliquoted into buffy coat and stored in liquid nitrogen. In 2001-2004, 13,956 men in the HPFS who had not provided a blood sample previously mailed in a swish-and-spit sample of buccal cells. Incident cases were defined as those occurring after the subject provided a blood or buccal sample. Prevalent cases were defined as those occurring after enrollment in the study in 1986, but before the subject provided either a blood or buccal sample. After excluding participants with histories of cancer (except nonmelanoma skin cancer), ulcerative colitis, or familial polyposis, case-control sets were previously constructed. In addition to colorectal cancer cases and controls, a set of adenoma cases and matched controls with available DNA from buffy coat were selected for genotyping. Over the follow-up period, data were collected on endoscopic screening practices and, if individuals had been diagnosed with a polyp, the polyps were confirmed to be adenomatous by medical record review. Adenoma cases were ascertained through January 1, 2008. A separate case-control set was constructed of participants diagnosed with advanced adenoma matched to control participants who underwent a lower endoscopy in the same time period and did not have an adenoma. Advanced adenoma was defined as an adenoma 1 cm or larger in diameter and&#47;or with tubulovillous, villous, or highgrade dysplasia&#47;carcinoma-in-situ histology. Matching criteria included year of birth (within 1 year) and month&#47; year of blood sampling (within 6 months), the reason for their lower endoscopy (screening, family history, or symptoms), and the time period of any prior endoscopy (within 2 years). Controls matched to cases with a distal adenoma either had a negative sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy examination, and controls matched to cases with proximal adenoma all had a negative colonoscopy. In total, 159 advanced adenoma cases and 109 controls were selected for genotyping. </p> <p><b>Leeds Colorectal Cancer Study (LCCS):</b><br/> Following local ethical approval, colorectal cancer cases were recruited from 1997 until 2012 in Leeds, UK through surgical clinics. Initially, funding was provided by the UK Ministry of Agriculture, Farming and Fisheries (subsequently the Food Standards Agency) and Imperial Cancer Research Fund (subsequently Cancer Research UK). Recruitment also occurred similarly in Dundee, Perth and York between the periods of 1997 and 2001 using the same protocol and the data and samples were combined. Pathologically confirmed cases were consented at outpatient clinics, providing information on known and postulated risk factors for colorectal cancer (diet, lifestyle and family history) as well as providing a blood sample for DNA. Exclusion criteria included pre-existing diverticular disease and an inability to complete the questionnaire. The General Practitioners of cases (all UK residents have a nominated General Practitioner to whom to refer initial medical queries) and these GPs were asked to send letters to other persons on their patient list of the same gender and born within 5 years of the case. Subsequently to enhance the number of controls, we systematically invited patients from selected GP practices. Diet was assessed in cases and controls using an extensive dietary and lifestyle questionnaire modified by that produced by the European Prospective Investigation in Cancer (EPIC). The frequency that each specific food items were eaten was recorded and we also obtained average fruit and vegetable consumption as a cross-check. In total, 1591 cases and 739 controls provided a DNA sample. </p> <p><b>The North Carolina Colon Cancer Studies (NCCCS I/II):</b><br/> The North Carolina Colon Cancer Studies (NCCCS I- colon and NCCCS II-rectal) were population-based case-control studies conducted in 33 counties of North Carolina. Cases were identified using the rapid case ascertainment system of the North Carolina Central Cancer Registry. Patients with a first diagnosis of histologically confirmed invasive adenocarcinoma of the colon (cecum through sigmoid colon) between October 1996 and September 2000 were classified as potential cases in the NCCCS I. The NCCCS II included patients with a first diagnosis of histologically confirmed invasive adenocarcinoma of the sigmoid colon, rectosigmoid, or rectum (hereafter collectively referred to as rectal cancer) between May 2001 and September 2006. Additional eligibility requirements were: aged 40-80 years, residence in one of the 33 counties, ability to give informed consent and complete an interview, had a driver&#39;s license or identification card issued by the North Carolina Department of Motor Vehicles (if under the age of 65), and had no objections from the primary physician in regards to contacting the individual. Controls, identified and sampled during the respective study dates, were selected from two sources. Potential controls under the age of 65 were identified using the North Carolina Department of Motor Vehicles records. For those 65 years and older, records from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services were used. Controls were matched to cases using randomized recruitment strategies. Recruitment probabilities were done using strata of 5-year age, sex, and race groups. Dietary information was collected using a modified version of the semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire developed at the National Cancer Institute. In addition, participants were asked about vitamin and mineral supplementation, special diets, restaurant eating, sodium use, and fats used in cooking. In NCCCS I, 515 colorectal cases and 687 matched controls were sent for genotyping. In NCCCS II, 796 colorectal cases and 823 controls were sent from the NCCCS II for genotyping. Controls were matched to CRC cases as 1&#58;1 ratio. Matching was done on age, race, and sex. Age was matched on &#43;&#45;5 years. Race and sex was matched exactly. For the cases without matched controls, matching was done only on sex and race. </p> <p><b>Nurses Health Study (NHS):</b><br/> The NHS cohort began in 1976 when 121,700 married female registered nurses age 30-55 years returned the initial questionnaire that ascertained a variety of important health-related exposures (Belanger et al., 1978) [PMID: 248266]. Since 1976, follow-up questionnaires have been mailed every 2 years. Colorectal cancer and other outcomes were reported by participants or next-of-kin and followed up through review of the medical and pathology record by physicians. Overall, more than 97% of self-reported colorectal cancers were confirmed by medical-record review. Information was abstracted on histology and primary location. The rate of follow-up evaluation has been high: as a proportion of the total possible follow-up time, follow-up evaluation has been more than 92%. Colorectal cancer cases were ascertained through June 1, 2008. In 1989 -1990, 32,826 women in NHS I mailed blood samples by overnight courier, which were aliquoted into buffy coat and stored in liquid nitrogen. In 2001-2004, 29,684 women in NHS I who did not previously provide a blood sample mailed a swish-and-spit sample of buccal cells. Incident cases were defined as those occurring after the subject provided a blood or buccal sample. Prevalent cases were defined as those occurring after enrollment in the study in 1976 but before the subject provided either a blood or buccal sample. After excluding participants with histories of cancer (except nonmelanoma skin cancer), ulcerative colitis, or familial polyposis, case-control sets were previously constructed from which DNA was isolated from either buffy coat or buccal cells for genotyping. In addition to colorectal cancer cases and controls, a set of advanced adenoma cases and matched controls with available DNA from buffy coat were selected for genotyping. Over the follow-up period, data were collected on endoscopic screening practices and, if individuals had been diagnosed with a polyp, the polyps were confirmed to be adenomatous by medical record review. Adenoma cases were ascertained through June 1, 2011. A separate case-control set was constructed of participants diagnosed with advanced adenoma matched to control participants who underwent a lower endoscopy in the same time period and did not have an adenoma. Advanced adenoma was defined as an adenoma more than 1 cm in diameter and/or with tubulovillous, villous, or high-grade dysplasia/carcinoma-in-situ histology. Matching criteria included year of birth (within 1 year) and month/year of blood sampling (within 6 months), the reason for their lower endoscopy (screening, family history, or symptoms), and the time period of any prior endoscopy (within 2 years). Controls matched to cases with a distal adenoma either had a negative sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy examination, and controls matched to cases with proximal adenoma all had a negative colonoscopy. A total of 272 cases and 236 matched controls were sent to CIDR for the advanced adenoma case-control set. </p> <p><b>Northern Swedish Health and Disease Study (NSHDS):</b><br/> Comprises over 110,000 participants, including approximately one third with repeated sampling occasions, from three population-based cohorts (Dahlin et al., 2010; Myte et al., 2016) [PMID: 20197478; PMID: 27367522]. The largest is the ongoing Vasterbotten Intervention Programme, in which all residents of Vasterbotten County are invited to a health examination upon turning 30 (some years), 40, 50 and 60 years of age. Extensive measured and self-reported health and lifestyle data, as well as blood samples for central biobanking in Umea, Sweden, are collected at the health exam. Leucocyte DNA samples for 1&#58;1-matched CRC case-control sets from the NSHDS, of which 878 samples are included in this study, have been selected for genotyping. This is in addition to 354 samples from the NSHDS previously analyzed as part of the multicenter EPIC cohort. Cancer-specific and overall survival data are available for all patients. For at least 425 patients, archival tumor tissue has been analyzed for the BRAF V600E mutation and by sequencing codon 12 and 13 for KRAS mutations, as well as for MSI screening status by immunohistochemistry and for an eight-gene CIMP panel using quantitative real-time PCR (MethyLight). </p> <p><b>Ohio Colorectal Cancer Prevention Initiative (OCCPI, OSUMC):</b><br/> OCCPI (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01850654) is a population-based study of colorectal cancer patients diagnosed in one of 51 hospitals throughout the state of Ohio from January 1, 2013 through December 31, 2016. The OCCPI was created to decrease CRC incidence in Ohio by identifying patients with hereditary predisposition (statewide universal tumor screening for newly diagnosed CRC patients), increase colonoscopy compliance for first-degree relatives of CRC patients, and encourage future research through the creation of a biorepository. The 51 Ohio hospitals participating in the OCCPI were selected to represent a cross-section of clinical centers in the state based on high reported volume of CRC patients, affiliation with a high volume hospital, or interest in participation. Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval was obtained by the individual hospitals, Community Oncology Programs, or by ceding review to the OSU IRB. Written informed consent was obtained. A total of 2139 colorectal cases were genotyped. Patients were considered eligible for this study if they were age 18 or older at the time of enrollment, if they had a surgical resection (or biopsy if unresectable) in the state of Ohio demonstrating an adenocarcinoma of the colorectum from 1&#47;1&#47;13 - 12&#47;31&#47;16. Matched control samples were selected from the Ohio State University Medical Center&#39;s (OSUMC) Human Genetics Sample Bank in an identical way to the selection for the Columbus-area HNPCC Study (please refer to the description for the Columbus-area HNPCC Study). </p> <p><b>Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trail (PLCO):</b><br/> PLCO enrolled 154,934 participants (men and women, aged between 55 and 74 years) at ten centers into a large, randomized, two-arm trial to determine the effectiveness of screening to reduce cancer mortality. Sequential blood samples were collected from participants assigned to the screening arm. Participation was 93% at the baseline blood draw. In the observational (control) arm, buccal cells were collected via mail using the &#34;swish-and-spit&#34; protocol and participation rate was 65%. Details of this study have been previously described (Huang et al., 2016) [PMID&#58; 27673363] and are available online (http://dcp.cancer.gov/plco). For this study 1651 advanced adenoma cases and 1392 controls were selected for genotyping. </p> <p><b>Selenium and Vitamin E Prevention Trial (SELECT):</b><br/> The Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT) was a double-blind, placebo controlled clinical trial which explored using selenium and vitamin E alone and in combination to prevent prostate cancer in healthy men (Lippman et al., 2009) [PMID&#58; 19066370]. Secondary endpoints included the prevention of colorectal and lung cancers. SELECT was conducted at 427 sites and centers in the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico; 35,533 men 55 years and older (50 or older if African American) were randomized beginning August 22, 2001. Supplementation was discontinued on October 23, 2008 due to futility. 308 colorectal cancer cases and 308 matched controls were selected from the SELECT population and sent for genotyping. </p> <p><b>Screening Markers For Colorectal Disease Study and Colonoscopy and Health Study (SMS-REACH):</b><br/> Details on this study population were previously reported (Burnett-Hartman et al., 2014) [PMID&#58; 24875374]. Participants were enrollees in an integrated health-care delivery system in western Washington State (Group Health Cooperative, Seattle, Washington) aged 24-79 years who underwent an index colonoscopy for any indication between 1998 and 2007 and donated a buccal-cell or blood sample for genotyping analysis. Study recruitment took place in 2 phases, with phase 1 occurring in 1998-2003 and phase 2 occurring in 2004-2007. Persons who had undergone a colonoscopy less than 1 year prior to the index colonoscopy, persons with inadequate bowel preparation for the index colonoscopy, and persons with a prior or new diagnosis of colorectal cancer, a familial colorectal cancer syndrome (such as familial adenomatous polyposis), or another colorectal disease were ineligible. Patients diagnosed with adenomas or serrated polyps and persons who were polyp-free at the index colonoscopy (controls) were systematically recruited during both phases of recruitment. Approximately 75% agreed to participate and provided written informed consent. Based on medical records, persons who agreed to participate and those who refused study participation were similar with respect to age, sex, and colorectal polyp status. Study protocols were approved by the institutional review boards of the Group Health Cooperative and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (Seattle, Washington). A total of 575 cases and 508 matched were selected for the study. Controls were matched to CRC cases as 1&#58;1 ratio. Matching was done on age_ref, race, and sex. Age_ref was matched on &#43;&#45;5 years. </p> <p><b>The Women&#39;s Health Initiative (WHI):</b><br/> WHI is a long-term national health study that has focused on strategies for preventing heart disease, breast and colorectal cancer, and osteoporotic fractures in postmenopausal women. The original WHI study included 161,808 postmenopausal women enrolled between 1993 and 1998. The Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, WA serves as the WHI Clinical Coordinating Center for data collection, management, and analysis of the WHI. The WHI has two major parts&#58; a partial factorial randomized Clinical Trial (CT) and an Observational Study (OS); both were conducted at 40 Clinical Centers nationwide. The CT enrolled 68,132 postmenopausal women between the ages of 50-79 into trials testing three prevention strategies. If eligible, women could choose to enroll in one, two, or all three of the trial components. The components are: <b>Hormone Therapy Trials (HT):</b> This double-blind component examined the effects of combined hormones or estrogen alone on the prevention of coronary heart disease and osteoporotic fractures, and associated risk for breast cancer. Women participating in this component with an intact uterus were randomized to estrogen plus progestin (conjugated equine estrogens [CEE], 0.625 mg&#47;d plus medroxyprogesterone acetate [MPA] 2.5 mg&#47;d] or a matching placebo. Women with prior hysterectomy were randomized to CEE or placebo. Both trials were stopped early, in July 2002 and March 2004, respectively, based on adverse effects. All HT participants continued to be followed without intervention until close-out. <b>Dietary Modification Trial (DM):</b> The Dietary Modification component evaluated the effect of a low-fat and high fruit, vegetable and grain diet on the prevention of breast and colorectal cancers and coronary heart disease. Study participants were randomized to either their usual eating pattern or a low-fat dietary pattern. <b>Calcium/Vitamin D Trial (CaD):</b> This double-blind component began 1 to 2 years after a woman joined one or both of the other clinical trial components. It evaluated the effect of calcium and vitamin D supplementation on the prevention of osteoporotic fractures and colorectal cancer. Women in this component were randomized to calcium (1000 mg&#47;d) and vitamin D (400 IU&#47;d) supplements or a matching placebo. The <b>Observational Study (OS)</b>examines the relationship between lifestyle, environmental, medical and molecular risk factors and specific measures of health or disease outcomes. This component involves tracking the medical history and health habits of 93,676 women not participating in the CT. Recruitment for the observational study was completed in 1998 and participants were followed annually for 8 to 12 years. All centrally confirmed cases of invasive colorectal cancers, or deaths from colorectal cancer were selected as potential cases from September 30, 2015 database. Controls were participants free of colorectal cancer (invasive or in situ) as of September 30, 2015. Potential cases and controls were excluded if they (1) were non-White; (2) had history of colorectal cancers at baseline; (3) lost to follow-up after enrollment; (4) DbGAP ineligible; (5) had &#60;1.25ug of DNA; (6) selected for WHI study M26 Phase I or II; (7) selected for WHI study AS224 and also included in the imputation project. A total of 578 cases and 104,429 controls met the eligibility criteria. Each case was matched with 1 control (1&#58;1) that exactly met the following matching criteria: age (&#43;&#45;5 years), 40 randomization centers (exact), WHI date (&#43;&#45;3 years), CaD date (&#43;&#45;3 years), OS flag (exact), HRT assignments (exact), DM assignments (exact), and CaD assignments (exact). Control selection was done in a time-forward manner, selecting one control for each case from the risk set at the time of the case&#39;s event. The matching algorithm was allowed to select the closest match based on a criteria to minimize an overall distance measure (Bergstralh EJ, Kosanke JL. Computerized matching of cases to controls. Technical Report #56, Department of Health Sciences Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester MN. April 1995). Each matching factor was given the same weight. When exact matches could not be found, the matching criteria were gradually relaxed among unmatched cases and controls until all cases had found matched controls. Using the matching criteria specified above, 559 of the 578 eligible cases found exact matches. The matching criteria was then relaxed to &#58; Age&#43;&#45;5, randomization centers, WHI date &#43;&#45; 3 years, CaD date &#43;&#45; 3 years, OS flag, HRT flag, DM flag, CaD flag. 17 of the remaining 19 unmatched cases found matched controls. By matching on Age&#43;&#45;5, randomization centers, WHI date &#43;&#45; 3 years, CaD date &#43;&#45; 3 years, OS flag, HRT flag, the remaining 2 unmatched cases found their matches. </p>",

Instead, most somatic alterations involve structural alterations, which appear early during tumor progression. Molecular studies in mucosal melanoma generally only profile point mutations without interrogating copy number alterations, and pathogenic mutations are only found in 30% of cases.

    "description": "<p>The Gabriella Miller Kids First Pediatric Research Program (Kids First) is a trans-NIH effort initiated in response to the 2014 Gabriella Miller Kids First Research Act and supported by the NIH Common Fund. This program focuses on gene discovery in pediatric cancers and structural birth defects and the development of the Gabriella Miller Kids First Pediatric Data Resource (Kids First Data Resource). Both childhood cancers and structural birth defects are critical and costly conditions associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Elucidating the underlying genetic etiology of these diseases has the potential to profoundly improve preventative measures, diagnostics, and therapeutic interventions.</p> <p>Whole Genome Sequence (WGS) and phenotypic data from this study are accessible through dbGaP and <a href=\"https://kidsfirstdrc.org/\">kidsfirstdrc.org</a>, where other Kids First datasets can also be accessed. Disorders/Differences of Sex Development (DSD) are congenital conditions in which development of chromosomal, gonadal, or anatomic sex is atypical. DSD are chronic medical conditions collectively affecting &#126;1&#37; of the population, frequently requiring life-long care by multiple specialists, and carrying a significant public health burden. Some are associated with life-threatening events, such as adrenal crises in Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH). DSD are also associated with increased infertility, cancer, gender dysphoria risks, psychosocial distress and pervasive challenges to health-related quality of life (HRQoL) for patients and families. DSD are broadly classified into three categories: sex chromosome DSD, 46,XY DSD and 46,XX DSD, and further classified according to the type of gonad found in the patient (ovary, testis, ovotestis). </p> <p>We were able to increase significantly the diagnostic success for DSD using Whole Exome Sequencing (WES), with the identification of disease-causing and likely pathogenic variants in a third of a cohort of 46,XY patients. We have therefore proposed a shift in the diagnostic approach to DSD to use next-gen sequencing as a first-line clinical test, which could lead to faster and more accurate diagnosis, and orient further clinical management, limiting unnecessary, costly, and often invasive endocrine testing and imaging. However many remain unexplained (over half of the XY cases, a significant minority of XX cases, including most ovotesticular DSD, and most syndromic cases). In addition, the very large phenotypic variability in cases with known variants in the same gene is unexplained. </p> <p>We here propose to use Whole-Genome Sequencing (WGS), which dramatically improves upon exome sequencing, covering both coding and non-coding parts of the genome more uniformly, as an approach to not only improve diagnostic yield, but also to identify novel genes and regulatory elements involved in DSD.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Many tumors maintain chromosome ends through a telomerase-independent, homologous recombination based mechanism called alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT). While ALT occurs in only a subset of tumors, it is strongly associated with mutations in the genes encoding components of the histone H3.3 chaperone complex, ATRX and DAXX. To date the mechanistic role of ATRX and particularly DAXX mutations in potentiating ALT remains poorly understood. We identify an osteosarcoma cell line, G292, with a unique chromosomal translocation resulting in loss of DAXX function, while retaining functional ATRX. Using this distinctive resource, we demonstrate that introduction of wild type DAXX suppresses the ALT phenotype and restores localization of the ATRX/DAXX complex to PML bodies. This provides the first direct molecular evidence that ongoing DAXX deficiency is essential for maintenance of the ALT phenotype and highlights the potential for therapeutic targeting of this oncogenic pathway.</p>",

Heritable variants in genes associated with absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination may predict paclitaxel clinical outcome and toxicity. We designed a prospective multi-institutional study that recruited 546 patients receiving therapy with a 5-year follow up. All patients were genotyped using the Drug Metabolizing Enzymes and Transporters (DMET) platform, which ascertains 1931 genotypes in 235 genes.

To develop a precision medicine framework for mCRPC, we established a multi-institutional, international clinical sequencing infrastructure to enroll and carry out prospective whole exome and transcriptome sequencing of tumors from a cohort of mCRPC patients. We obtained high quality DNA and RNA sequence data from 150 bone or soft tissue biopsies. Central pathology revealed high-grade adenocarcinoma with only four cases (3.6%) showing neuroendocrine differentiation. Aberrations of AR, ETS genes, TP53 and PTEN were frequent (40-60% of cases), with TP53 and AR alterations being the most enriched in mCRPC compared to primary prostate cancer. We identified novel genomic alterations in PIK3CA/B (fusions and mutations); R-spondin, BRAF and RAF1 (fusions); APC (inactivating mutations); delta-catenin (missense mutations); and ZBTB16/PLZF (homozygous deletions). Aberrations of BRCA2, BRCA1 and ATM were observed at substantially higher frequencies (19.3% overall) than seen in primary prostate cancers, with 56% of these being exclusively somatic. Putative driver gene alterations were identified in nearly all patients, and over half also harbored driver gene fusions, homozygous deletions and/or amplifications. Moreover, 89% of patients harbored a clinically actionable aberration including 62.7% with aberrations in AR, 65% in other cancer-related genes, and 8% with actionable pathogenic germline alterations. Overall, integrative clinical sequencing analysis can be safely and efficiently performed in mCRPC, yields findings that may be actionable for enrolling patients in clinical trials of targeted therapies, and may inform the basis of individual clinical responses.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of colorectal cancer (CRC) have been instrumental in identifying a number of common susceptibility loci in Non Hispanic (NH)-White populations, and a NCI priority is to extend GWAS findings to other populations to address racial/ethnic disparities in cancer susceptibility. Currently, GWA studies of CRC in NH-Whites, Japanese and African-Americans are ongoing. We propose a complementary study to address this critical research area in Hispanics. Hispanics represent the fastest growing ethnic population in the U.S. and have been largely understudied in terms of genetic susceptibility to cancer. There are noted differences in incidence, survival and mortality in CRC by ethnic/racial groups. Hispanics often present with CRC at a younger age and have a significantly greater incidence of stage IV tumors or metastatic disease compared to NH-Whites. We propose to conduct a large, cost-efficient, population-based GWAS in Hispanics by building upon existing NIH-funded resources, the Colon Cancer Family Registry (Colon CFR) and the Multiethnic Cohort Study (MEC). We plan to recruit 2,500 Hispanic men and women diagnosed with CRC between 01/2008 to present using cancer registries in California, physican referrals and familial referrals. Risk factor/diet questionnaires, pathology reports, Oragene saliva samples (for genotyping), optional blood samples (for genotyping and biometric analysis) and tumor blocks (for MSI testing) will be collected using methodologies developed in the Colon CFR/MEC. Cases of CRC in the MEC (currently 473; anticipated 600 at end) will also be included. Population-based Hispanic individuals without a diagnosis of CRC participating in other GWA studies in the MEC (n=3,900, U01HG004726, Haiman) will be used as controls. We will genotype all 3,100 cases using the Illumina 1M array and use available genotype and epidemiologic data collected on 3,900 controls. Our statistical analyses will include: single-SNP and haplotype effects, gene-environment interactions and heterogeneity by MSI, tumor subtype and family history of CRC. We will replicate findings in a second-stage using CRC cases and controls from Mexico (1,000 cases and 1,000 controls, EU FP7 funding, CHIBCHA, Carvajal-Carmona/Tomlinson). We will also examine heterogeneity of the risk estimates by ethnicity/race by leveraging GWA data on NH-Whites (2,142 cases, 1,909 controls, U01 CA122839, Casey), (4,000 cases, 6,000 NH-White controls, UK-CHIBCHA, Tomlinson), Colombians (2,000 cases and 2,000 controls, CHIBCHA), Japanese (1,000 cases and 1,000 controls) and African-Americans (1,500 cases and 1,500 controls, R01CA126895, Le Marchand). We will genotype replicated significant SNPs in our main and combined analysis in several Hispanic populations (note: studies funded by EU or NIH for data collection but not GWAS), including 800 Puerto Ricans, 2,000 Brazilians, 2,000 Argentineans and 3,000 Spanish/Portuguese, to assess generalizability of findings. We will examine the differences in inflammatory gene transcription dynamics in leukocytes (from blood sample collection) by fatigue level (as assessed from study questionnaire data). This study will have a high impact by addressing the key question of racial/ethnic disparities related to genetic susceptibility to CRC, will provide translational guidelines on biological mechanisms during the cancer survivorship period to increase quality of life among cancer survivors, and will enable further growth and investment into research among Hispanics by providing a resource of genetic data and biospecimens, which is lacking.</p>",

    "description": "<p><b>Background:</b> Use of aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) has been shown to protect against tetraploidy, aneuploidy, and chromosomal alterations in the metaplastic condition Barrett&#39;s esophagus (BE) and to lower the incidence and mortality of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EA). The esophagus is exposed to both intrinsic and extrinsic mutagens resulting from gastric reflux, chronic inflammation and exposure to environmental carcinogens such as those found in cigarettes. Here we test the hypothesis that NSAID use inhibits accumulation of point mutations/indels during somatic genomic evolution in BE. <b>Methods:</b> Whole exome sequences were generated from 82 purified epithelial biopsies and paired blood samples from a cross-sectional study of 41 NSAID users and 41 nonusers matched by sex, age, smoking, and continuous time using or not using NSAIDs. <b>Results:</b> NSAID use reduced overall frequency of point mutations across the spectrum of mutation types, lowered the frequency of mutations even when adjusted for both <i>TP53</i> mutation and smoking status, and decreased the prevalence of clones with high variant allele frequency. Never smokers who consistently used NSAIDs had fewer point mutations in signature 17, which is commonly found in EA. NSAID users had on average a 50% reduction in functional gene mutations in nine cancer-associated pathways and also had less diversity in pathway mutational burden compared to nonusers. <b>Conclusions:</b> These results indicate NSAID use functions to limit overall mutations on which selection can act and supports a model in which specific mutant cell populations survive or expand better in the absence of NSAIDs.

    "history": "<p>The Seattle Barrett&#39;s Esophagus Study (SBES), which was founded in 1983 as a prospective observational cohort study of patients with Barrett&#39;s esophagus (BE), and now comprises more than 900 patients and includes a biorepository of biospecimens and associated clinical and epidemiologic data. BE is the only known precursor to esophageal adenocarcinoma (EA), which has an estimated annual incidence of 0.5% to 1.0%, yet BE is primarily an indolent disease that will not progress to cancer during the lifetime of most patients. Yet the incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma is known to be increasing at an alarming rate in many western countries, rising nearly 600% in the US over the three decades from 1972 - 2002. The overarching goals of the SBES are to (1) reduce morbidity and mortality of EA by early detection, prevention, or both and (2) elucidate mechanisms of human neoplastic progression in vivo that may be shared by other neoplasms whose early stages are less amenable to investigation. The study has over 30 years of experience in early translational research studies as defined by the NCI Translational Research Working Group (<a href=\"http://www.cancer.gov/trwg/TRWG-definition-and-TR-continuum\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.cancer.gov/trwg/TRWG-definition-and-TR-continuum</a>).</p> <p>BE can be modulated by host and environmental risk and protective factors as well as generation of variants, natural selection and neoplastic evolution of clones within the Barrett&#39;s segment. In the 1980&#39;s the study developed the endoscopic biopsy protocols that are the current standard of care for cancer risk stratification in BE. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, the study established the scientific base for studying somatic genomic evolution longitudinally. In the 2000&#39;s, the study used techniques derived from early studies in yeast to determine the order in which genetic abnormalities developed over space and time (\"clonal ordering\") during progression from BE to EA. The study showed that neoplastic evolution was branched with non-linear bifurcations that occurred in no obligate order (Barrett et al., Nat Gen 1999, PMID: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10319873\" target=\"_blank\">10319873</a>; Galipeau et al., JNCI 1999, PMID: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10601379\" target=\"_blank\">10601379</a>).</p> <p>The intersection between aspirin and somatic genomic evolution is a complex biological system in which NSAID use introduces selective pressures on the evolving somatic genome that decrease progression to cancer in some patients but not others. In the inflammatory environment of Barrett&#39;s esophagus, there is an interaction between gene mutations and NSAIDs that modulate pathways leading to genomic instability and progression to cancer. In a previous study (Vaughan et al., Lancet Oncol 2005, PMID: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16321762\" target=\"_blank\">16321762</a>), we showed that aspirin and other NSAIDs prevent cancer by reducing progression from early stages of BE to massive chromosomal instability manifested by tetraploidy and/or aneuploidy. This prospective study of 350 Seattle Barrett&#39;s Esophagus Study patients, followed for a median of 5.4 years found that the 5-year cumulative incidence of EA was 14.3% (95% CI 9.3-21.6) for never users compared to 6.6% (3.1-13.6) for current users (Hazard Ratio [HR] 0.20; 95% CI=0.10-0.41 compared to never users). This study also showed a decreased risk for progression to aneuploidy (HR=0.25; 95% CI 0.12-0.54 compared to never users) and tetraploidy (HR=0.44; 95% CI 0.22-0.87 compared to never users) in individuals with BE who were taking NSAIDs.</p> <p>A study by Galipeau et al., PLoS Med 2007, PMID: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17326708\" target=\"_blank\">17326708</a>, showed that NSAIDs also act on subset of high risk BE to prevent progression to EA even when high-risk somatic chromosomal alterations such as 9p LOH, 17p (p53) LOH, tetraploidy and/or aneuploidy have already developed. In this study, aspirin or other NSAID use resulted in a strong and significant reduction of risk of progressing to EA (p&lt;0.001). Interestingly, high risk individuals who were NSAID users and who had either two or all three chromosome instability markers at baseline showed the greatest reduction in risk of progressing to EA, with NSAID non-users having a 78% ten-year cumulative incidence of EA compared to only 28% for NSAID-users.</p> <p>A prospective observational cross-over study by Kostadinov et al., PLoS Genetics 2013, PMID: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23785299\" target=\"_blank\">23785299</a>, evaluated 161 biopsies from 13 individuals with BE who changed their NSAID use once (user to non-user or vice versa) over an average of 11.6 years of follow-up (range 6.4-19 years) using 1M SNP arrays at 5-8 time points. Across all individuals, there was a significant increase in the acquisition of new SCAs while off NSAIDs as compared to when they were on NSAIDs (60 &#177; 166 vs. 28 &#177; 48 per biopsy, p=0.013). There was also a significant increase in the number of pre-existing SCAs (detected at, or after, baseline) that were no longer detected while on NSAIDs as compared to while off NSAIDs (92 &#177; 143 vs. 19 &#177; 21 per biopsy, p&lt;0.01).</p> <p>These studies showed that aspirin and other NSAIDs decrease chromosomal instability, the most common type of genomic instability, at early and late stages of progression from BE to EA.</p>",

    "description": "<p>While the incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) has risen drastically in Western countries over the last 40 years, a similar trend has not been observed for EAC in China. Here we analyzed mutational spectrum, copy number alterations, and structural variants from whole-genome sequencing of ten Chinese EAC tumor samples and their matched normals, and compared them to EAC tumor specimens from Western countries previously reported. The mutational burden in Chinese EAC was significantly lower than that found in EAC from Western countries. The hallmark A&#62;C mutational signature observed at high frequency in EAC from Western countries, which linked to acid reflux, is completely absent in Chinese samples. Furthermore, none of Chinese samples showed evidence of chromothripsis and genome doubling that often found in EAC from Western countries. In summary, Chinese EAC tumor samples revealed distinct genomic profiles and signatures, suggesting that Chinese EAC may arise from a different etiological pathway.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Intratumoral genetic heterogeneity has been characterized across cancers by genome sequencing of bulk tumors, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). In order to more accurately identify subclones, define phylogenetic relationships, and probe genotype-phenotype relationships, we developed methods for targeted mutation detection in DNA and RNA isolated from thousands of single cells from five CLL samples. By clearly resolving phylogenic relationships, we uncovered mutated LCP1 and WNK1 as novel CLL drivers, supported by functional evidence demonstrating their impact on CLL pathways. Integrative analysis of somatic mutations with transcriptional states prompts the idea that convergent evolution generates phenotypically similar cells in distinct genetic branches, thus creating a cohesive expression profile in each CLL sample despite the presence of genetic heterogeneity. Our study highlights the potential for single-cell RNA-based targeted analysis to sensitively determine transcriptional and mutational profiles of individual cancer cells leading to increased understanding of driving events in malignancy.</p> <p>Reprinted from Genome Research, with permission from Publisher.</p>",

The RNA isolates were then analyzed using qRT-PCR for 23 genes selected following a literature search which include 19 genes sensitive to ischemia (FOS, HIF1A, DUSP1, EGR1, JUN, BTG2, SLC25A25, EPOR, MERTK, H3F3A, PRKACA, ZNF330, BARD1, EXOC7, MYH10, B2M, MDM4, KLF6, GUCY2C), and 4 house-keeping genes (SDHA, HMBS, POLR2A, GAPDH) potentially stable to ischemia. No genes evaluated could differentiate short ischemic times (1 to 3 hours). However, a combination of three unstable genes (PRKACA, FOS and H3F3A) normalized to a more stable gene (POLR2A) could generate a &#171;Cold Ischemia Score&#187; that could distinguish 1-3 hours cold ischemia from 12-hours cold ischemia with 62% sensitivity and 84% specificity. </p>",

We performed linked-read WGS on 23 mCRPC biopsy specimens and analyzed cell-free DNA sequencing data from 86 patients with mCRPC. In addition to frequent rearrangements affecting known prostate cancer genes, we observed complex rearrangements of the AR locus in most cases. These include highly recurrent tandem duplications involving an upstream enhancer of AR. A subset of cases also displayed a genome-wide tandem duplicator phenotype associated with CDK12 inactivation. Our findings highlight the complex genomic structure of mCRPC nominate new alterations that may inform prostate cancer treatment, and suggest that additional recurrent events in the noncoding mCRPC genome remain to be discovered. </p>",

Participants are all enrolled in the Field Cohort (FC); those who are seen at the NIH Clinical Center are then moved to the Clinical Center Cohort (CC). We added 90 new subjects since the last CR (from November 1, 2015, until September 30, 2016) for a total of 1987 subjects since 2002. The total reflects 101 accrued (1886 total individuals reported last year and 1987 this year) because we received consents on 11 people following the last CR report that were actually signed in the previous report period (prior to 11/1/2015). This includes those affected with each syndrome, as well as their relatives, and those seen at the Clinical Center, as well as those in the Field Cohort who are not seen at the Clinical Center. We have continued enrollment of new families, evaluation of selected participants at the NIH Clinical Center, and review of records from those seen at the NIH as well as the participants who remain in the Field Cohort. We have reinforced the fact that clinical phenotype and laboratory data are much more complete for those who came to the Clinical Center than for those whose information came solely from review of medical records. Seven new families visited the Clinical Center since the last review, for a total of 175 families. We identified the genotype and specific mutations in many of the families in our study, including 86% of those with Fanconi Anemia, 67% of those with dyskeratosis congenita, 52% of those with Diamond-Blackfan anemia, and 90% with Shwachman-Diamond Syndrome. Families in which we have not identified a gene include those in which all known genes have been tested, as well as more recent additions to the cohort. We provided genetic counseling to those for whom we planned and/or have genetic testing information. We continue to gather information on prevalent and incident cancers, and to search for new genes in families without mutations in known genes.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Goals of this ongoing study are to identify novel \"congenital cranial dysinnervation disorder\" (CCDD) genes and define the role of the wildtype and mutant genes in normal and aberrant development. The umbrella term (CCDD) refers to congenital birth defects with malformation of one or more cranial nerves, typically resulting in limitations of eye and/or face movement. Examples of CCDDs include congenital fibrosis of the extraocular muscles (CFEOM), congenital ptosis, Duane retraction syndrome (DRS), horizontal gaze palsy with progressive scoliosis (HGPPS), congenital 3rd, 4th or 6th nerve palsies, Moebius syndrome (MBS), and hereditary congenital facial paresis (HCFP). In some cases, anosmia, and disorders of hearing, sucking, chewing, swallowing, and breathing may also be classified as CCDDs. CCDDs can be accompanied by additional birth defects such as intellectual and social disabilities, developmental delays, limb anomalies, and cardiac, GI, and GU disorders. The genetic basis of multiple CCDDs has been determined, and the gene mutations typically alter cranial motor neuron identity or function, or perturb axon growth and guidance. Despite these successes, the genetic etiologies of many inherited CCDDs remain unidentified.<br></p>",
    "history": "<p>Recruitment of individuals affected by familial CFEOM was initiated in the late 1990s. The study was subsequently expanded to include individuals with other disorders based on cranial nerve and muscle dysfunction, as well as individuals with non-CCDD symptoms that have been observed in syndromic forms of the CCDDs.</p>",
    "inclusion_criteria": "<p>Individuals are included in the study if they were diagnosed with clinical features suggestive of congenital cranial nerve dysfunction, were appropriately consented and enrolled, donated a biological sample for DNA extraction of sufficient quality and quantity, and provided appropriate clinical data for phenotypic evaluation. Individuals with suspected acquired conditions were excluded.</p>",

    "inclusion_criteria": "<p><b>COLON, Colorectal Cancer: Longitudinal Observational study on Nutritional and lifestyle factors that influence colorectal tumor recurrence, survival and quality of life: </b>Patients with colorectal cancer from 11 hospitals were invited upon diagnosis. Patients with a history of colorectal cancer or (partial) bowel resection, chronic inflammatory bowel disease, hereditary colorectal cancer syndromes, or dementia were excluded from the study. At diagnosis and at several time points during follow-up, patients donated a blood sample and filled out questionnaires about diet and other lifestyle factors. Blood samples are stored in a biobank to facilitate future analyses. Information on vital status is retrieved by linkage with national registries. Information on clinical characteristics is gathered from linkage with the Netherlands Cancer Registry and with hospital databases. A total of 743 colorectal cancer samples were selected for genotyping. Matching controls were selected from the NQplus study described below.</p> <p><b>DACHS, Darmkrebs: Chancen der Verh&#252;tung durch Screening:</b> Cases with a first diagnosis of invasive colorectal cancer (International Classification of Diseases 10 codes C18-C20) who were at least 30 years of age (no upper age limit), German speaking, a resident in the study region, and mentally and physically able to participate in a one-hour interview, were recruited by their treating physicians either in the hospital a few days after surgery, or by mail after discharge from the hospital. Cases were confirmed based on histologic reports and hospital discharge letters following diagnosis of colorectal cancer. All hospitals treating colorectal cancer patients in the study region participated. Community-based controls were randomly selected from population registries, employing frequency matching with respect to age (5-year groups), sex, and county of residence. Controls with a history of colorectal cancer were excluded. Controls were contacted by mail and follow-up calls. In total 1268 cases and 634 matched controls were selected for genotyping.</p> <p><b>EPIC, European Prospective Investigation into Cancer:</b> In summary, 521,448 participants (~70% women) mostly aged 35 years or above were recruited between 1992 and 2000. Participants were recruited from 23 study centers in ten European countries. The current study included participants from France, Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, and United Kingdom (UK). Blood samples were collected at baseline according to standardized procedures, and stored at the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC; -196&#186;C, liquid nitrogen) for all countries except Sweden (-80&#186;C freezers). All study participants provided written informed consent. Ethical approval for the EPIC study was obtained from the review boards of IARC and local participating centers. Incident cancer cases were identified using population cancer registries in Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and the United Kingdom. In France, Germany and Greece cancer cases were identified during follow-up by a combination of methods including: health insurance records, cancer and pathology registries, and by active follow-up directly through study participants or through next-of-kin. Controls were selected from the full cohort of individuals who were alive and free of cancer (except non-melanoma skin cancer) at the time of diagnoses of the cases, using incidence density sampling and matched by: age (&#177;6 months at recruitment), sex, study center, follow-up time since blood collection, time of day at blood collection (&#177;4 hours), fasting status, menopausal status, and phase of menstrual cycle at blood collection. The current study selected 2,400 incident colorectal cancer cases, and 2,400 matched controls.</p> <p><b>HPFS, Health Professionals Follow-up Study:</b> In 1993-1995, 18,825 men in the HPFS mailed blood samples by overnight courier, which were aliquoted into buffy coat and stored in liquid nitrogen. In 2001-2004, 13,956 men in the HPFS who had not provided a blood sample previously, mailed in a swish-and-spit sample of buccal cells. Incident cases were defined as those occurring after the subject provided a blood or buccal sample. Prevalent cases were defined as those occurring after enrollment in the study in 1986, but before the subject provided either a blood or buccal sample. After excluding participants with histories of cancer (except non-melanoma skin cancer), ulcerative colitis, or familial polyposis, 2 case-control sets were constructed from which DNA was isolated from either buffy coat or buccal cells for genotyping, as follows: (1) a case-control set with cases of colorectal cancer matched to randomly selected controls who provided a blood sample and were free of colorectal cancer at the same time the colorectal cancer was diagnosed in the cases; and (2) a case-control set with cases of colorectal cancer matched to randomly selected controls who provided a buccal sample and were free of colorectal cancer at the same time the colorectal cancer was diagnosed in the case. For both case-control sets, matching criteria included year of birth (within 1 year) and month/year of blood or buccal cell sampling (within 6 months). Cases were pair-matched 1:1, 1:2, or 1:3 with a control participant(s). For this study, colorectal cancer cases were ascertained through January 1, 2010 and excluded cases included in the previous discovery GWAS of colorectal cancer [<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23266556\">PMID:23266556</a>]. If no control could be matched for a case using the initial stringent criteria, age criteria were relaxed to &#60;5 years to find an eligible control. A total of 237 CRC cases and 236 controls were selected for genotyping.</p> <p><b>NHS, Nurses&#39; Health Study:</b>In 1989-1990, 32,826 women in NHS I mailed blood samples by overnight courier, which were aliquoted into buffy coat and stored in liquid nitrogen. In 2001-2004, 29,684 women in NHS I who did not previously provide a blood sample mailed a swish-and-spit sample of buccal cells. Incident cases were defined as those occurring after the subject provided a blood or buccal sample. Prevalent cases were defined as those occurring after enrollment in the study in 1976 but before the subject provided either a blood or buccal sample. After excluding participants with histories of cancer (except non-melanoma skin cancer), ulcerative colitis, or familial polyposis, 2 case-control sets were constructed from which DNA was isolated from either buffy coat or buccal cells for genotyping: (1) a case-control set with cases of colorectal cancer matched to randomly selected controls who provided a blood sample and were free of colorectal cancer at the same time the colorectal cancer was diagnosed in the case; and (2) a case-control set with cases of colorectal cancer matched to randomly selected controls who provided a buccal sample and were free of colorectal cancer at the same time the colorectal cancer was diagnosed in the cases. For this study, colorectal cancer cases were ascertained through June 1, 2012 and excluded cases included in the previous discovery GWAS of colorectal cancer [<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23266556\">PMID:23266556</a>]. For both case-control sets, matching criteria included year of birth (within 1 year) and month/year of blood or buccal cell sampling (within 1 year). If no control could be matched for a case using the initial stringent criteria, age criteria were relaxed to &#60;5 years to find an eligible control. Cases were pair matched 1:1, 1:2, or 1:3 with a control participant(s). A total of 370 CRC cases and 370 controls were selected for genotyping.</p> <p><b>NQplus, Nutrition Questionnaires plus:</b> A total of 2,048 participants were recruited by inviting randomly selected inhabitants of the neighboring cities Wageningen, Ede, Renkum and Arnhem. In Veenendaal, another neighboring city, one individual of each household was invited to participate in the NQplus study. Baseline measurements consisted of a fasting venipuncture, dietary assessment, a physical examination, 24-h urine collection and general and lifestyle questionnaires. For this study, 179 persons without a blood sample, and those with a history of colorectal cancer, chronic inflammatory bowel disease or dementia were excluded. From the remaining 1,869 NQplus participants, controls were selected, whom were matched to the colorectal cancer cases of the COLON study by age and gender. A total of 737 control samples were selected for genotyping. </p>",

We have focused mainly on four types of lymphoid malignancies: chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), and Waldenstr&#246;m macroglobulinemia (WM). A few families with a rare lymphoma subtype, hairy cell leukemia (HCL) are included. In addition, single large pedigrees with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and juvenile myelomocytic leukemia (JMML) are included. Families are ascertained for having at least two patients with the same hematologic malignancy and are classified by the type of malignancy that predominates in the family. Multiple types of lymphoid malignancies are often found in the same family. Other data has shown that these conditions aggregate together in families. Verification of cancer diagnoses is obtained through medical records, pathology reports, and flow cytometry. Family members with precursor traits are also included, monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL) in CLL families and IgM monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) in WM families. </p>",

We also selected just over 10,000 SNPs from the meta-analyses in the non-European populations, with a majority of these SNPs coming from the analysis of overall prostate cancer in African ancestry populations as well as from the multiethnic meta-analysis. A substantial fraction of SNPs (~28,000) were also selected for fine-mapping of 53 loci not included in the common fine-mapping regions (tagging at r2>0.9 across &#177;500kb regions).

Abiraterone resistant tumors harbored alterations in AR and MYC, whereas patients treated with enzalutamide had acquired alterations in the cell cycle pathway.

    "description": "<p>In this study the investigators looked at adaptive reprogramming impact on the kinome when a MEK inhibitor called GSK1120212 (trametinib) was administered in a &#34;window of opportunity&#34; trial. GSK1120212 is not yet approved by the FDA for use in breast cancer patients. The investigators gave GSK1120212 for a short period of time (one week) to examine MEK and the other kinase expression in cancer cells both before and after the study drug is given. The investigators gave this drug for research purposes only. The length of time it was given is not intended to treat cancer.</p> <p>Recently researchers at UNC developed a process that can comprehensively profile the majority of the individual kinases in the kinome and examine the impact on kinase expression of kinase inhibitors (Duncan et al, Cell 2012, PMID: 22500798). This can tell us which kinases need to be concurrently blocked to augment responsiveness and prevent acquired resistance so that the investigators can design the best combinations of kinase blocking drugs for triple negative breast cancer. This is especially important for individuals with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) because there are no targeted drugs available that can block molecules that affect tumor growth. The investigators believe that kinase-blocking drugs have the potential to be a more effective treatment for people with TNBC.</p> <p>In this recently published study (Zawistowski et al, Cancer Discovery 2017, PMID: 28108460), TNBC patients treated with trametinib for 7 days resulted in a transcriptional response characterized by significant reprogramming of the tyrosine kinome, and this adaptive bypass response in human tumors was found to be similar to that seen in preclinical models including TNBC cell lines and mouse xenografts. In this study we also examined whether reprogramming differed between TNBC molecular subtypes, finding that basal-like and claudin-low human TNBC cells and mouse tumor subtypes had different adaptive transcriptional responses to MEK-ERK inhibition. Mechanistically we found that genome-wide enhancer remodeling drove the adaptive transcriptional response, suggesting that epigenetic approaches to reprogramming may be more durable than kinase inhibitor polypharmacology.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Desmoplastic melanoma (DM) is a rare subtype of melanoma characterized by dense fibrous stroma, resistance to chemotherapy and a lack of actionable driver mutations, but is highly associated with ultraviolet light DNA damage. We analysed 60 patients with advanced DM treated with programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) or PD-1 ligand (PD-L1) blocking antibody therapy. Objective tumor responses were observed in 42 of the 60 patients (70%, 95% confidence interval 57-81%), including 19 patients (32% overall) with a complete response. Whole-exome sequencing revealed a high mutational load and frequent NF-1 mutations (14 out of 17 cases). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis from 19 DM and 13 non-DM revealed a higher percentage of PD-L1 positive cells in the tumor parenchyma in DM (p = 0.04), highly associated with increased CD8 density and PD-L1 expression in the tumor invasive margin. Therefore, patients with advanced DM derive significant clinical benefit from PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint blockade therapy despite being a cancer defined by its dense desmoplastic fibrous stroma. The benefit is likely derived from the high mutational burden and a frequent pre-existing adaptive immune response limited by PD-L1 expression.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies are being used for detection of somatic mutations in tumors and studies of germline variation. However, most NGS studies used DNA isolated either from whole blood or fresh frozen tissue specimens. Meanwhile, the tissue specimens available from most National Cancer Institute (NCI) funded cohorts and the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) registries (<a href=\"http://seer.cancer.gov/biospecimen\">http://seer.cancer.gov/biospecimen</a>) are primarily formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE). There are limited data, on a small number of FFPE tissue samples, which suggest NGS is feasible. Much less is known about the feasibility of these technologies for large scale studies or using older FFPE specimens (e.g. 5-30 years old).</p> <p>The SEER cancer registries cover approximately 28% of the United States population, providing high quality demographic, clinical, pathologic, and survival data. The SEER Residual Tissue Repository (RTR) program was established in 2003. The RTR maintains biospecimens obtained from three of SEER&#39; population-based cancer registries: Iowa, Hawaii, and Los Angeles. Investigators at government, academic, and nonprofit institutions may apply to the program to obtain annotated FFPE tumor tissue specimens to study biomarkers, etiology, and other aspects with a population-based sample of cancer cases. </p> <p>The main objective of this project was to conduct a pilot study to determine whether the DNA obtained from archival FFPE tissue from 3 SEER Registries is of sufficient quality and quantity to conduct NGS. For Exome sequencing, sixty high-grade serous ovarian adenocarcinomas from FFPE tissues which were between 7 and 31 years old were obtained from three SEER registries. DNA was extracted, quantified, quality assessed, and subjected to whole exome sequencing. DNA extraction (yields and quality) and whole exome sequencing (depths of coverage and exome coverage obtained) results from this study will be presented. For RNA-sequencing, sixty-seven high-grade serous ovarian adenocarcinomas from FFPE tissues which were between 7 and 31 years old were obtained from three SEER registries. Total RNA was extracted, quantified, quality assessed, and subjected to whole transcriptome sequencing. Ultimately data derived from this analysis could serve as the basis for determining the utility of archival FFPE biospecimens for characterization and discovery projects utilizing NGS technologies instead of relying on frozen biospecimens. </p>",
    "history": "<p>The SEER registries are population-based and collect data on all cancer cases in their geographic areas. The types of information that may be available include: <ul> <li>demographic information</li> <li>tumor characteristics</li> <li>limited treatment data</li> <li>survival and cause of death</li> </ul> </p> <p> Thus, the SEER registries provide a unique opportunity for performing biospecimen studies on a representative sample of cancer cases from a particular geographic area. Recognizing this potential, the SEER Residual Tissue Repository (RTR) program was established in 2003.</p> <p> The RTR program aims to retain specimens associated with SEER patients that would otherwise be discarded. Investigators can use these specimens for research on prognostic biomarkers, etiology, and other hypotheses relevant to the population-based sample.</p> <p> Most RTR biospecimens are formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue blocks; however, some other biospecimens are maintained within the RTR. The RTR: <ul> <li>Enables studies on rare cancers by drawing from multiple registries to increase statistical power.</li> <li>Allows validation studies on specimens from population-based registries.</li> <li>Allows evaluation of bias within tumor collections since the SEER database provides information on all cancer cases in the registry catchment.</li> <li>Makes available the wealth of SEER data on each cancer.</li> <li>Allows analysis of trends in incidence, survival and treatment over the history and diversity of the SEER registries.</li> <li>Permits updating of survival data after a tissue microarray (TMA) is formed without violating privacy protections.</li> </ul> </p>",

The degree of heterogeneity was unprecedented, with &#126;1&#37; similarity between somatic alterations of the lung and lymph nodes. One novel translocation, PLAG1-ACTA2, present in both sites, up-regulated ACTA2 expression. ERBB2, the predominant driver oncogene, was amplified in both sites, more pronounced in the lung, and harbored an L869R mutation in the lymph node. Functional studies demonstrated increased proliferation, migration, metastasis, and resistance to ERBB2-directed therapy due to L869R mutation and increased migration due to ACTA2 overexpression. Within the lung, a nonfunctional CDK12, due to a novel G879V mutation, correlated with down-regulation of DNA damage response genes, causing genomic instability, and sensitivity to chemotherapy. We propose a model whereby a sub-clone metastasized early from the primary site and evolved independently in lymph nodes.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common tumor-predisposition disorder due to germline mutations in the tumor suppressor gene <i>NF1</i>. A virtually pathognomonic finding of NF1 is the plexiform neurofibroma (PN), a benign, likely congenital tumor that arises from biallelic inactivation of <i>NF1</i>. PN can undergo transformation to a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, an aggressive soft-tissue sarcoma. To better understand the non-<i>NF1</i> genetic contributions to PN pathogenesis, we performed whole-exome sequencing and genome-wide copy-number determination for 23 low-passage Schwann cell cultures established from surgical PN material with matching germline DNA. All resected tumors were derived from routine debulking surgeries. None of the tumors were considered at risk for malignant transformation at the time, <i>e.g.</i>, there was no pain or rapid growth. Deep (~500X) <i>NF1</i> exon sequencing was also conducted on tumor DNA. Non-<i>NF1</i> somatic mutation verification was performed using the Ampliseq/IonTorrent platform. We identified 100% of the germline <i>NF1</i> mutations and found somatic <i>NF1</i> inactivation in 74% of the PN. One individual with three PNs had different <i>NF1</i> somatic mutations in each tumor. The median number of somatic mutations per sample, including <i>NF1</i>, was one (range 0 - 8). <i>NF1</i> was the only gene that was recurrently somatically inactivated in multiple tumors. We found no recurrent non-<i>NF1</i> locus copy-number variation in PN. This is the first multi-sample whole-exome sequencing study of <i>NF1</i>-associated PN. Taken together with concurrent copy-number data, our comprehensive genetic analysis reveals the primacy of <i>NF1</i> loss as the driver of PN tumorigenesis.</p>",

    "description": "<p><b>Case-Control Study:</b><br/>Testicular germ cell cancer has been increasing among men during most of the 20th century. Despite this increase, the etiology of testicular cancer is poorly understood. To better understand the molecular epidemiology of testicular cancer, the National Cancer Institute and the Department of Defense are conducting a case-control study of testicular cancer among military servicemen. The project includes obtaining biosamples and questionnaire data from all participants. Pre-diagnostic serum samples are available from the approximately 1,000 cases and 1,000 controls enrolled in the study. </p> <p><b>Multiple-Case Family Study:</b><br/>In a parallel project, we are also studying families in which 2 or more testicular cancers have occurred. Among those men diagnosed with testicular cancer, about 1-3 percent report a family history of the disease (FTGCT). Brothers of affected individuals are 8 to 10 times more likely to develop testicular cancer, and men whose fathers had testicular cancer are four times more likely to develop testicular cancer, when compared with the relatives of men who have never had testicular cancer. Large-scale genetic linkage studies have failed to identify one or more rare, highly-penetrant testicular susceptibility genes. Rather, it appears that these familial clusters are due to the combined effects of multiple more common genes with low penetrance (so-called &#34;polygenic inheritance&#34;). Our cohort of FTGCT families was assembled to characterize this syndrome&#39;s clinical phenotype, and to discover the full range of cancer susceptibility loci that influence TGCT pathogenesis. </p>",
    "history": "<p>All individuals were genotyped on the Illumina 660K microarray SNP chip. Standard protocols for genotyping quality control (QC) were implemented. Individuals with missing rate &#62; 0.06 and/or autosomal heterozygosity 0.35 (N=61) and SNPs with missing rate &#62;0.1 and/or Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium p-value &#60;1x10<sup>-7</sup> were excluded. No individuals with cryptic relatedness (IBD &#62;45%) or unexpected duplicate were detected. Genotype concordance rate from 41 expected duplicates was &#62;99.9%.</p>",
    "inclusion_criteria": "<p><b>Case-Control Study:</b><br/> The study was designed as a pair-matched, case-control study, although additional controls were initially identified because of the transient nature of the military population. By use of the computerized Defense Medical Surveillance System database, all available controls were identified for each potential case participant. From the list of possible controls, four individuals who matched each case on age (within 1 year), race (White, Black, other), and date of available serum sample (within 30 days) were chosen at random as the control set. The first man on the list was designated as the primary control. Every attempt was made to enroll this man for 30 days (average number of attempted contacts = 90). The effort included tracing attempts, multiple letters, and telephone calls. If the man could not be traced, was deployed to a combat zone, was deceased, refused to participate, or could not be contacted within a 30-day period, attempts were begun to enroll the next possible control in the set. </p> <p>The database linkage identified 961 cases who appeared to meet the study criteria. Further review found that 76 men could not be traced, 27 had died, three were known to be deployed to a combat zone, and two were found ineligible, leaving 853 possible participants. Of these men, 22 were in the process of being contacted when the study closed. Thus, of the 831 men contacted, 754 agreed to participate, resulting in a participation rate of 91 percent. In the instances where the potential case was deceased, the study attempted to obtain proxy information from the man&#39;s mother. Thirteen proxy questionnaires were completed by the mothers of the 27 deceased men. Among the controls, 2,579 were evaluated for inclusion. Of these men, 385 men could not be traced, 18 had died, 64 were known to be deployed to a combat zone, and two were found to be ineligible. In addition, 928 could not be contacted within 30 days. Of the remaining 1,182 men, 32 were in the process of being contacted when the study closed. Thus, of the 1,150 men contacted, 928 agreed to participate, resulting in a participation rate of 81 percent. Among the 754 cases and 928 controls, there were 720 matched case-control pairs.</p> <p><b>Multiple-Case Family Study:</b><br/>Familial testicular cancer kindred were identified through mailings to the members of health care provider societies who were likely to encounter TGCT patients in the course of their practice, a study-specific website, and various TGCT patient support/family advocacy groups. Criteria for enrollment into the study include at least one of the following: 1) &#8805;two men in the family had testicular cancer, 2) one family member has bilateral testicular cancer (that is, independent cancers involving both testicles), or 3) one family member with testicular cancer is a member of a set of genetically identical brothers, such as twins or triplets. We have recruited 733 members from 151 multiple-case families, and collected 649 DNA samples for our genetic analyses. Willing families were brought to the NIH Clinical Center for a 2-day, in-person evaluation by our multidisciplinary team. We collected demographic, family history, cancer risk factor and behavioral/psychosocial data, performed TGCT-related imaging studies and collected a variety of biological specimens. Family members who were unable or unwilling to travel to NIH completed study questionnaires and contributed biological specimens in their home communities. We attempted to objectively verify every cancer reported among bloodline family members. </p>",

    "description": "<p>The distal esophagus is an important anatomical area where gastric acid reflux can cause reflux esophagitis (RE), Barrett&#39;s esophagus (BE) (intestinal metaplasia), and esophageal adenocarcinoma (EA). The incidence of EA has increased 6-fold in the U.S. since the 1970s, parallel to a significant increase in the prevalence of gastroesophageal reflux diseases (GERD). Although specific host factors might predispose one to disease risk, such a rapid increase in incidence must be predominantly environmental. The cause remains unknown. Our hypothesis is that changes in the foregut microbiome are associated with EA and its precursors, RE and BE in the GERD sequence.</p> <p>We will conduct a case control study to characterize the microbiome in every stage of the GERD sequence as well as analyze the trend in changes in the microbiome along disease progression toward EA.</p> <p>Specific Aim 1. To conduct a comprehensive population survey of the foregut microbiome and demonstrate its association with GERD sequence, by a 16S rRNA gene survey. We will analyze samples of the foregut microbiome at three anatomic loci: mouth, distal esophagus, and gastric corpus. Changes of the microbiota in the distal esophagus will be correlated with the phenotypes. Spatial relationship between the esophageal microbiota and upstream (mouth) and downstream (stomach) foregut microbiotas as well as temporal stability of the microbiome-disease association will also be examined.</p> <p>Specific Aim 2. To define distal esophageal metagenome and demonstrate its association with GERD sequence, by shotgun metagenomic analysis. We will first classify samples of the metagenome into metagenotypes by between-sample k-mer distance and correlate the metagenotypes with the four phenotypes. Subsequent detailed analyses will include pathway-disease and gene-disease associations. DNA viruses and fungi, if identified, also will be correlated with the phenotypes.</p> <p>A significant association between the foregut microbiome composition and GERD sequence, if demonstrated, will be the first step for eventually testing the causal hypothesis that an abnormal microbiome is required for the development of the sequence of phenotypic changes toward EA. If EA and its precursors represent a microbial ecological disease, treating the cause of GERD might become possible, for example, by normalizing the microbiome through use of antibiotics, probiotics, or prebiotics. Causative therapy for GERD could prevent its progression and reverse the current trend of increasing incidence of EA.</p>",
    "history": "<p>Gastroesophageal reflux disorders (GERD) refer to a sequence of diseases arising from gastric reflux, including reflux esophagitis (RE), Barrett&#39;s esophagus (intestinal metaplasia) (BE), and its downstream sequelum esophageal adenocarcinoma (EA). The incidence of EA has increased &gt; 6-fold in the U.S. since the 1970s (1), parallel to an increasing prevalence of RE (2). Despite numerous studies, no explanation has been found for the increase. Although prevalence of RE is increasing in both men and women, strong gender disparity with male predominance is obvious at the stages of BE and EA for reasons unknown (3-5). The current strategy for dealing with the continuum of progression of GERD-related problems is limited to passive observation and symptomatic treatment, such as using proton pump inhibitors, and has been ineffective in preventing the increase in the incidence of EA. GERD, similar to other chronic diseases, likely has a multi-factorial etiology. Although host factors likely play a role, such a rapid increase in incidence must be predominantly environmental. Conventional studies have identified numerous risk factors, but their association with GERD is moderate. The main factor(s) remain to be identified. The role of the microbiome in the development of inflammation-related cancers has been suggested by recent studies in some mouse models that mimic inflammatory bowel diseases (6). The development of mucosal inflammation and adenocarcinoma requires both a trigger (chemical or genetic) and the presence of commensal bacteria. Although human exposure to several exogenous pathogens has been monitored, there has been little attention paid to changes in the indigenous microbiome. This is partly due to the complexity and difficulties in culture and analysis of the human microbiome.</p> <p>Among the environmental agents that have been considered are microbes. The human body can be viewed as a superorganism composed of an amalgam of both microbial and <i>Homo sapiens</i> cells. Our relationship with bacteria can be considered to span a broad spectrum, from mutualism to pathogenicity (7). There are currently two theories to explain bacterial diseases. The classic pathogen theory, largely attributed to Koch, requires the presence of specific pathogens, such as <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> or <i>Bacillus anthracis</i> (8). Alternatively, the microecological disease or \"pathogenic microbial community\" theory is a new concept in which the entire community contributes to pathogenicity although no individual community members can be categorized as classic pathogens (9).</p> <p>Non-pathogenic bacteria do not have classically defined virulence factors but may harm the host by their basic metabolic activities or structural components. The gut microbiota in ob/ob mice, for example, has an increased capacity to harvest energy from the diet and might play a role in the pathophysiology of obesity (10). Also, a structural component of the gram-negative outer membrane from non-pathogenic bacteria, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), can induce abnormal relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter via activation of the iNOS pathway (11) and delay gastric emptying through the COX-2 pathway. Both effects increase the chance of reflux (12).</p> <p>We have endeavored to understand the bacterial-host relationship in GERD in a stepwise way. First, we performed a comprehensive study of the microbiota in the distal esophagus and demonstrated its complexity, despite little prior knowledge (13-14). Surprisingly, the esophageal microbiota is comparable in complexity to those found in the mouth, stomach, colon, vagina, and skin. Collectively, nine phyla were observed, represented by 166 species. The distal esophagus could harbor &gt; 200 species, as predicted by the Chao-1 richness estimator. Second, we have demonstrated that in a high-risk population (elderly males) the esophageal microbiota can be classified into two types with the use of both unsupervised and phenotype-directed analyses, and that the type II biota is the strongest (OR &gt; 15) amongst all known environmental factors that are associated with the pathological changes related to RE and BE (15).</p>",
    "inclusion_criteria": "<p><b>Inclusion Criteria:</b><br/> Subjects will be screened by questionnaire with or without heartburn symptom, endoscopic examination, histological examination, and 48-hour pH monitoring. A subject will be considered for enrollment into this study if the results of his/her screening examinations are diagnostic for one of the following four phenotypes: </p> <p> <ol> <li><i>Normal control:</i> Normal control will be selected from subjects who present to the GI Clinics. The normal control should meet all of the following four criteria: 1) no reflux symptoms, such as heart burn; 2) normal endoscopic findings; 3) histopathological examination shows no inflammatory infiltrate or less than 10 lymphocytes per high power field (HPF, 400x magnification) in the squamous epithelium; 4) normal pH range (the fraction time of pH &lt; 4 and DeMeester score &lt; 14.72) with 48-hour pH monitoring test. Besides the classic normal phenotype, there are two variants. <b>Perinormal:</b> subjects meet all the normal control criteria but pathological examination was not performed because gastroenterologists decided there was no indication to take biopsies based on the EGD findings. <b>Treated Normal:</b> Subjects meet all the normal control criteria but are have been treated recently with PPI or antacid.</li> <li><i>Reflux esophagitis (RE):</i> Subjects should meet all of the following four criteria: 1) reflux symptoms, such as heart burn; 2) endoscopic esophagitis, classified to Grade A, B, C, and D according Los Angeles Classification of reflux esophagitis; 3) histopathological esophagitis, characterized by basal zone hyperplasia exceeding 20% of the epithelial thickness, papillae extending into the superficial third of the epithelium, and presence of lymphocytes equal to or more than 10 cells/HPF or any numbers of eosinophils or polymorphonuclear leukocytes; 4) evidence of gastric reflux, determined by 48-hour pH monitoring test, abnormal Brovo pH monitoring with the fraction time of pH &gt; 4% and DeMeester score &gt; 14.72. Besides the classic reflux esophagitis phenotype, there are two variants. <b>Partial esophagitis:</b> these patients have reflux symptoms and abnormal pH test results but either EGD or pathology but not both shows evidence of esophagitis. <b>No-esophagitis (NERD):</b> these patients have reflux symptoms and abnormal pH test results but both EGD and pathology show no evidence of esophagitis.</li> <li><i>Barrett&#39;s esophagus (BE):</i> esophageal squamous epithelium replaced by intestinal-type epithelial cells and goblet cells.

    "description": "<p>DNA Inverted Repeats as an At-risk Motif for Palindromic Gene Amplification defines oncogene amplification that is configured as a series of inverted duplications (palindromic gene amplification). To study the impact of palindromic gene amplification in cancer genomes, we developed an approach to enrich DNA palindromes from genomic DNA (Genome-wide Analysis of Palindrome Formation, GAPF-seq). This dbGaP site lists the files of GAPF-seq of tumor DNA and plasma DNA from cancer patients. This site also lists other genomic data, such as shallow whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data. WGS data were used to examine the association of DNA palindromes, detected by GAPF-seq, and genomic amplification, detected by WGS.</p><p> </p> <p>In the initial study, we show that the ERBB2 oncogene at 17q12 is susceptible to palindromic gene amplification in HER2-positive breast tumors. We investigated eight tumors in this study, of which five tumors were HER2-positive, and three tumors were HER2-negative. HER2 status was determined by clinical FISH tests. We applied three genomic approaches to investigate the amplification mechanism: (1) copy number analysis by array-CGH on the Affymetrix SNP6.0 platform (8 files), (2) sequencing of DNA libraries enriched with tumor-derived palindromic DNA (Genome-wide Analysis of Palindrome Formation, GAPF-seq) (8 files) and (3) unbiased whole-genome sequencing (WGS) (1 file). These molecular data are made available in the dbGaP. </p> <p>Genomic studies using tumor DNA were approved under the Internal Institutional Review Board at the Cleveland Clinic (IRB07-136: EXEMPT: Chromosome Breakage and DNA Palindrome Formation). Specimens were obtained and methods were carried out under the auspices of IRB 7881 (Evaluation of Genetic and Molecular Markers in Patients with Breast Cancer). All patients consented to allow their cancer specimens to be used by researchers in an anonymized fashion. The consent form indicates that publication will take place without identifiers to protect the identity of any specific individual.</p> <p>We observed significant enrichment of palindromic DNA within amplified ERBB2 genomic segments in four out of five HER2-positive tumors. None of the three HER2-negative tumors showed such enrichment. Palindromic DNA was particularly enriched at amplification peaks and boundaries between amplified and normal copy-number regions. Thus, palindromic gene amplification shaped the amplified ERBB2 locus. The moderate enrichment of palindromic DNA throughout the amplified segments leads us to propose that the ERBB2 locus is amplified through a mechanism that repeatedly generates palindromic DNA, such as Breakage-Fusion-Bridge cycles. Our results reveal a potential interaction between local genomic environments and gene amplification mechanisms. This study is published under the title \"Palindromic amplification of the ERBB2 oncogene in primary HER2-positive breast tumors\" <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=28211519\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-family: sans-serif;\">(PMID:28211519)</a>. In a follow-up, cell-based molecular and cytogenetic study, we defined a nearby genomic block that is fragile and initiates palindromic amplification of ERBB2 (PMID: 33290559).</p><p>We expanded the sequencing of DNA libraries enriched with tumor-derived palindromic DNA (Genome-wide Analysis of Palindrome Formation, GAPF-seq) for other breast cancer subtypes, ER-positive and triple-negative breast tumors. In addition to the GAPF-seq data from tumor DNA, we also examine DNA palindromes in cancer patients' plasma DNA in an effort to evaluate GAPF-seq as a sensitive cancer detection test of liquid biopsy.

Although these immune checkpoint blockades (CTLA-4 blockade and PD-1 blockade) have shown durable response, response rate is modest.

The other four funded GAME-ON projects were: the ColoRectal TransdisciplinaryStudy (CORECT), Elucidating Loci Involved in Prostate Cancer Susceptibility (ELLIPSE), Follow-up of Ovarian Cancer Genetic Association and Interaction Study (FOCI), and Transdisciplinary Research in Cancer of the Lung (TRICL).</p> <p>To identify additional cancer risk loci, improve the precision of fine-mapping, and facilitate cross-cancer analyses, the GAME-ON projects and other consortia formed the OncoArray network (<a href=\"http://epi.grants.cancer.gov/oncoarray/\">http://epi.grants.cancer.gov/oncoarray/</a>), which developed and genotyped a new custom genotyping array (the \"OncoArray\") in large numbers of cancer cases and controls (over 400,000 samples). The OncoArray is a custom array manufactured by Illumina. The array includes a backbone of approximately 260,000 SNPs that provide genome-wide coverage of most common variants, together with markers of interest for each of the five GAME-ON cancers identified through genome-wide association studies (GWAS), fine-mapping of known susceptibility regions, sequencing studies, and other approaches. The array also includes loci of interest identified through studies of other cancer types, and other loci of interest to multiple cancer types (including loci associated with cancer related phenotypes, drug metabolism and radiation response). Additionally, SNPs relating to quantitative phenotypes such as body mass index (BMI), height, and breast density that correlate with common cancer risks are also included.</p> <p>The DRIVE data included under this dbGAP submission include OncoArray data from 60,015 breast cancer cases and controls genotyped at the Center for Inherited Disease Research (CIDR), University of Cambridge, National Cancer Institute, University of Copenhagen, University of Southern California and Mayo Clinic. Details on an additional approx. 80,000 breast cancer cases and controls genotyped at other centers can be found at <a href=\"http://bcac.ccge.medschl.cam.ac.uk/bcacdata/oncoarray/\">http://bcac.ccge.medschl.cam.ac.uk/bcacdata/oncoarray/</a>. </p>",

    "description": "<p>Recently developed methods that utilize partitioning of long genomic DNA fragments, and barcoding of shorter fragments derived from them, have succeeded in retaining long-range information in short sequencing reads. These so-called read cloud approaches represent a powerful, accurate, and cost-effective alternative to single-molecule long-read sequencing. We developed software, GROC-SVs, that takes advantage of read clouds for structural variant detection and assembly. We apply the method to two 10x Genomics data sets, one chromothriptic sarcoma with several spatially separated samples, and one breast cancer cell line, all Illumina-sequenced to high coverage. Comparison to short-fragment data from the same samples, and validation by mate-pair data from a subset of the sarcoma samples, demonstrate substantial improvement in specificity of breakpoint detection compared to short-fragment sequencing, at comparable sensitivity, and vice versa. The embedded long-range information also facilitates sequence assembly of a large fraction of the breakpoints; importantly, consecutive breakpoints that are closer than the average length of the input DNA molecules can be assembled together and their order and arrangement reconstructed, with some events exhibiting remarkable complexity. These features facilitated an analysis of the structural evolution of the sarcoma. In the chromothripsis, rearrangements occurred before copy number amplifications, and using the phylogenetic tree built from point mutation data, we show that single nucleotide variants and structural variants are not correlated. We predict significant future advances in structural variant science using 10x data analyzed with GROC-SVs and other read cloud-specific methods.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a frequent B-cell malignancy characterized by recurrent somatic chromosome alterations and a low level of point mutations. Here we present single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarray analyses of a single CLL patient over 29-years of observation and treatment, and transcriptome and whole genome sequencing at selected timepoints. We identified chromosome alterations of 13q14-, 6q- and 12q+ in early cell clones, elimination of clonal populations following therapy, and subsequent appearance of a clone containing trisomy 12 and a chromosome 10 copy neutral loss of heterogeneity (LOH) that marks a major population dominant at death. Serial single cell RNA sequencing revealed elevated mRNA expression of the FOS, JUN and KLF4 genes just before the appearance of acute disease requiring therapy. This gene expression pattern became undetectable following therapy, but reoccurred following relapse. Transcriptome evolution indicates that complex expression changes occur over time. In conclusion, CLL can evolve gradually during indolent phases, and undergo rapid changes following therapy. </p>",

GAME-ON&#39;s overall goal was to foster an intra-disciplinary and collaborative approach to the translation of promising research leads deriving from the initial wave of cancer GWAS. Specific goals included replication of previous GWAS findings and identification of new susceptibility loci through meta analyses of existing GWAS data and fine mapping of identified loci to better pinpoint causal variants; and identify germline variants that are associated with risk of multiple cancers. The other four funded GAME-ON projects were: the ColoRectal TransdisciplinaryStudy (CORECT), Elucidating Loci Involved in Prostate Cancer Susceptibility (ELLIPSE), Follow-up of Ovarian Cancer Genetic Association and Interaction Study (FOCI), and Transdisciplinary Research in Cancer of the Lung (TRICL).</p> <p>To identify additional cancer risk loci, improve the precision of fine-mapping, and facilitate cross-cancer analyses, DRIVE investigators performed a meta-analysis of eleven genome-wide association studies of breast cancer: The Australian Breast Cancer Family Study (ABCFS), the British Breast Cancer Study (BBCS), the Breast and Prostate Cancer Cohort Consortium (BPC3), the Breast Cancer Family Registries (BCFR), the Dutch Familial Bilateral Breast Cancer Study (DFBBCS), German Consortium for Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer (GC-HBOC), the Helsinki breast cancer family Study (HEBCS), the Mammary Carcinoma Risk factor Investigation (MARIE), the Singapore and Sweden Breast Cancer Study (SASBAC), the Triple Negative Breast Cancer Study (TNBC), and the UK2 GWAS. These studies comprised a total of 16,062 cases and 46,157 controls. Imputation to the 1,000 Genomes Project Phase 1 v3 ALL reference panel was performed by study, and summary statistics from each study were combined using fixed-effect meta analysis. </p>",

    "description": "<p>This genome-wide association study was funded by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) to identify uncommon susceptibility loci for prostate cancer. A total of 4,600 prostate cancer cases and 2,840 controls of European ancestry from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial were genotyped using the Illumina HumanOmni2.5 and passed rigorous quality control filters. Additional genotype data (available in dbGap under other accession numbers) from 101 independent controls of European ancestry scanned with the HumanOmni2.5 were also included, resulting in a total of 4,600 cases and 2,941 controls for the published analysis. SNPs from the most promising regions, as determined by rank p-value, under multiple different models as well as select candidate genes were taken forward for replication using a custom Iselect chip in 6,575 cases and 6,392 controls of European ancestry. Results from the primary scan after imputation were then meta-analyzed with the Iselect results as well as results from previous GWAS.</p> <p>In a combined meta-analysis of the primary scan together with the custom Iselect replication and a previous GWAS, thirteen loci reached genome-wide significance (P &#60; 5 x 10<sup>-8</sup>) for prostate cancer overall; however, each of them confirmed a previously reported locus. Although they did not reach genome-wide significance, we found evidence for two new suggestive loci at chromosome 16q22.2 (PKD1L3, rs12597458, P = 9.67 x 10<sup>-8</sup>) and 6p22.3 (CDKAL1, rs12198220, P = 2.13 x 10<sup>-7</sup>). In a combined case-only analysis of 12,518 prostate cancer cases, we identified two loci associated with Gleason score, a pathological measure of disease aggressiveness: rs35148638 at 5q14.3 (RASA1, P=6.49x10<sup>-9</sup>) and rs78943174 at 3q26.31 (NAALADL2, P=4.18x10<sup>-8</sup>). In a stratified case-control analysis, the SNP at 5q14.3 appears specific for aggressive prostate cancer (P=8.85x10<sup>-5</sup>) with no association for non-aggressive prostate cancer compared to controls (P=0.57).</p> <p>Only the cases and controls genotyped on the HumanOmni2.5 specifically for this study are included under this accession number. Controls (n=101) genotyped with the HumanOmni2.5 for another study are posted under a different accession number.

This study sought to discover potential clinical manifestations of major pathways in squamous cell lung cancer, particularly the PI3K pathway.

    "description": "<p>Our study addressed a specific question in NCI RFA-CA-12-022: \"What underlying causal events - e.g., genetic, epigenetic, biologic, behavioral, or environmental - allow certain individuals to survive beyond the expected limits of otherwise highly lethal cancers?\". A germline mutation in BRCA1 (BRCA1+) is the most penetrant genetic predisposition for breast cancer. Nevertheless, a portion of BRCA1+ carriers does not develop breast cancer in their lifetime, suggesting that the genetic predisposition can be antagonized by resistant factors. BRCA1+ was inherited from an ancestor of the carrier family thousand years ago. We hypothesize that evolution could select certain genetic components to suppress oncogenesis caused by the predisposition. We compared germline variants in all genes in 27 pairs of breast cancer-unaffected and -affected BRCA1+ carriers, each pair inherited the same BRCA1+. We identified 12 deleterious variants enriched in breast cancer-unaffected carriers, all are common variants. A variant rs3735400 is located in ANLN, a cytokinesis-essential gene. Overexpression of variant-containing ANLN and suppressed expression of endogenous ANLN decrease ANLN nuclear localization and delay cell growth. Our findings suggest that common variants can be selected to resist oncogenesis imposed by BRCA1+.</p>",

Identification of genes or other genomic variants that increase the susceptibility to PCa would impact public health by providing valuable biological data related to the development of PCa. PCa gene discoveries could additionally lead to novel treatment of PCa and provide a valuable additional screening tool for identification of men at increased risk for PCa. Men diagnosed with PCa at an early age are much more likely to die of the disease than men diagnosed later in life, and it has been shown that early-onset (EO) PCa is more likely due to genetic risk factors than later-onset disease. This study was designed to be a powerful and unprecedented opportunity to identify genetic susceptibility variants that are associated with EO PCa using well characterized samples from two investigative teams that have a long history of collaboration in PCa research. </p>",

However, persistent AR signaling undermines therapeutic efficacy and promotes progression to lethal castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), even when patients are treated with potent second-generation AR-targeted therapies abiraterone and enzalutamide. Here we define diverse AR genomic structural rearrangements (AR-GSRs) as a class of molecular alterations occurring in one third of CRPC-stage tumors. AR-GSRs occur in the context of copy-neutral and amplified AR and display heterogeneity in breakpoint location, rearrangement class, and sub-clonal enrichment in tumors within and between patients. Despite this heterogeneity, one common outcome in tumors with high sub-clonal enrichment of AR-GSRs is outlier expression of diverse AR variant species lacking the ligand binding domain and possessing ligand-independent transcriptional activity. Collectively, these findings reveal AR-GSRs as important drivers of persistent AR signaling in CRPC.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Endometrial cancer, the most common gynecological malignancy in the United States, has both an environmental and genetic component. To this end, we conducted a genome-wide association study to identify genes involved in endometrial cancer using studies from the NCI-supported Epidemiology of Endometrial Cancer Consortium (E2C2). For the discovery stage we included samples from 6 cohort and 7 case control studies through 2007. The total number of cases genotyped were 2,307, white women of European descent, and 2,307 matched controls using the Illumina HumanOmniExpress platform. We conducted the replication using the Infinium HumanExome BeadChip, which successfully genotyped 177,139 variants in 1055 cases and 1778 controls from four ethnically diverse studies that are part of the Epidemiology of Endometrial Cancer Consortium (E2C2). The overall goal is to determine whether certain genotypes are predictive of future endometrial cancer risk, and whether the genotypes interact with established endometrial risk factors.</p>",

    "report_name": "The African American Breast Cancer Epidemiology and Risk (AMBER) Consortium Study",
    "description": "<p>The AMBER Consortium Study was formed to pool interview data, questionnaire data, and biological samples from epidemiological studies of breast cancer in African-American women to discover the potential causes of early-onset and aggressive breast cancer in African-American women. AMBER is funded through a Program Project grant from the National Cancer Institute. Genetic data submitted to dbGaP come from participants in the Carolina Breast Cancer Study, Women&#39;s Circle of Health Study, and Black Women&#39;s Health Study. The P01 consists of four scientific projects; the aims include follow-up on previous GWAS findings for breast cancer susceptibility in AA women as well as investigation of SNPs in candidate genes in biologically plausible pathways. These SNPs were genotyped using DNA from 3130 African-American women with breast cancer and 3700 controls. Descriptions of the original studies that provided the data and samples for this collaborative study are given below.</p> <p> <ol> <li><u>The Carolina Breast Cancer Study (CBCS):</u> a North Carolina population-based case-control study of breast cancer, conducted in three phases. The current study phase, phase 3 (years 2008-2014), includes women residents in 44 counties. CBCS phases 1 and 2 were conducted in 24 counties. Breast cancer cases are identified using Rapid Case Ascertainment in cooperation with the NC Central Cancer Registry. Controls were identified for phases 1 and 2 only (1993-1996 and 1996-2001), using Division of Motor Vehicles lists for women under age 65 and Health Care Financing Administration lists for women 65 and older. Randomized recruitment was used to oversample AA women and women under age 50. In-depth interviews are conducted by study nurses in participants&#39; homes to obtain information on potential risk factors for breast cancer. DNA samples have been obtained from most participants. Overall response rates for Phases 1 and 2 were 74% for AA cases and 54% for AA controls. Phase 3, conducted in 44 counties from 2008-2014, includes cases only. The response rate for AA cases in Phase 3 was 70.5%.</li> <li><u>The Women&#39;s Circle of Health Study (WCHS):</u> a multi-site case-control study in New York City (NYC) and New Jersey (NJ) aimed at evaluating risk factors for early and aggressive breast cancer in women of AA and EA ancestry. Recruitment in NYC took place between January 2002 and December 2008 and involved hospital-based ascertainment of cases, while controls were identified through random digit dialing (RDD). Recruitment at the NJ site started in March 2006 and is ongoing. Phase I of the study ended in April 2012 and covered seven counties in NJ. WCHS2 includes two additional counties. Cases in NJ were identified from 2006 to 2012 by the NJ State Cancer Registry using rapid case ascertainment. Controls were initially recruited though RDD (2006 to 2010) and later through community-based efforts (2009-2012). In-person interviews ascertained data on established and suspected risk factors for breast cancer. DNA samples were obtained. Among eligible AA women, 75% in NY and 54% in NJ completed an interview and provided a biologic specimen.</li> <li><u>Black Women&#39;s Health Study (BWHS):</u> an ongoing prospective cohort study of health and illness among U.S. black women, with a focus on cancer. The study began in 1995 when 59,000 AA women 21-69 years of age from across the United States completed a 14-page postal health questionnaire. The median age at entry was 38, and participants were residents of 17 states in mainland U.S.: Northeast, 28%; South, 30%; Midwest, 23%; West, 19%. The baseline questionnaire elicited information on a wide range of variables, including demographic factors, use of medical care, family history of breast cancer, reproductive and medical history, cigarette and alcohol use, weight, height, waist and hip circumference, medication use, diet, and exercise. Biennial follow-up questionnaires ascertain new cases of breast cancer and other illnesses and update covariate information. Medical record and cancer registry data are sought for all participants who report a diagnosis of breast cancer. As of 2014, approximately 80% of the baseline cohort have completed follow-up. DNA samples were obtained from about 50% of participants. BWHS data for the AMBER consortium were prepared as a nested case-control study, with controls frequency-matched to cases on year of birth, geographic region, and most recent questionnaire completed prior to the end of the at-risk period. </li> </ol> </p>",

    "description": "<p>Although multi-agent combination chemotherapy is curative in a significant fraction of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients, 20% of cases relapse and most die due to chemo-refractory disease. Here we used whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing to analyze the mutational landscape and pattern of clonal evolution at relapse in pediatric ALL cases. These analyses showed that ALL relapses originate from a common ancestral precursor clone of the diagnosis and relapsed populations and frequently harbor mutations implicated in chemotherapy resistance. RAS-MAPK pathway activating mutations in NRAS, KRAS and PTPN11 were present in 24/55 (44%) cases in our series. Notably, while some cases showed emergence of RAS mutant clones at relapse, in others, RAS mutant clones present at diagnosis were replaced by RAS wild type populations. Mechanistically, functional dissection of mouse and human wild type Kras and mutant Kras (Kras G12D) isogenic leukemia cells demonstrated induction of methotrexate resistance, but also improved response to vincristine, in mutant Kras- expressing lymphoblasts. These results identify chemotherapy driven selection as a central mechanism of leukemia clonal evolution and pave the road for the development of tailored personalized therapies for the treatment of relapsed ALL. </p>",

The goal of the study was to identify common genetic variants associated with the risk of NHL. As described previously (Berndt SI et al., Nature Genetics, 2013, PMID: <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23770605\">23770605</a> ), cases and controls from 22 studies, including nine prospective cohort studies, eight population-based case-control studies, and five clinic or hospital-based case-control studies were included in this effort. Cases of NHL were ascertained from cancer registries, clinics or hospitals, or through self-report verified by medical and pathology reports. The phenotype information for all NHL cases was reviewed centrally at the InterLymph Data Coordinating Center and harmonized according to the hierarchical classification proposed by the InterLymph Pathology Working Group based on the World Health Organization (WHO) classification (2008). Controls were frequency matched to cases on age and gender by study, and the study was limited to subjects of European ancestry.

Summary level phenotypes for the NCI Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma GWAS study participants can be viewed at the top-level study page <a href=\"study.cgi?study_id=phs000801\">phs000801</a> NCI Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma GWAS.</p> <p>Marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) encompasses a group of lymphomas that originate from marginal zone B-cells present in extranodal tissue and lymph nodes and account for 7-12% of all non-Hodgkin&#39;s lymphoma (NHL) cases. Very little is known about genetic susceptibility to MZL. To identify genetic susceptibility loci for MZL, we genotyped 825 cases of MZL and 2,685 controls of European ancestry from 22 studies using the Illumina Omni Express. Additional genotype data (available in dbGap under other accession numbers) from 3,536 independent controls of European ancestry scanned with the Omni2.5 were also included, resulting in a total of 825 cases and 6,221 controls for analysis. The data was imputed using the 1000 Genomes reference panel, and SNPs from the most promising regions, as determined by rank p-value, were taken forward for replication in 456 cases and 906 controls. In the combined meta-analysis of 1,281 cases and 7,127 controls, we identified two independent SNPs in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region that reached the threshold of genome-wide statistical significance (P&#60;5 x10<sup>-8</sup>). These were rs9461741 in the butyrophilin-like 2 (MHC class II associated) (BTNL2) gene at 6p21.32 in HLA class II (P=3.95 x10<sup>-15</sup>, OR=2.66, CI=2.08<sup>-3.39</sup>); and rs2922994 at 6p21.33 in HLA class I (P=2.43 x10<sup>-9</sup>, OR=1.64, CI=1.39-1.92).</p> <p>Controls for this study and other NHL sub-types are posted to dbGaP as a sub-study of the NHL GWAS. Only the 825 MZL cases genotyped with the OmniExpress for this study are included under this accession number.</p>",
    "history": "<p>Genetic factors have long been implicated in the etiology of NHL through both family-based studies and case-control studies. A pooled analysis within the Interlymph Consortium showed that individuals with a first-degree relative with NHL, Hodgkin lymphoma, and leukemia had an increased risk of NHL, but the risks differed by subtype. In an effort to identify genes associated with NHL, a candidate gene and candidate SNP approach has been applied in multiple studies of NHL in the US, Canada, Europe, and Australia. These studies have also suggested that the risks associated with genetic variants vary by subtype. Recent GWAS efforts for NHL subtypes, such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and follicular lymphoma, have identified highly significant associations with SNPs in new regions, underscoring the validity and potential utility of the GWAS approach. In this regard, it is expected that there are additional common susceptibility alleles, which could contribute to specific NHL subtypes and the complex etiology of NHL.</p>",

To identify additional susceptibility loci for FL, we genotyped 2,142 cases of FL and 2,685 controls of European ancestry from 22 studies using the Illumina Omni Express. Additional genotype data (available in dbGap under other accession numbers) from 3,536 independent controls of European ancestry scanned with the Omni2.5 were also included, resulting in a total of 2,142 cases and 6,221 controls for analysis. The data was imputed using the 1000 Genomes reference panel and the results from the log-additive genetic model were then meta-analyzed with the results from two other GWAS of FL for a combined total of 2,728 cases and 7,758 controls of European ancestry. SNPs from the most promising regions, as determined by rank p-value, were taken forward for replication in 1,795 cases and 5,586 controls. Five loci outside of the HLA region were associated with FL risk: 11q23.3 (rs4938573, P= 5.79x10<sup>-20</sup>) near CXCR5; 11q24.3 (rs4937362, P=6.76x10<sup>-11</sup>) near ETS1; 3q28 (rs6444305, P= 1.10x10<sup>-10</sup>) in LPP; 18q21.33 (rs17749561, P=8.28x10<sup>-10</sup>) near BCL2; and 8q24.21 (rs13254990, P= 1.06x10<sup>-8</sup>) near PVT1. In an analysis of the HLA region, we identified four linked HLA-DR&#946;1 multi-allelic amino acids at positions 11, 13, 28 and 30 that were associated with FL risk (P-values = 4.20 x10<sup>-67</sup> to 2.67x10<sup>-70</sup>). Additional independent signals included rs17203612 in HLA class II [odds ratio (OR =1.44; P= 4.59x10<sup>-16</sup>] and rs3130437 in HLA class I (OR=1.23; P= 8.23x10<sup>-9</sup>).</p> <p>Controls for this study and other NHL sub-types are posted to dbGaP as a sub-study of the NHL GWAS.

In the combined analysis, five independent SNPs in four loci achieved genome-wide significance marked by rs116446171 at 6p25.3 (EXOC2; P=2.33x10<sup>-21</sup>), rs2523607 at 6p21.33 (HLA-B; 2.40x10<sup>-10</sup>), rs79480871 at 2p23.3 (NCOA1; P=4.23x10<sup>-8</sup>), and two independent SNPs, rs13255292 and rs4733601, at 8q24.21 (PVT1; P=9.98x10<sup>-13</sup> and P=3.63x10<sup>-11</sup>, respectively).</p> <p>Controls for this study and other NHL sub-types are posted to dbGaP as a sub-study of the NHL GWAS. Only the 2,661 DLBCL cases genotyped with the OmniExpress for this study are included under this accession number.</p>",
    "history": "<p>Genetic factors have long been implicated in the etiology of NHL through both family-based studies and case-control studies. A pooled analysis within the Interlymph Consortium showed that individuals with a first-degree relative with NHL, Hodgkin lymphoma, and leukemia had an increased risk of NHL, but the risks differed by subtype. In an effort to identify genes associated with NHL, a candidate gene and candidate SNP approach has been applied in multiple studies of NHL in the US, Canada, Europe, and Australia. These studies have also suggested that the risks associated with genetic variants vary by subtype. Recent GWAS efforts for NHL subtypes, such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and follicular lymphoma, have identified highly significant associations with SNPs in new regions, underscoring the validity and potential utility of the GWAS approach. In this regard, it is expected that there are additional common susceptibility alleles, which could contribute to specific NHL subtypes and the complex etiology of NHL.</p>",

The goal of the study was to identify common genetic variants associated with the risk of NHL.

Cases of NHL were ascertained from cancer registries, clinics or hospitals, or through self-report verified by medical and pathology reports. Controls were frequency matched to cases on age and gender by study, and the study was limited to subjects of European ancestry. Participants were genotyped using the Illumina Omni Express.

    "description": "<p>Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a highly heterogeneous disease, for which prognosis has been relegated to clinic-pathologic staging for decades. There is a need to molecularly stratify subpopulations of CRC to better predict outcome and assign therapies. Here we report targeted exome sequencing of 1,321 cancer-related genes on 468 tumor specimens, which identified a subset of 17 genes that best classify CRC, with APC (Gene ID: 324) playing a central role in predicting overall survival. APC may assume 0, 1, or 2 truncating mutations, each with a striking differential impact on survival. Tumors lacking any APC mutation carry a worse prognosis than single APC mutation tumors, but tumors with two APC mutations and KRAS (Gene ID: 3845) and TP53 (Gene ID: 7157) mutations confer the poorest survival among all the subgroups examined. Our study demonstrates a substantial prognostic role for APC and suggests that sequencing of APC may have clinical utility in the routine staging and potential therapeutic assignment for CRC.</p>",

    "description": "<p>High throughput RNA Sequencing has revealed that the human genome is widely transcribed. However, the extent of natural antisense transcription, the molecular mechanisms by which natural antisense transcripts (NATs) might affect their cognate sense genes, and the role of NATs in cancer are less well understood. Here, we use strand-specific paired-end RNA sequencing (ssRNASeq) on a cohort of 376 cancer patients covering 9 tissue types to comprehensively characterize the landscape of antisense expression. Our results reveal that greater than 60% of annotated transcripts have measureable antisense expression and the expression of sense and antisense transcript pairs is in general positively correlated. Furthermore, by studying the expression of sense/antisense pairs across tissues we identify lineage-specific, ubiquitous and cancer-specific antisense loci. Our results raise the possibility that NATs participate in the regulation of well-known tumor suppressors and oncogenes. Finally, this study provides a catalogue of cancer related genes with significant antisense transcription (oncoNAT). This resource will allow researchers to investigate the molecular mechanisms of sense/antisense regulation and further advance our understanding of their role in cancer.</p>",

Included in this study are samples obtained from a primary tumor, first relapse, second relapse and several intermediate timepoints. We identified somatic mutations present in each tumor by analysis of whole genome (WGS) and exome sequence data. Single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and small insertions and deletions were identified in both the exome and WGS data. Large copy number variations (CNVs) and structural variants (SVs) were identified in the WGS data. A custom capture reagent was designed to target most variants and used to generate deep validation sequence data. The expression status of all somatic variants was assessed by RNA-seq. The RNA-seq data was also used for gene expression analysis and gene fusion detection.</p>",

We performed a genomic analysis of 230 PLGGs of which 73 had whole genome/RNA sequencing performed and show that MYB-QKI fusions define the seizure associated tumor, Angiocentric Glioma (AG). MYB-QKI fusions present in AGs contribute to tumorigenesis through three mechanisms: MYB activation by truncation, enhancer translocation driving aberrant MYB-QKI expression, and hemizygous loss of QKI, a tumor suppressor gene. Such interplay between three oncogenic mechanisms has diagnostic and therapeutic implications in AGs, and illustrates the functional complexity associated with rearrangements in cancer. </p>",

    "description": "<p>Despite the potential of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to improve patient diagnosis and care, the empirical value of WGS in the cancer genetics clinic is unknown. We performed WGS on members of two cohorts of cancer genetics patients: those with BRCA1/2 mutations (n = 176) and those without (n = 82). Initial analysis of potentially pathogenic variants (PPVs, defined as nonsynonymous variants with allele frequency &#60; 1% in ESP6500) in 163 clinically-relevant genes suggested that WGS will provide useful clinical results. This is despite the fact that a majority of PPVs were novel missense variants likely to be classified as variants of unknown significance (VUS). Furthermore, previously reported pathogenic missense variants did not always associate with their predicted diseases in our patients. This suggests that the clinical use of WGS will require large-scale efforts to consolidate WGS and patient data to improve accuracy of interpretation of rare variants. While loss-of-function (LoF) variants represented only a small fraction of PPVs, WGS identified additional cancer risk LoF PPVs in patients with known BRCA1/2 mutations and led to cancer risk diagnoses in 21% of non-BRCA cancer genetics patients after expanding our analysis to 3209 ClinVar genes. These data illustrate how WGS can be used to improve our ability to discover patients&#39; cancer genetic risks. \"Reprinted from doi:10.1016/j.ebiom.2014.12.003, with permission from EBioMedicine.\"</p>",

    "description": "<p>Sezary syndrome is a leukemic and aggressive form of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) resulting from the malignant transformation of skin-homing central memory CD4+ T cells. To identify new genetic alterations involved in Sezary syndrome and CTCL transformation we performed whole-exome sequencing of tumor-normal sample pairs from 26 Sezary syndrome and 16 CTCL patients. These analyses revealed a distinctive pattern of somatic copy number alterations in Sezary syndrome including highly prevalent recurrent chromosomal deletions involving the TP53, RB1, PTEN, DNMT3A, and CDKN1B tumor suppressor genes. Mutation analysis identified a broad spectrum of somatic mutations involving key genes involved in epigenetic regulation (TET2, CREBBP, MLL3, BRD9, SMARCA4 and CHD3) and signaling, including mutations in MAPK1, BRAF, CARD11 and PRKG1 driving increased MAPK, NFKB and NFAT activity upon T-cell receptor stimulation. Collectively, our findings provide new insights into the genetics of Sezary syndrome and CTCL and support the development of personalized therapies targeting key oncogenically activated signaling pathways for the treatment of these diseases.</p>",

    "report_name": "New England-Based Case-Control Study of Ovarian Cancer",
    "description": "<p>The case-control data provided to dbGaP were collected under NCI grant number CA54419 which had 3 enrollment phases: I (1992-1997), II (1998-2002) and III (2003-2008). Altogether, CA54419 funded 15 years of data and specimen collection, resulting in one of the longest running population based case-control studies of ovarian cancer. The study goal was to examine reproductive factors, lifestyle exposures, and genetic background in relation to ovarian cancer risk. The project recruited cases from Eastern Massachusetts and New Hampshire, and became known as the New England-based Case-Control study (NECC) of ovarian cancer. </p> <p>3957 ovarian cancer cases diagnosed at ages 18-80 and residing in Eastern Massachusetts and New Hampshire were identified through tumor boards and registries. Of these, 3083 (78%) were eligible and among those eligible, 2203 (71%) were enrolled. After excluding 127 non-epithelial and 35 mixed mesodermal tumors, 2041 cases with epithelial tumors of ovarian, primary peritoneal, and fallopian tube origin, including borderline malignancies were included. On average, cases were interviewed 10 months after their diagnosis. A pathologist reviewed pathology reports and recorded histologic subtype, grade, and stage. Mixed ovarian cancers described as predominantly one type were classified as that type. Undifferentiated, transitional cell tumors, or mixed serous/transitional cell tumors were counted as serous. Other mixed epithelial, malignant Brenner, and unspecified epithelial tumors were classified as other. </p> <p>2100 controls were identified through random digit dialing (RDD), driver-license lists, and town-resident lists. During the first funding phase from 1992 to 1997, 420 (72%) controls identified through RDD and 102 (51%) through town-resident lists agreed to participate. From 1998 to 2008, only town-resident lists were used to identify potential controls. 4366 controls were identified, of whom 1426 (33%) were ineligible if they had died, moved, or were seriously ill or if they did not have a working telephone, speak English, or have at least one ovary. Of eligible controls, 1362 (46%) declined to participate by phone or via &#39;opt-out&#39; postcard and 1578 (54%) were enrolled. Controls were frequency matched to cases by 5-year age groups and region of residence.</p> <p>In all phases, after written informed consent, demographic information, reproductive and medical history, and habits were assessed by in-person or telephone interview (in a few instances). All of the questions were framed with respect to a reference date defined as 1 year before the diagnosis date for women in the case group and the date of interview for those in the control group. This study was approved by institutional review boards at Dana Farber Harvard Cancer Center and Dartmouth Medical Center.</p>",
    "history": "<p>Between 1978 and 1981, Dr. Daniel Cramer supervised a case-control study of ovarian cancer as part of his Doctoral Thesis in Cancer Epidemiology. Dr. George Hutchinson was Dr. Cramer&#39;s thesis advisor and principal investigator (PI) of the case-control study of ovarian cancer. This study involved cases recruited from major teaching hospitals in greater Boston and controls selected from Town Lists of registered voters who were matched on age and residence precinct to the cases. A novel finding from this study was that use of talc powders in the genital area increases risk for ovarian cancer. The study also confirmed a lower risk associated with oral contraceptive use. With Dr. Cramer being the PI, a second Boston-based case-control study of ovarian cancer, similar to the first one, was performed between 1984 and 1987. This study confirmed the talc association, this time with much greater detail on the exposure, identified dairy product use to be a potential factor increasing risk, and suggested that psychotropic drug use might be linked to ovarian cancer risk. Because of limited exposure data, a narrow population base, and absence of stored DNA, data from these two studies are not being supplied to dbGaP. In 1992, with Dr. Cramer being the PI, the catchment area was enlarged to include all of Eastern Massachusetts and the entire state of New Hampshire using both hospital tumor boards and the Massachusetts and New Hampshire Cancer Registries. The New Hampshire component of the study was directed initially by Dr. Robert Greenberg and later by Dr. Linda Titus. The study was renewed in 1998 and again in 2003, and became one of the largest and longest running case-control studies of ovarian cancer sponsored by the National Cancer Institute. We believe that an attractive component of this study is the detailed data on demographic, anthropomorphic, lifestyle, and reproductive factors, from more than 2000 cases of epithelial ovarian cancer as well as extensive information on germ line genetic variants. The latter data was collected through our participation in the Ovarian Cancer Association Consortium. A subset of this data is being supplied to dbGaP which will allow linkage of the genetic data to our extensive &#34;phenotypic&#34; data. Our goal is to show that many well established risk factors for ovarian cancer, some of which are modifiable, including talc use, smoking, pregnancy and breastfeeding history, oral contraceptive use, ovulatory cycles, hysterectomy and tubal ligation, menopausal hormone use, and medical and family history, may be modified by particular genetic variants. </p>",
    "inclusion_criteria": "<p>Cases with ovarian cancer were included if they resided in Eastern Massachusetts or New Hampshire during the study periods described above. Cases were ineligible if they had died, moved outside study area, did not have a working telephone number, or had a non-ovarian primary tumor. Non-epithelial cases were enrolled but were excluded from the analytic dataset.</p> <p>Controls were eligible if they fell into frequency matched categories of age and residence as an enrolled case. Controls were ineligible if they had died, moved, or were seriously ill or if they did not have a working telephone, speak English, or have ovaries.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Recurrence and/or metastasis occur in more than half of patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and pose the greatest threats to long-term survival. The genetic alterations underlying recurrent/metastatic HNSCC are unknown. This study represents the first whole exome sequencing (WES) cohort study of patient-matched tumor pairs in recurrent or metastatic HNSCC. Synchronous lymph node metastases are genetically more similar to their paired index primary tumors than metachronous recurrent tumors are. Newly arisen mutations in recurrent or metastatic tumors, may have therapeutic implications. Several genes were found to be mutated in multiple metastatic or recurrent tumors, but not in their respective primaries, including C17orf104, ITPR3, and DDR2. DDR2 mutations have been shown to confer enhanced sensitivity to Src-family kinase (SFK) inhibitors in other malignancies. Similarly, we found HNSCC cell lines harboring endogenous and engineered DDR2 mutations to be more sensitive to the SFK inhibitor dasatinib, than those with WT DDR2. This study outlines the first compendium of somatic mutations in primary, metastatic and/or recurrent HNSCC cancers that arise in individual patients; and demonstrates how such data can be used to interrogate potential predictive/prognostic biomarkers to inform and guide personalized therapy.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Nurses&#39; Health Study is an on-going prospective cohort study of women that was initiated in 1976. This specific study was part of a larger study to advance our knowledge of breast cancer etiology, expand the current knowledge of mammographic density, and clarify the relationship between mammographic density and breast cancer risk. We conducted a nested case control study of breast cancer among women who provided a blood sample. We then targeted our mammogram collection to participants that were selected as part of this nested case-control study (i.e. those who had provided a blood sample). The mammogram closest to the date of blood draw (~1989-1990) was used. We assessed mammographic breast density from digitized film images using a computer assisted thresholding method (Cumulus). The women in this study were genotyped using the Illumina Omni Express Platform. </p>",

The primary motivation in starting the NHS was to investigate the potential long term consequences of the use of oral contraceptives, a potent drug that was being prescribed to hundreds of millions of normal women.</p> <p>Registered nurses were selected to be followed prospectively. Married registered nurses who were aged 30 to 55 in 1976, who lived in the 11 most populous states and whose nursing boards agreed to supply the study with their members&#39; names and addresses were enrolled in the cohort if they responded to our baseline questionnaire. The original states were California, Connecticut, Florida, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Texas.</p> <p>Approximately 122,000 nurses out of the 170,000 mailed responded. Every two years cohort members receive a follow-up questionnaire with questions about diseases and health-related topics including smoking, hormone use and menopausal status. Similarly, to identify potential biomarkers, such as hormone levels and genetic markers, 33,000 blood samples were collected in 1989-90 followed by second samples from 18,700 of these participants in 2000-01. These samples are stored and used in case/control analyses.</p> <p>Additionally, we collected film screening mammograms from a subset of women to measure their mammographic density. </p>",

GWAS data are available for COGEND subjects through the Study of Addiction: Genetics and Environment (SAGE), dbGaP study accession phs000092. It should be noted that the case definition in the SAGE study is DSM-IV alcohol dependence. GWAS data are available for additional COGEND subjects through The Genetic Architecture of Smoking and Smoking Cessation, dbGaP study accession phs000404.</p> <p>The overall goal of this project is to apply deep sequencing to key genomic regions associated with nicotine dependence in order to accelerate the discovery of variation in molecular pathways that govern the development of nicotine dependence. The sample includes unrelated cases and controls of European American and African American descent. Cases are defined by a commonly used definition of nicotine dependence, a current score of 4 or more (maximum score of 10) on the Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND). Control status is defined as an individual who smoked at least 100 cigarettes during their lifetime, yet never became dependent (lifetime FTND&#60;2). By selecting controls who smoked cigarettes, we focus on those genetic effects that are specific to the development of nicotine dependence.</p> <p><b><u>COGEND:</u></b> COGEND was initiated in 2001 as a three-part program project grant funded through the National Cancer Institute (NCI; PI: Laura Bierut). The three projects included a study of the familial transmission of nicotine dependence, a genetic study of nicotine dependence, and a study of the relationship of nicotine dependence with nicotine metabolism. The primary goal was to detect, localize, and characterize genes that predispose or protect an individual with respect to heavy tobacco consumption, nicotine dependence, and related phenotypes and to integrate these findings with the family transmission and nicotine metabolism findings. The primary design was a community based case-control study. Nicotine dependent cases and non-dependent, smoking controls were identified and recruited from Detroit and St. Louis. More than 54,000 subjects aged 25-44 years were screened by telephone; more than 3,100 subjects were personally interviewed; and more than 2,900 subjects donated blood samples for genetic studies. </p> <p><b><u>AAND:</u></b> AAND was initiated in 2009 to identify and characterize genetic determinants of nicotine dependence in a large African American population. Community-based recruitment of approximately 100,000 people was conducted to ascertain 1,000 African American nicotine dependent cases and 1,000 African American non-dependent, smoking controls. All subjects were between the ages of 25-44. Subjects were screened by telephone; if they qualified as a case or control, they completed the same interview that was used in COGEND and donated a blood sample.</p> <p>Both studies (COGEND and AAND) included measures of basic socio-demographic variables, including age, sex, race/ethnicity, family income, and educational attainment using the Semi-Structured Assessment for the Genetics of Nicotine Dependence. Information on nicotine dependence, as assessed by the Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND) is available for all subjects. In addition, participants also completed the Nicotine Dependence Syndrome Scale (NDSS; Shiffman et al., 2004) and the Wisconsin Inventory of Smoking Dependence Motives (WISDM-68; Piper et al, 2004). All subjects were assessed in person by trained research assistants.</p>",

We performed low-coverage genome and high-coverage exome sequencing of 20 desmoplastic melanomas, followed by targeted sequencing of 293 genes to validate candidate genes. A high mutation burden (median 62 mutations/Mb) ranked desmoplastic melanoma among the most highly mutated cancers. Mutation patterns strongly implicate UV-radiation as the dominant mutagen, indicating a superficially located cell of origin. Novel alterations included recurrent promoter mutations of NF-kappa B inhibitor epsilon, NFKBIE (IkB&#949;) in 14.5% of samples. Commonly mutated oncogenes in melanomas, in particular BRAF(V600E) and NRAS(Q61K/R), were absent. Instead, other genetic alterations known to activate the MAPK and PI3K signaling cascades were identified in 73% of samples, affecting NF1, CBL, ERBB2, MAP2K1, MAP3K1, BRAF, EGFR, PTPN11, MET, RAC1, SOS2, NRAS, and PIK3CA, some of which being candidates for targeted therapies.</p> <p><i>Reprinted from:</i><br/> Shain, A.

Studies based on animal models indicate that differences in composition might be attributed to sex-mediated effects. We analyzed the relationship of sex, adiposity, and dietary fiber intake with gut microbial composition using fecal samples from human subjects. We explored the associations of these factors with metrics of community composition and specific taxon abundances. We found that men and women had significantly different microbial community composition and that women had reduced abundance of a major phylum. Adiposity was associated with gut microbiome composition and specifically in women but not in men. Fiber from fruits and vegetables and fiber from beans were each associated with increased abundance of specific bacterial taxa. These findings provide initial indications that sex, adiposity, and dietary fiber might play important roles in influencing the human gut microbiome. Better understanding of these factors may have significant implications for gastrointestinal health and disease prevention.</p>",

Despite HCC heterogeneity, a subset of LTR-derived ncRNAs were more than 10-fold up-regulated in the vast majority of samples. HCCs with a high LTR activity mostly had a viral etiology, were less differentiated and showed higher risk of recurrence.

In this study, we show that regional differences in mutation frequency are absent in portions of the genome that are not transcribed within cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas (cSCCs) with an XPC-\\- genetic background. The XPC-\\- genetic background predicates a loss of global genome nucleotide excision repair (GG-NER), thus our data shows that regional differences in mutation frequency are a result of differential access of DNA repair protein. Unexpectedly, we also note that greater transcription reduces mutations on both strands of genes in heterochromatin, and only to those levels observed in euchromatin, in a XPC-dependent fashion. Therefore, transcription likely reduces mutation prevalence by increasing access to DNA repair proteins. This tripartite relationship between DNA repair, transcription, and chromatin state shows a new cancer risk factor in human populations.</p>",

This array of symptoms includes skin patches, plaques and tumors as well as blood involvement and erythroderma. Because the genetic basis of CTCL is still poorly understood, we performed whole-exome sequencing on 11 MF/Sz samples and their matched, normal control DNA. Upon analyzing this data, we distilled a list of an additional 494 genes to be sequenced at depth. The majority of these 494 genes were sequenced in the exons alone, however, for a small subset of these genes we sequenced the entire genomic locus in search of structural variation events. This 494 gene targeted resequencing effort was performed upon 72 patients with MF/Sz and their matched, normal control DNA. An additional 5 MF/Sz and matched, normal DNA samples underwent whole genome amplification (WGA) prior to library preparation, which appears to have introduced mutations into these samples, however we also include them here. We additionally include 10 MF/Sz samples without a matched, normal control samples, 1 of which underwent WGA. In addition to primary disease samples, we also performed targeted resequencing on 4 CTCL cell lines (HH, MyLa, SeAx and Hut78) as well as on H9 cells (a subclone of Hut78 cells) and Jurkat cells, a T-ALL derived cell line that was used as an experimental system for our work. In sum, this data deposition includes exome and/or targeted resequencing from 92 individuals with 192 samples submitted.</p>",

The population-based component was a probability sample designed using the 2000 Ghana Population and Housing Census data in an attempt to recruit approximately 1,000 men aged 50-74 years in the Greater Accra region (~3 million people), which successfully recruited 1,037 healthy men between 2004 and 2006 with a response percentage of 98.8 %. Consented individuals underwent an in-person interview, and within 7 days had a digital rectal examination (DRE) and provided an overnight fasting blood sample for prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing, biomarker assays, and genetic analysis. Subjects who had a positive screen by PSA (>2.5 ng/ml) or DRE underwent a transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy. A total of 73 histologically confirmed prostate cancer cases were identified through the population-based screening component of the Ghana Prostate Study and were included in the case population in the published GWAS (Cook et al., Human genetics, 2013). From the remaining 964 screen-negative individuals, 836 had at least 20 &#956;g DNA extracted and available for analysis, and 500 of these were matched to cases for analysis by age (in 5-year categories).</p> <p>In the Ghana Prostate Study, we recruited 676 prostate cancer cases at Korle Bu Teaching Hospital in Accra, Ghana, between 2008 and 2012. All consented cases were interviewed and provided an overnight fasting blood sample. At the time of selection for this analysis we had recruited 582 prostate cancer cases, from which we selected 427 for analysis. Combined with the 73 cases diagnosed through the population-based component of the study, this yielded 500 available prostate cancer cases for analysis.</p>",

A further five cases were excluded for having less than 80% African ancestry using the HapMap build 26 data (CEU, JPT + CHB, YRI) as the continental reference populations in a STRUCTURE analysis. Principal components analysis (PCA) identified 16 individuals (5 cases, 11 controls) with significant deviation of eigenvectors and thus, they were excluded.

    "description": "<p><b>A genomewide study of lung cancer in never smokers</b></p> <p><b>Abstract and specific aims</b></p> <p>In the United States, lung cancer incidence and mortality rates have been steadily declining over the past decade, following decline in the prevalence of tobacco smoking. However, lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer death, killing more patients than breast, colon, and prostate cancers combined.</p> <p>Although tobacco smoke is the predominant risk factor for development of lung cancer, some patients develop the disease without a history of tobacco smoking. About 10 - 15% of all lung cancers occur in lilfetime never smokers. This figure will increase as the proportion of never smokers increases in the population. Even at present rates, lung cancer in never smokers, if considered a separate disease, is 6th to 8th top cause of cancer death.</p> <p>The growing number of never smokers in the USA and other countries emphasizes the importance of understanding the epidemiology and biology underlying lung cancer in this group.</p> <p>Genetic polymorphisms associated with the risk of lung cancer in never smokers are expected to overlap with those associated with the risk of lung cancer in ever smokers only partially. Epidemiological, molecular and clinical data suggest that molecular mechanisms of LC may differ in smokers and non-smokers, implying that lung cancer in never smokers is a different disease compared to the lung cancer in smokers. One can expect that there should be stronger genetic component in the control lung cancer in never smokers because effects of the genetic factors in never smokers are unmasked by the lack of tobacco smoke exposure.</p> <p>The genetic epidemiology of lung cancer in never smokers has not been well explored, largely because of difficulties in accruing the needed sample size for association studies. We propose a multicenter (total 14 sites from the US and Europe) genomewide association study of lung cancer in never smokers with the following specific aims:</p> <p><b>Aim 1: To identify candidate SNPs influencing risk for lung cancer in never smokers using Discovery sample.</b></p> <p>In the Discovery phase we will genotype 1256 Caucasian cases and 1365 age- and gender-matched never smoker controls using the Illumina Human660W-Quad platform. In addition, we will include in the analysis 284 cases and 175 matched controls already genotyped on the 610Quad platform. In this phase we will only include the study sites that have collected blood specimens (MDACC, Mayo Clinic, Karmanos Cancer Institute, The University of Liverpool Cancer research Centre, Institute of Cancer Research in Sutton, and Lunenfeld Research Institute in Toronto, Canada). All the samples will be sent to the independent lab for genotyping, to reduce site-specific technical artifacts. The final sample will consist of 1540 cases and 1540 controls matched by study site.</p> <p><b>Aim 2: To perform the second phase (validation) analysis of significant SNPs identified in aim 1 using an independent set of cases and controls.</b></p> <p>SNPs associated with risk at the significance level of 0.01 or below in the discovery set will be included in the replication phase. The proposed threshold guarantees an adequate power to retain SNPs with the typical effect size of 1.3. We plan to carry 6000-7000 SNPs for validation. The independent replication set will include 800 cases and 800 controls, mostly from sites that collected tissue (Mayo Clinic, Karmanos Cancer Institute, UT Southwestern) or buccal specimens (UCLA), but also blood samples (Imperial College London, University of Pennsylvana, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, National Research Center for Environment and Health, Neuherberg, Carmel Medical Center, Haifa). We will then perform a joint analysis to test the significance of the SNPs identified in the first stage using a stringent critical p-value of 10-7. There will be 2340 cases and 2340 controls in the joint set. Based on our experience with GWAS in smokers and assuming that genetic component in lung cancer risk in never smokers can be higher than genetic component in smokers, we expect to identify about 5-10 candidate regions associated with lung cancer risk in never smokers.</p> <p><b>Aim 3: To identify and explore pathways associated with the risk of lung cancer in never smokers.</b></p> <p>Results of the number of studies on the molecular mechanisms and drug response suggest that lung cancer in never smokers is a different disease and different pathways will be associated with lung cancer risk in non-smokers and smokers. To identify pathways and molecular functions associated with lung cancer risk in never smokers we will apply Ingenuity and DAVID bioinformatics tools. We will use at least 300 top candidate genes identified in joint and discovery analysis. The reason why we select rather large number of candidate genes for functional annotation is two-fold: 1. Both algorithms are looking for enrichment of pathways and function by most significant genes and they produce statistically robust results only when number of genes is relatively high. 2. Despite the fact that this study will be largest possible for never smokers we still are underpowered to detect SNPs with relatively small effect size. But though those SNPs will not reach genome wide level of significance they will tend to be on the top of the list. In other words genes from the gray zone (significant on individual level and non-significant for genome wide level) are expected to be enriched by true discoveries. True discoveries are likely to be associated with limited number of pathways / functions while false positives are expected to be uniformly distributed across functions and pathways. Therefore significant clustering of the gene to a given function will suggest that that those genes are true discoveries.</p> <p>This is the first GWAS aiming at identifying the genetic control of susceptibility to lung cancer in Caucasian never smokers. We will combine the available resources from the multiple sites to achieve the sample size sufficient for this study. The study will identify genetic architecture of the predisposition to the lung cancer in never smokers.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The NCI GWAS of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in African Americans was undertaken to provide insight into genetic loci affecting susceptibility to this malignancy in a racial group known to be at elevated risk. We genotyped 1,136,723 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) among 255 cases and 375 controls of African ancestry from the NCI Kidney Cancer Study, and further investigated 16 SNPs in a replication set consisting of 140 cases and 543 controls from a case-control study conducted at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. The variant rs10771279 located on 12p11, 77kb from a European-ancestry RCC risk marker, was associated with RCC risk in the GWAS (P=1.2 x 10-7) but did not replicate (P=0.99). The variant 7105934 on 11q13.3, previously associated with RCC in a GWAS using European-ancestry samples, was associated with risk in both studies [meta-analysis odds ratio (OR)=0.76, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.64-0.91; P=0.0022]. The frequency of this allele was higher than that observed in the European-ancestry GWAS (0.56 and 0.07 respectively among controls). The rs7105934 association was stronger for clear cell RCC (ccRCC: OR=0.56; P=7.4 x 10-7) and absent for cases of other or unknown histology (OR=1.02; P=0.86). In conclusion, this study provides evidence that rs7105934 is a susceptibility locus for RCC, and clear-cell RCC in particular, among African Americans.</p>",

    "description": "<p>This study funded by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) involves conducting a genome-wide association study of common genetic variants to identify markers of susceptibility to bladder cancer.</p> <p>This bladder GWAS has led to the discovery of three novel regions in the genome associated with bladder cancer risk. Cases were defined as individuals having histologically confirmed primary carcinoma of the urinary bladder, including carcinoma in situ (ICD-0-2 topography codes C67.0-C67.9 or ICD9 codes 188.1-188.9). Scan data were obtained from two case-control studies carried out in Spain and the United States (specifically, those in the Maine and Vermont components of the New England Bladder Cancer Study) and three prospective cohort studies in Finland and the United States (specifically Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention Study, Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial, and The American Cancer Society Cancer Prevention Study II Nutrition Cohort).</p> <p>We used data from 591,637 single nucleotide polymorphisms 3,532 affected individuals (cases) and 5,119 controls of European descent and replication including 8382 cases and 48275 controls from 16 studies. In a combined analysis, we identified three new regions associated with bladder cancer on chromosomes 22q13.1, 19q12 and 2q37.1: rs1014971, (P &#8776; 8 x 10<sup>-12</sup>) maps to a non-genic region of chromosome 22q13.1, rs8102137 (P = 2 x 10<sup>-11</sup>) on maps to CCNE1 and rs11892031 (P = 1 x 10<sup>-7</sup>) maps to the UGT1A cluster on 2q37.1. We confirmed four previously identified genome-wide associations on chromosomes 3q28, 4p16.3, 8q24.21 and 8q24.3 (Rothman N et al., Nature Genetics, 2010, PMID: <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20972438\" target=\"_blank\">20972438</a>). Through meta-analysis with the MD Anderson Texas Bladder Cancer Study (TXBCS), we also identified a novel susceptibility locus that mapped to a region of 18q12.3, marked by rs7238033 (P = 8.7 x 10(-9); allelic odds ratio 1.20 with 95% CI: 1.13-1.28) and two highly correlated SNPs, rs10775480/rs10853535 (r(2)= 1.00; P = 8.9 x 10(-9); allelic odds ratio 1.16 with 95% CI: 1.10-1.22) (Garcia-Closas M et al, Human Molecular Genetics, 2011) </p> <p>For NCI-GWAS2, we performed genotyping on cases and controls for the New Hampshire component of the New England Bladder Cancer Study (NEBCS-NH). For the majority of new bladder cancer cases, we genotyped only cases from four case-control studies, the Los Angeles Bladder Cancer Study (LABCS), the French Center for Research on Prostate Diseases (CeRePP), the French Bladder Study (FBCS) and the Brescia Bladder Cancer Study (BBCS). We used existing control data from four cohort studies already genotyped and subjected to rigorous quality control metrics: the European Prospective Investigation Into Cancer and Nutrition Study (EPIC), Womens Health Initiative (WHI), Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS), Nurses Health Study (NHS), which have been a part of Cancer Genetic Markers of Susceptibility (CGEMS).</p> <p>Meta-analysis of NCI-GWAS1, NCI-GWAS2 and a previously reported GWAS TXBCS-GWAS along with taqman replication, identified two new loci: rs10936599 on 3q26.2 (P = 4.53 x 10(-9)) and rs907611 on 11p15.5 (P = 4.11 x 10(-8)). Two notable loci were also identified that approached genome-wide statistical significance: rs6104690 on 20p12.2 (P = 7.13 x 10(-7)) and rs4510656 on 6p22.3 (P = 6.98 X 10(-7)); these require further studies for confirmation (Figueroa J et al, Human Molecular Genetics, 2013).</p>",
    "history": "<p>Bladder cancer is a major public health problem with high disease management costs because of high recurrence of tumors requiring frequent screening and interventions (of particular relevant for early stage tumors). There are well-known epidemiologic factors that are associated with increased risk for bladder cancer: smoking and occupational exposure to aromatic amines, important clues for environmental, medication use, and lifestyle risk factors, as well as fluid balance and urine pH. The portfolio of established risk factors should provide opportunities to evaluate risk factors stratified by genotype and genetic factors within distinct exposure subgroups. There is also good evidence for a genetic component, given that previous studies have demonstrated reproducible associations with NAT2 and GSTM1 genotypes. Further, gene-environment interactions have been shown for smoking and specific NAT2 genotypes. The modest familial association has not yet been adequately explained but supports the need to search for genetic markers associated with bladder cancer. Together these observations provide a strong case for investigation of multi-genic associations as well as gene-environment interactions. Excellent information on clinical outcomes including survival and tumor recurrence is available for exploration of the influence of genetic variants on these outcomes, which could have potentially important clinical implications. Results from a GWAS leading to the identification of genetic makers could provide major insights into novel regions that regulate new mechanisms underlying bladder cancer pathogenesis. Findings from the GWAS could also provide etiological clues leading to the identification of additional modifiable factors that increase bladder cancer risk, recurrence and survival. The potential is great for advancing the understanding of the genetic contribution to bladder cancer, which could establish the foundation for developing novel approaches towards prevention while decreasing the burden of bladder cancer.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The genome-wide association study (GWAS) includes participants enrolled into two different studies. The first study, the San Francisco Bay Area Cancer Study (SFBCS) is a population-based case-control study of breast cancer conducted in the San Francisco Bay Area and included women ages 35-79 years from three racial/ethnic groups: Non-Hispanic whites, African Americans, and Hispanics/Latinas. For the GWAS, only Hispanic/Latina women were included. Women diagnosed with invasive breast cancer between 1995 and 2002 were identified through the Greater Bay Area Cancer Registry. Controls were identified by random digit dialing and were frequency-matched to cases by age in 5 year increments and by race/ethnicity. Hispanic/Latina ethnicity was assessed by self-report. 175 Hispanic/Latina cases and 307 Hispanic/Latina controls from the SFBCS had given adequate consent and provided biospecimens that were used in the GWAS to be included in this data submission.</p> <p>The second study is the Northern California site of the Breast Cancer Family Registry (NC-BCFR). This population-based family study recruited breast cancer cases ages 18-64 years diagnosed from 1995-2009 that were identified through the Greater Bay Area Cancer Registry. Cases included all women at increased genetic susceptibility for breast cancer who met one or more of the following criteria: (a) being diagnosed with breast cancer at age &#60;35 years; b) having a personal history of ovarian cancer or childhood cancer; (c) being diagnosed with two different breast cancers (bilateral breast cancers), with the first one diagnosed at age &#60;50 years; and d) having one or more first-degree relatives with breast cancer, ovarian cancer or childhood cancer. Cases not meeting these criteria were randomly sampled and racial/ethnic minorities were oversampled. Controls were recruited by random digit dialing and were matched by 5-year age increments and by race/ethnicity. For the current GWAS only Latina/Hispanic cases and controls were included. Latina/Hispanic ethnicity was assessed by self-report. 631 Hispanic/Latina cases and 61 Hispanic/Latina controls from the NC-BCFR had given adequate consent and provided biospecimens that were used in the GWAS to be included in this data submission.</p>",
    "history": "<p>The San Francisco Bay Area Cancer Study recruited cases and controls between 199X and 200X. The Cancer Family Registry recruited cases and controls between 199X and 200X.</p> <p>The SFBCS was used to demonstrate that ancestry is associated with breast cancer risk (Fejerman et al Cancer Research 2008). The investigators used 106 ancestry informative markers to infer genetic ancestry for all of the women in the study. They found that European ancestry was associated with higher risk of breast cancer while Indigenous American ancestry was associated with lower risk.</p> <p>The GWAS was performed on stored biospecimens between 2008 and 2010. The first analysis of the GWAS data used an admixture mapping approach to identify loci at which ancestry was associated with risk (Fejerman et al Hum Mol Genetics 2012). This analysis also included Hispanic/Latina women from the Multi-ethnic cohort which are not included in this dbGAP submission. The investigators identified 6q25 as a locus by admixture mapping. The investigators then fine mapped this region and replicated in additional datasets (Fejerman et al Nature Communications 2014). They found two SNPs in linkage disequilibrium at 6q25 that were associated with breast cancer risk. The minor allele for these SNPs was only common in women with some Indigenous American ancestry and was highly protective for breast cancer. In addition, the investigators replicated several previously identified SNPs associated with breast cancer at different loci in other populations, although only SNPs at the TOX3 locus met the criteria for genome wide significance.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Breast and Prostate Cancer Cohort Consortium (BPC3) was established in 2003 to pool data and biospecimens from nine large prospective cohorts to conduct research on gene-environment interactions in cancer etiology. The BPC3 initially focused on the association of >70 candidate genes in the Steroid Hormone Metabolism and IGF pathways with risk of breast and prostate cancer. The Consortium's work expanded in 2007 to include genome-wide association studies of estrogen receptor negative (ER-) breast cancer and aggressive prostate cancer. ER- breast cancers have specific epidemiologic characteristics and greater lethality, suggesting ER- breast cancer has a different etiology than ER+ breast cancer. Similarly, aggressive forms of prostate cancer, characterized by extraprostatic extension (Stage C/D) or high histologic grade (Gleason score 8+), differ epidemiologically from the vastly more common indolent forms of prostate cancer and are of the greatest clinical importance. By restricting cases to these specific subtypes, the BPC3 GWAS increased power to detect loci associated with ER- and aggressive prostate cancer (Kraft P and Haiman CA, Nature Genetics 2010 Oct;42:819-20, <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Nature+Genetics+2010+Oct%3B42%3A819-20/html/\">PMID: 20877320</a> ).</p> <p>The BPC3 GWAS includes the following cohorts: the American Cancer Society Cancer Prevention Study-II (CPS-II); the European Prospective Investigation of Cancer (EPIC); the Physician's Health Study (PHS); the Nurses' Health Studies I and II (NHS and NHSII); the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS); the Multiethnic Cohort (MEC); the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial; and the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene (ATBC) Study.</p> <p>For the GWAS of ER- cancer, the BPC3 was expanded to include the Polish Breast Cancer Study (PBCS), a population-based case-control study.</p>",

Subject recruitment in the initial phase of the SBCS (SBCS-I) was conducted between August 1996 and March 1998. The second phase (SBCS-II) of recruitment occurred between April 2002 and February 2005. Breast cancer cases were identified through the population-based Shanghai Cancer Registry and supplemented by a rapid case-ascertainment system. Controls were randomly selected using the Shanghai Resident Registry. Approximately 3500 cases and 3500 controls were recruited in the study.</p> <p><b>Shanghai Breast Cancer Survival Study (SBCSS) and Shanghai Endometrial Cancer Study (SECS):</b> The SBCSS also used the population-based Shanghai Cancer Registry to identify newly diagnosed breast cancer cases. A total of 5,046 breast cancer patients were recruited. In-person interviews were conducted to collect information on known breast cancer risk factors and anthropometrics by using a protocol and questionnaire similar to those used in the SBCS. For genetic studies, controls for the SBCSS cases came from the SECS, which recruited healthy women between January 1997 and December 2003. With the exception of a few questions related specifically to breast or endometrial cancer risk, the questionnaires used in the SECS and the SBCS were very similar.</p> <p><b>Shanghai Women&#39;s Health Study (SWHS):</b> The SWHS is a population-based prospective cohort study of approximately 75,000 adult women who were recruited between 1997 and 2000. The cohort has been followed by a combination of record linkage and active follow-ups. Breast cancer patients identified in the SWHS and non-cases were included in the current study.</p>",

State drivers&#39; license files were the primary sources used to identify study subjects in Hawaii and California. Additionally, in Hawaii, state voter&#39;s registration files were used, and, in California, Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) files were used to identify additional African American study subjects. In the cohort, incident cancer cases are identified annually through cohort linkage to population-based cancer Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registries in Hawaii and Los Angeles County as well as to the California State cancer registry. Information on estrogen receptor status is also obtained through these registries. Blood sample collection in the MEC began in 1994 and targeted incident breast cancer cases and a random sample of study participants to serve as controls for genetic analyses. Subjects are frequency matched on age at blood draw and ethnicity. The following number of breast cancer cases and controls were genome-wide scanned as part of this study: African Americans, 473 cases and 464 controls; Japanese: 885 cases and 822 controls; Latinos, 520 cases and 544 controls.</p>",

    "description": "<p><b><u>Background</u></b><br/> National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) trial B-31 suggested the efficacy of adjuvant trastuzumab, even in HER2-negative breast cancer. This finding prompted us to develop a predictive model for degree of benefit from trastuzumab using archived tumor blocks from B-31. </p> <p><b><u>Methods</u></b><br/> Case subjects with tumor blocks were randomly divided into discovery (n = 588) and confirmation cohorts (n = 991). A predictive model was built from the discovery cohort through gene expression profiling of 462 genes with nCounter assay. A predefined cut point for the predictive model was tested in the confirmation cohort. Gene-by-treatment interaction was tested with Cox models, and correlations between variables were assessed with Spearman correlation. Principal component analysis was performed on the final set of selected genes. All statistical tests were two-sided. </p> <p><b><u>Results</u></b><br/> Eight predictive genes associated with HER2 (ERBB2, c17orf37, GRB7) or ER (ESR1, NAT1, GATA3, CA12, IGF1R) were selected for model building. Three-dimensional subset treatment effect pattern plot using two principal components of these genes was used to identify a subset with no benefit from trastuzumab, characterized by intermediate-level ERBB2 and high-level ESR1 mRNA expression. In the confirmation set, the predefined cut points for this model classified patients into three subsets with differential benefit from trastuzumab with hazard ratios of 1.58 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.67 to 3.69; P = .29; n = 100), 0.60 (95% CI = 0.41 to 0.89; P = .01; n = 449), and 0.28 (95% CI = 0.20 to 0.41; P &#60; .001; n = 442; P interaction between the model and trastuzumab &#60; .001). </p> <p><b><u>Conclusions</u></b><br/> We developed a gene expression-based predictive model for degree of benefit from trastuzumab and demostrated that HER2-negative tumors belong to the moderate benefit group, thus providing justification for testing trastuzumab in HER2-negative patients (NSABP B-47).</p> <p>** Reprinted from J Natl Cancer Inst;2013;105:1782-1788 with permission from Oxford University Press.</p>",

These data suggest the potential utility of specific drug combinations and provides evidence of in vivo treatment efficacy of the multi-histone deacetylase inhibitor panobinostat. We are depositing to dbGaP deep sequencing whole exome data for 22 patient tumor samples and 13 matched normals, along with RNAseq data for 12 patient tumor samples and 6 normal pediatric brain tissue samples.

A major barrier, however, is the inaccessibility of adequate metastatic tissue for accurate genomic analysis in prostate and other cancers. A potential solution is to characterize circulating tumor cells (CTCs), but this requires overcoming multiple technical hurdles. Here, we report an integrated process to isolate, qualify, and sequence whole exomes of CTCs with high fidelity, using a census-based sequencing strategy. Power calculations suggest that mapping of over 99.995% of the territory accessible in bulk exome sequencing is possible in CTCs. We validated our sequencing process in two prostate cancer patients including one for whom we compared CTC-derived mutations to mutations found in a lymph node metastasis and nine cores of the primary tumor. 51 of 73 CTC mutations (70%) were observed in matched tissue. Moreover, we identified 10 early trunk mutations and 56 metastatic trunk mutations in the non-CTC tumor samples and found 90% and 73% of these, respectively, in CTC exomes. This study establishes a foundation for CTC genomics in the clinic.</p>",

Here we identify the spectrum of somatic mutations that co-occur with loss of <i>CUX1</i> and chromosome 7 in patients with <i>de novo</i> acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or a therapy-related myeloid neoplasm. -7/del(7q) leukemias have a distinct mutational profile characterized by low frequencies of alterations in major leukemogenic pathways, including genes encoding transcription factors, cohesin, and DNA-methylation-related proteins. In contrast, RAS pathway activating mutations occurred in 40% of -7/del(7q) samples, a significantly higher frequency than other AMLs and higher than previously reported. As targeted therapeutics advance, our data provide guidance for which pathways are most relevant in the treatment of adverse-risk myeloid leukemia. </p>",

    "description": "<p>Multiple GWA studies of prostate cancer conducted in European White populations are ongoing. These studies will continue to have a dramatic impact on our understanding of the contribution of common genetic variation on inter-individual susceptibility to this common cancer. Important questions that will remain unanswered, however, are whether all common risk alleles for prostate cancer will be revealed in studies limited to populations of European ancestry. A comprehensive examination of common genetic variation in men of Japanese, Latino, and African ancestry will be required to understand population differences in disease risk and to reveal the full spectrum of causal alleles that exist in these populations. Further, genetic and environmental diversity is likely to contribute to ethnic heterogeneity of genetic effects. Elucidating gene x gene and gene x environment interactions is also likely to provide knowledge that may be critical for understanding the contribution of genetic susceptibility to racial/ethnic disparities in prostate cancer incidence and for translating the findings from GWA studies into interventions.</p> <p>In this study we plan to undertake a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of prostate cancer in the Multiethnic Cohort (MEC) Study. We propose the following hypotheses: (a) that inherited DNA variation influences risk of prostate cancer; (b) that many of the causal alleles will be outside known \"candidate genes\" requiring an agnostic, comprehensive search; and (c) that performing this search in a multi-ethnic cohort is more powerful than a study limited to a single population to reveal the full range of causal alleles relevant to the U.S. population.</p> <p>The version 1 release of this dataset will include genotype data for the Japanese and Latino populations in the study. The version 2 release will include data for the African ancestry population along with the Japanese and Latino subjects. The version 3 release will include fully-cleaned genotype data for all three populations.</p> <p>This study is part of the Gene Environment Association Studies initiative (GENEVA, <a href=\"http://www.genevastudy.org\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.genevastudy.org</a>) funded by the trans-NIH Genes, Environment, and Health Initiative (GEI). The overarching goal is to identify novel genetic factors that contribute to prostate cancer through large-scale genome-wide association studies of a well-characterized multi-ethnic cohort. Genotyping was performed at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, a GENEVA genotyping center and at the University of Southern California. Data cleaning and harmonization were performed at the GEI-funded GENEVA Coordinating Center at the University of Washington.

All SFTs examined exhibited an in-frame fusion transcript encoding a fusion protein containing the EGR1 interaction domain of NAB2 with the transcriptional activation domain of STAT6. Functional testing of the fusion alleles confirmed the conversion of the wt NAB2 repressor into a transcriptional activator. A range of individual fusion junctions can be detected by next-generation sequencing acro the sample set, highlighting the suitability of this method in the diagnostic characterization of SFTs. This study indentified the pathognomonic alteration in solitary fibrous tumors and illuminates a pathway towards targeted therapeutics for this cancer.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The paucity of data on the genetic epidemiology of breast cancer for racial/ethnic groups other than those of European ancestry hinders the development of innovative interventions to reduce health disparities. Women in the African Diaspora experience a disproportionate burden of pre-menopausal breast cancer in comparison to all other races for reasons that remain unknown and understudied. This higher proportion of early-onset breast cancer might suggest a stronger genetic component in these populations. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have revealed several genetic loci that confer risk of breast cancer. Because all GWAS started the discovery stage in women of European ancestry and replicated mainly in women of European ancestry, we propose a novel approach for a GWAS in indigenous African women to identify alleles associated with breast cancer risk which will then be replicated in other populations. This innovative design builds on our current understanding of the etiologic heterogeneity in breast cancer and the distribution of breast cancer molecular subtypes which differ between women of African ancestry and women of European ancestry. The major objective of the proposed studies is to get to the \"root\" causes of breast cancer by identifying breast cancer risk alleles in a pooled sample of women of African ancestry and to replicate our findings in other populations.</p> <p>To achieve this objective, we conducted a case control study of breast cancer in women of African ancestry, including Africans living in Nigeria, African Americans and African Barbadians. We will genotype ~3800 individuals using the Illumina HumanOmni2.5-Quad platform. We will conduct both standard and novel genetic analyses of the data to map genes associated with breast cancer susceptibility, verify genotyping and carry out fine-mapping studies in genes or regions showing association with breast cancer risk, and replicate in other African American and non-African American populations. By pooling unique resources from studies throughout the African Diaspora, this study has the potential to identify risk alleles in several genes that contribute to increased breast cancer risk and may have implications for early detection, prognosis and treatment of breast cancer in ALL women. This should ultimately lead to improved outcomes for those who suffer a disproportionate burden of early-onset breast cancer.</p>",

The study utilized several molecular technologies to assess immune profiles and tumor microenvironment (TME) changes: high-dimensional mass cytometry by time of flight (CyTOF), Luminex for chemokine analysis in plasma, multiplexed immunohistochemistry (mIHC), image cytometry-based quantification, bulk RNA sequencing analysis. The objective response rate (ORR) was 11% with three patients showing a partial response (PR). The median duration of response was 10.2 months. Grade &#8805; 3 treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) occurred in 63% of patients, with the most common being decreased lymphocyte count, anemia, hypoalbuminemia, and hyponatremia. Gene expression analysis showed an enrichment in inflammatory response signaling pathways with the combination treatment. RNA sequencing data with clinical and demographic patient information will be available through dbGaP.

    "description": "<p>Blood-based 'liquid biopsy' is increasingly utilized in clinical care of cancer patients and the fraction of tumor-derived DNA in circulation ('tumor fraction', TFx) has demonstrated clinical utility across multiple cancer types. To determine TFx, shallow whole genome sequencing of cell-free DNA can be performed from a single blood sample, using an established computational pipeline (ichorCNA), without prior knowledge of tumor mutations, in a highly cost effective manner. We describe assay validation of this approach to facilitate broad clinical application, including evaluation of assay sensitivity, precision, repeatability, reproducibility, pre-analytic factors, and DNA quality/quantity. Specifically, experimental dilutions with normal donor plasma established lower limit of detection; precision was demonstrated on distinct sequencing instruments (Illumina HiSeqX and NovaSeq) with no observable differences; the assay achieved >95% agreement of TFx across paired sample replicates of the same specimen (repeatability) and duplicate samples in different batches (reproducibility). Comparison of samples collected in distinct tube types from single venipuncture, processed over diverse timeframes, and using a range of DNA inputs (1ng-50ng) established pre-analytical variables impacting TFx success. Finally, serial samples from advanced breast cancer patients on treatment facilitate the range of TFx dynamics under pressure. Overall, this shallow whole genome sequencing of cell-free DNA and ichorCNA approach offers sensitive, precise, and reproductible quantitation of TFx, facilitating assay application in clinical cancer care.</p>",

    "description": "<div>\n</div><div>LGL leukemia results from a clonal expansion of cytotoxic T lymphocytes with a terminal effector memory (TEMRA) phenotype. LGL leukemia patients have multiple clinical phenotypes including chronic neutropenia, pure red cell aplasia, and rheumatoid arthritis. The major focus of this project is to identify and understand how genomic changes contribute to the pathogenesis of LGL leukemia as well as normal TEMRA biology. Our collaborative group has completed whole genome sequencing of matched LGL clone and normal saliva samples from 50 genome pairs. Preliminary analyses of these genome pairs indicate an average of 8,000 somatic DNA substitutions as well as evidence of copy number variation and other genome structural changes. Our goal is to understand how these genome changes contribute to the genesis and pathological manifestations of LGL leukemia. We focus on analyzing the protein coding changes as well as identifying the numerous other genomic changes with less rapidly definable function. In order to gain a more complete understanding of how non-coding genome changes contribute to LGL we are also conducting a series of ENCODE type experiments to identify important genomic regions in LGL. We will have utilized targeted resequencing and whole exome sequencing to screen our large patient registry to determine the prevalence of these mutations in LGL leukemia and will integrate the newly identified interaction data and mutation data into our network model of LGL leukemia survival pathways. In addition, we have correlated mutations with clinical parameters to determine their usefulness in predicting treatment responses to current therapies and individual disease phenotypes.\n</div><div>\n</div><div><br></div><div>March 2021:  WGS sequence data submitted for paired tumor-normal NK-LGL leukemia samples\n</div><div>March 2021:  RRBS sequence data submitted for TET2 wild-type NK-LGL leukemia (n=3) and TET2 mutant NK-LGL leukemia (n=3)\n</div><div><br></div>",

This area is settled by the Luo tribe (85% of the population), a Nilotic group, which migrated from the Sudan regions of Africa, and the Kuria, a mixture of Nilotic and Bantu tribes. Control samples were obtained from members of similar families from the same location but who did not have BL cases reported in their family were also sampled. The family study collected data from 320 individuals in 12 families with two or more BL cases (familial BL families, n=63), 36 families with single BL cases (sporadic BL families, n=185), and 18 without BL (control families, n=72). Multiple blood specimens were taken from family members at different times. In addition, samples were obtained from random BL cases presenting at Shirati hospital (case set) and from unrelated community members (mostly adults) who did not have a history of BL (control set). These specimens are biobanked at DCEG and available for study. The current study analyzed whole exome sequences from the unrelated BL cases and from a set of unrelated controls.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Background: Adenomatous polyps are the most common precursor to colorectal cancer (CRC), the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States. We sought to learn more about early events of carcinogenesis by investigating shifts in the gut microbiota of patients with adenomas.</p> <p>Methods: We analyzed 16S rRNA gene sequences from the fecal microbiota of patients with adenomas (n=233) and without (n=547).</p> <p>Results: Multiple taxa were significantly more abundant in patients with adenomas, including Bilophila, Desulfovibrio, pro-inflammatory bacteria in the genus Mogibacterium, and multiple Bacteroidetes species. Patients without adenomas had greater abundances of Veillonella, Firmicutes (Order Clostridia), and Actinobacteria (family Bifidobacteriales). Many of our findings were consistent with previously reported shifts in the gut microbiota of CRC patients. Importantly, the altered adenoma profile is predicted to increase primary and secondary bile acid production, as well as starch, sucrose, lipid, and phenylpropanoid metabolism. </p> <p>Conclusions: These data suggest that diets rich in refined sugar, protein, and lipids may lead to increased bile acid production, creating a colonic environment that promotes the growth of bile-tolerant microbes such as Bilophilia and Desulfovibrio. In turn, these microbes may produce genotoxic or inflammatory metabolites such as H2S and secondary bile acids, catalyzing adenoma development and eventually CRC.</p> <p>Impact: This study suggests a plausible biological mechanism to explain the links between diet, shifts in the microbiota, and CRC. This represents a first step toward resolving the complex interactions that shape the adenoma-carcinoma sequence of CRC and may facilitate personalized therapeutics focused on the microbiota.</p>",
    "history": "<p>The original study (fecal collection) was conducted between 2001-2005 at multiple medical centers around the United States. Patients who presented for standard colonoscopic screenings submitted self-collected fecal samples that were shipped on ice overnight to Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN. After sample collection, patients went on to colonoscopy and were included in the study if they were diagnosed as having healthy (polyp-free) colons, adenomas (&#62;1cm), or colorectal cancer. Fecal samples were stored at -80C until processing. In 2014, DNA from fecal samples was extracted and submitted for 16S sequencing.</p>",

Here, using xenografting and DNA copy number alteration (CNA) profiling of human \tBCR-ABL1 lymphoblastic leukaemia, we demonstrate that genetic diversity occurs in functionally defined leukaemia-initiating \tcells (L-ICs) and that many diagnostic patient samples contain multiple genetically distinct L-IC subclones. Reconstructing \tthe subclonal genetic ancestry of several samples by CNA profiling demonstrated a branching multi-clonal evolution model of \tleukaemogenesis, rather than linear succession. For some patient samples, the predominant diagnostic clone repopulated \txenografts, while in others it was outcompeted by minor subclones. Reconstitution with the predominant diagnosis clone was \tassociated with more aggressive growth properties in xenografts, deletion of CDKN2A/B, and poor patient outcome. Our findings \tlink clonal diversity with L-IC function and underscore the importance of developing therapies that eradicate all \tintratumoural subclones.</p>",
