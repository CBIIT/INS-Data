26114002B91,Development and Expansion of Digital Tools to Support Smoking Cessation,"Earlier this year, NCI launched the Cancer Center Cessation Initiative. Begun as part of the Cancer Moonshot℠, the initiative is intended to provide resources for NCI-designated cancer centers (Centers) to expand existing efforts intended to help their patients who are smokers to stop smoking. The purpose of the initiative is to provide financial and technical support to cancer centers to over 40 Centers across the US that they will use to increase their resources for smoking cessation, to implement more comprehensive cessation services, and to provide those services to more patients being treated at their centers—what we call “reach.” This Task Order will support the development and extension of web-based and digital tools creating a virtual toolkit that Centers may draw from to extend their engagement, research, and evaluation efforts.",2019-09-15T12:09:00Z,2020-09-14T12:09:00Z,,award_26114002B91019F00132-0-0-1,"ICF MACRO, INC.",Reston,VA,UNITED STATES,c3i
26120080000,Burkitt Lymphoma Genome Sequencing Project (BLGSP),"Burkitt Lymphoma (BL) patients would benefit from improved treatment modalities. Current chemotherapy is ineffective in approximately 20% of cases and is associated with therapy-induced toxicity and death. BL patients over 70 years of age are ineligible for potentially curative therapy because of the toxicity. Young individuals exposed to the intensive regimens face the real possibility of secondary malignancies years later. Finally, African children with endemic BL in general do not receive these curative chemotherapy regimens due to the lack of hospital support for the management of post-treatment infections, and consequently most will die of their disease. The overall goal of the project are, (not all of them funded by the YT: to develop a comprehensive database of molecular changes in Burkitt Lymphoma (BL)and make the data available to the scientific community. This will be accomplished by comprehensive molecular characterization of the DNA and RNA from BL cases, analysis of the results to identify molecular alterations (mutations or other changes), and define affected pathways, correlations between genotype and phenotype and others Determine the frequency of these alterations in another cohort.

P20CA242611,2/2 Howard-Georgetown Collaborative Partnership in Cancer Research,"Overall Abstract The overarching goal of the NCI Collaborative P20 Partnership in Cancer Research is to enhance cancer research capacity at Howard University and increase participation in cancer health disparities research at Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center (GU). The Partnership goals will be achieved through two primary mechanisms: pilot research projects and cancer research education. The P20 will benefit from the guidance of an Internal Advisory Committee (IAC) made up of highly qualified and experienced scientists. The Research Pilot Projects will fund four 2-year collaborative research pilot projects. Each project will include at least one investigator from Howard and one from Georgetown. The investigators will benefit from the HU/GU CTSA and the Shared Resources available at GU. Pilot project 1 will identify candidate genes and genetic pathways associated with Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD). The research will inform possible biological mechanisms underlying the molecular and genetic signatures of perturbed metabolic and mechanistic pathways in NAFLD patients in an African–American population. Results may lead to innovative non-invasive biomarkers. Research Project 2 will investigate disparities in chronic stress, quality of life, and physical activity among Black and White breast cancer survivors. This study will provide insight into whether an association exists between physical activity and allostatic load in breast cancer survivors. During the course of the award, the P20 Partnership will elicit two additional pilot studies through a competitive process which will be driven by a merit review by the IAC. The expected outcome of the pilot projects is the submission of successful collaborative grant applications supported by the preliminary data obtained via the pilot research. The C-REP will contribute to the goals of the Partnership by engaging a diverse group students and faculty who are under-represented as investigators in biomedical research. A cohort consisting of a mix of college students in their junior or senior year, graduate and professional students will be recruited annually for an intensive 8-week mentored summer research experience. Follow-up mentoring will be provided to promote entry into a graduate or professional program or postdoctoral research training. Postdoctoral fellows and faculty will receive training and mentoring to support attaining a robust, high quality publication record and submission of highly competitive independent research proposals. Mentoring within the C-REP will occur via teams of at least one faculty member from both institutions.

P20CA242619,1/2 Drug Development and Capacity Building: A UCR/CoH-CCC Partnership,"ABSTRACT Cancer drugs in the United States are almost exclusively developed by, tested in, and optimized for European- Americans. Disparities in U.S. drug development are the result of long-standing inequalities that occur throughout the entire drug discovery pipeline. Only a small number of basic, translational and clinical scientists are Latino/Hispanic or Black/African-American. Less than 2-5% of trial participants are Latino/Hispanic or Black/African-American. Yet, in spite of a lack of data, new drugs are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and subsequently prescribed for Latino/Hispanic or Black/African-American patients, without sufficient testing. It is unacceptable, especially in this era of the Precision Medicine Initiative (PMI), that currently our drugs are developed by, and optimized for, only for an exclusive segment of our citizens.

P20CA253255,2/2 Cherokee Nation/OSU and SCC Collaborative Partnership for Cancer Research,"Abstract A serious shortage of scientists conducting AI cancer disparities research persists, which may have contributed to cancer disparities affecting tribal nations. Cherokee Nation and the Stephenson Cancer Center have partnered to build tribal cancer research capacity through a previous “Partnerships to Advance Cancer Health Equity (PACHE)” P20 planning grant. However, it was recognized that further expansion and sustainability of Cherokee Nation's cancer research workforce requires increased access to an academic ally with a large number of AI students entering scientific fields. Oklahoma State University fulfills this need, as one of the nation's leading universities for AI students and Early Stage Investigators (ESIs). The overall mission of the proposed Cherokee Nation/Oklahoma State University (OSU) and Stephenson Cancer Center (SCC) Collaborative for Cancer Research is to develop durable research capacity within the context of an American Indian (AI) tribal nation to address cancer disparities. To achieve this goal, the four Specific Aims of the Collaborative are: 1. to strengthen administrative infrastructure, including a joint Internal Advisory Committee that ensures integration of cancer research education and outreach and pilot research activities among Cherokee Nation, OSU, and the SCC; 2. to conduct innovative pilot research in tobacco use and cancer risk capable of seeding large-scale research projects performed by AI researchers within the Cherokee Nation setting; 3. to educate the next generation of cancer researchers to engage meaningfully with Cherokee Nation in the context of this research, focusing on ESIs, graduate, professional, and undergraduate students; and 4. to evaluate activities of the partnership, including monitoring progress of pilot research projects and the cancer research education program (C-REP). This evaluation will inform future, jointly executed efforts to reduce AI cancer disparities. The Collaborative provides a crucial opportunity to solidify the foundation for tribal capacity in cancer disparities research. The addition of OSU strengthens the Collaborative by its remarkable success in the education of AI ESIs and students in scientific fields. Moreover, Cherokee Nation and OSU have broken ground at Cherokee Nation on the first tribally affiliated medical school in the US. The Collaborative therefore provides an unprecedented environment in which a tribe, a university, and a research-intensive cancer center will work synergistically to reduce the unacceptable burden of cancer that continues to affect AI people.",2020-09-14T12:09:00Z,2024-08-31T12:08:00Z,PAR-18-911,nofo_PAR-18-911,CHEROKEE NATION,TAHLEQUAH,OK,UNITED STATES,pache

DLDCCC is a National Cancer Institute (NCI) designated cancer center. TSU is one of the nation’s largest Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) serving underserved populations and underrepresented students (ISUPSs). BCM and TSU have had several successful collaborations. This relationship was strengthened recently through TSU’s U54 “Center for Biomedical and Minority Health Research”, where BCM faculty have partnered closely on collaborative cancer disparities community education and outreach. This P20 program provides an excellent opportunity for TSU and BCM to expand collaborations. We propose a BCM-TSU P20 program “Collaborative Union for Cancer Research, Education and Disparities” (CURED) that will foster strong collaborations utilizing our complementary strengths. Overall objectives are to create a shared infrastructure that will provide an optimal environment for cancer research, education, community outreach, and career development and diversify the biomedical workforce. CURED was established under the direction of senior leadership at each institution, reflected in the significant institutional support for this partnership. BCM has committed $160,000/year for four years in cost matching funds, $ 50,000 for Pilot project 2 for one year, and committed funds to support the training of TSU summer students in the Cancer Research Education Program. TSU has committed to return the Indirect Cost allocation amounting to $98,000 each year. All TSU investigators are members of the DLDCCC. Leaders of each institution are thus committed to empower the P20 partnership to address cancer health disparities among URM and underserved populations in Houston. Our goals are to (1) establish a collaborative alliance between BCM and TSU for cancer research, education, and community outreach. We will (a) establish CURED offices in both institutions that will provide coordination for relevant activities, evaluate progress of current projects, and ensure a pipeline of innovative pilot projects; (b) centralize institutional resources for faculty/trainee research needs (c) lead a cancer research and career development program for TSU students that includes mentored cancer research, an educational curriculum, hands-on training in emerging technologies, and professional development; (d) build a BCM/TSU comprehensive outreach program to address cancer disparities at the bench, bedside, and within the community; and (2) to support a pipeline of collaborative innovative cancer research pilot projects. Overall Impact: We are certain that the proposed CURED will enhance cancer research education capacity at TSU, promote a diverse research workforce, and improve BCM/DLDCCC’s effectiveness in developing and sustaining research programs focused on cancer health disparities. We will develop sustainable research capacity leading to independent and collaborative applications to the NIH/other Federal/Non-federal agencies.",2023-09-21T12:09:00Z,2027-08-31T12:08:00Z,PAR-22-239,nofo_PAR-22-239,TEXAS SOUTHERN UNIVERSITY,HOUSTON,TX,UNITED STATES,pache

This relationship was strengthened recently through TSU’s U54 “Center for Biomedical and Minority Health Research”, where BCM faculty have partnered closely on collaborative cancer disparities community education and outreach. This P20 program provides an excellent opportunity for TSU and BCM to expand collaborations. We propose a BCM-TSU P20 program “Collaborative Union for Cancer Research, Education and Disparities” (CURED) that will foster strong collaborations utilizing our complementary strengths. Overall objectives are to create a shared infrastructure that will provide an optimal environment for cancer research, education, community outreach, and career development and diversify the biomedical workforce. CURED was established under the direction of senior leadership at each institution, reflected in the significant institutional support for this partnership. BCM has committed $160,000/year for four years in cost matching funds, $ 50,000 for Pilot project 2 for one year, and committed funds to support the training of TSU summer students in the Cancer Research Education Program. TSU has committed to return the Indirect Cost allocation amounting to $98,000 each year. All TSU investigators are members of the DLDCCC. Leaders of each institution are thus committed to empower the P20 partnership to address cancer health disparities among URM and underserved populations in Houston. Our goals are to (1) establish a collaborative alliance between BCM and TSU for cancer research, education, and community outreach. We will (a) establish CURED offices in both institutions that will provide coordination for relevant activities, evaluate progress of current projects, and ensure a pipeline of innovative pilot projects; (b) centralize institutional resources for faculty/trainee research needs (c) lead a cancer research and career development program for TSU students that includes mentored cancer research, an educational curriculum, hands-on training in emerging technologies, and professional development; (d) build a BCM/TSU comprehensive outreach program to address cancer disparities at the bench, bedside, and within the community; and (2) to support a pipeline of collaborative innovative cancer research pilot projects. Overall Impact: We are certain that the proposed CURED will enhance cancer research education capacity at TSU, promote a diverse research workforce, and improve BCM/DLDCCC’s effectiveness in developing and sustaining research programs focused on cancer health disparities. We will develop sustainable research capacity leading to independent and collaborative applications to the NIH/other Federal/Non-federal agencies.",2023-09-21T12:09:00Z,2027-08-31T12:08:00Z,PAR-22-239,nofo_PAR-22-239,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,HOUSTON,TX,UNITED STATES,pache
P50CA058223,SPORE in Breast Cancer,"Abstract This is the revision of the year 25-29 competitive renewal of the UNC Breast Cancer SPORE, one of the original 1992 SPOREs, which has contributed key findings in breast cancer translational research in minority disparities, genomic analysis, molecular subtyping and therapeutic resistance, while advancing new technology and developing junior faculty into translational research leaders. The constant since 1992 is a population- based, biospecimen-rich, epidemiological and clinical infrastructure, the Carolina Breast Cancer Study (CBCS). CBCS Phase 3 has finished accrual of an additional 3,000 cases and embarked on a ten-year follow- up with treatment, adherence, and outcome data. CBCS oversamples African Americans (AA) and patients aged 50 or younger to provide one of the largest population-based studies of age and race disparities. CBCS has made seminal contributions to our understanding of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and other breast cancer subtypes in North Carolina’s AA population with over 150 papers published. For example, our SPORE has published articles characterizing Basal-like TNBC that have been cited over 23,000 times. With substantial institutional investment, the UNC SPORE: i) Incorporates new technology and novel methods; ii) Develops infrastructure that provides new directions; and iii) Promotes career advancement for junior and mid-level faculty from the population, basic and clinical sciences. In the last 5 years, the CEP and DRP produced seven Komen Catalyst Awardees. The CEP brought 13 new faculty to the SPORE, 5 of them women and 3 minorities. The DRP funded collaborative projects between: engineers and clinicians to produce unique instruments and methods for early detection; immunologists and geneticists to study breast cancer immune infiltrates and responses; and outcomes researchers, clinicians and programmers to create new databases to study breast cancer care delivery in North Carolina. With EAB and Executive Committee input, the multi-PIs Chuck Perou and Shelley Earp with clinician co-lead Lisa Carey selected 4 projects for this revised renewal, focusing on minority disparities, developing a new understanding of resistance to immuno- and chemotherapies, and developing novel, clinically practical, predictive biomarkers. Project #1 – The Carolina Breast Cancer Study (Troester, PhD and Carey, MD, MSc) will explore biologic and genomic differences in AA (1500) and white (1500) tumor specimens relating those to multiple patient-level parameters. The other projects are: Project #2 Inflammatory Signaling and ER+ Breast Cancer Therapeutic Resistance (Franco, PhD, Baldwin, PhD and Dees, MD, MSc); #3 Development of Chemotherapy and Immunotherapy Biomarkers for TNBC (Perou, PhD and Carey, MD, MSc) and #4 Therapeutic Approaches to the Adaptive Chromatin Remodeling that Underlies Resistance (Johnson, PhD and Earp, MD).",1992-09-30T12:09:00Z,2024-08-31T12:08:00Z,CA94-027;PAR-00-087;PAR-05-156;PAR-10-003;PAR-14-353,award_P50CA058223,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,CHAPEL HILL,NC,UNITED STATES,spore_breast_cancer_unc

P50CA070907,Targeting Lung Cancer Vulnerabilities,"Overall SPORE Summary/Abstract Targeting Lung Cancer Vulnerabilities. The University of Texas SPORE in Lung Cancer represents a unique collaboration between the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center (UTSW) and the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC), both of which have outstanding strengths in lung cancer translational and clinical research. The overarching goal of the SPORE is to develop new therapeutic paradigms based on recently identified “vulnerabilities” acquired during lung cancer pathogenesis, including a molecular understanding of lung cancers in individual patients, and using this information to “personalize” therapy for each lung cancer patient. Thus, our strategy is to identify lung cancer “therapeutic quartets” which include: 1. a specific vulnerability; 2. the mechanism of action thus defining therapeutic target(s) for the vulnerability; 3. a deliverable treatment for the target(s); and 4. tumor molecular biomarkers for the vulnerability predicting specific therapies for each patient. The UT Lung Cancer SPORE builds on a 20-year productive history, incorporating recent advances made by our SPORE investigators and the rest of the lung cancer translational research community in the molecular and mechanistic understanding of tumor autonomous and microenvironment changes, acquired vulnerabilities, and important immuno-oncology effects. These advances include novel approaches to identifying and molecularly classifying vulnerabilities in lung cancer metabolomic changes, cancers immunologically “inert” to PD1/PD-L1 checkpoint blockade, the lung cancer fibrotic stroma (microenvironment), and tumorigenesis-induced replication stress. Our contributions also include preclinical human and mouse model systems for testing the different vulnerabilities, as well as large legacy molecular and clinically annotated preclinical model and clinical specimen datasets. The SPORE is composed of 4 projects, all of which have Human Endpoints: 1. Targeting metabolic vulnerabilities in lung cancer; 2. Targeting vulnerabilities in immunologically-inert lung cancer; 3. Targeting vulnerabilities in the fibrotic extracellular matrix (ECM) of lung cancers; and 4. Therapeutic targeting of oncogene-induced replication stress for tumor cell killing and anti-tumor immunity in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) (which includes a clinical trial targeting replication stress combined with immune checkpoint inhibtion. There are three cores: A. Administrative (including patient advocates); B. Molecular Pathology and Tissue Resources; and C. Data Sciences, as well as strong Developmental Research and Career Enhancement Programs (DRP, CEP). Our SPORE features leading lung cancer multi-disciplinary clinical and laboratory scientists, a cadre of experienced patient advocates, and an outstanding publication record. Moving forward, this SPORE will provide information on newly identified lung cancer acquired vulnerabilities, biomarkers for personalizing individual patient therapy, and important preclinical and information to facilitate clinical translation that has the possibility of changing the face of lung cancer therapy.",1996-09-30T12:09:00Z,2025-08-31T12:08:00Z,PA-21-071;PAR-01-110;PAR-06-505;PAR-12-296;PAR-18-313,award_P50CA070907,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,DALLAS,TX,UNITED STATES,spore_lung_cancer_texas
P50CA097257,Brain Tumor SPORE Grant,"Project Summary/Abstract This SPORE renewal application represents the efforts of interdisciplinary teams of investigators from the Neuro- Oncology Program of the UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center (HDFCCC) to build on our accomplishments to continue to translate our findings to improve care for patients with brain cancer. We have three specific objectives: (1) to develop novel peripheral blood-based biomarkers for glioma patients, (2) to identify novel metabolic markers for noninvasive imaging to evaluate tumor burden and treatment response, and (3) to develop a novel immunotherapy strategy to overcome the current significant challenges. At the heart of the proposal are three translational research projects—each intended to evaluate paradigm-changing novel tools for prognostic, diagnostic, and therapeutic modalities with defined human endpoints. Project 1 will build on the team’s pioneering work during the current funding cycle that they established as immunomethylomics. The team identified GBM survival to be independently predicted by an interactive model of age and peripheral blood immune profiles, a methylation biomarker of myeloid-derived suppressor cells, or a methylation biomarker of dexamethasone response. Using prospectively collected >1,800 samples from the current cycle and additional samples from the new cycle, the team plans to create blood DNA methylation-based biomarkers for integrated GBM prognosis models, stratification of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-wild type vs. mutant gliomas, and assessments of treatment response. Project 2 team will also build on their achievements during the current funding cycle related to the development of hyperpolarized C-13 imaging as novel imaging markers of response. In the current proposal, the team will evaluate their central hypothesis that the use of hyperpolarized C-13 (HP) imaging probes (HP [2-13C]pyruvate or [1-13C]α-ketoglutarate [α-KG]) in magnetic resonance (MR) imaging will serve as metabolic markers of treatment response and tumor burden in patients with IDH-mutant glioma. The team will first evaluate their hypothesis in preclinical models and the roles of HP [2-13C ] pyruvate and HP [1- 13C]⍺-KG probes in the treatment response and tumor burden, respectively, in patients. Project 3 will develop the first-in-human phase I trial of adoptive transfer therapy using autologous T lymphocytes that are genetically engineered with a novel “prime and kill” gene circuit. Based on preclinical data, this approach will allow us to overcome significant challenges for developing effective immunotherapy for GBM, such as antigen- heterogeneity, on-target off-tumor toxicities, exhaustion, and the lack of effective GBM-homing of the therapeutic T lymphocytes. This SPORE proposal also requests continued support for the Career Enhancement and Developmental Research Programs and for three Cores (Administrative, Biospecimen/Pathology, and Biostatistics and Clinical) that will support the efforts of the three projects.

The overall goal of the Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center (VICC) SPORE in Breast Cancer is to conduct collaborative, multidisciplinary and mechanism-based translational research that will have the highest possible impact for women and men with or at risk for breast cancer. This project for the Administrative Supplement for NCI Global Oncology Mentored Research will assess response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer in patients undergoing breast cancer treatment in Kijabe, Kenya through a formal mentored research relationship between researchers at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and a faculty member (a medical oncologist/radiation oncologist) at AIC Kijabe Hospital. Dr. Christine Mwakio (medical/radiation oncology) is an early-career low-middle income country researcher (ESLI) who is actively involved in the care of breast cancer patients in Kenya. She proposes a two-part study. First, she will evaluate the clinical response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and the relationship between response to therapy and patient demographics, tumor characteristics, social determinants of health and treatment regimen in patients diagnosed with breast cancer at Kijabe Hospital. Second, she will compare the molecular subtypes of breast cancer with response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, correlating with residual cancer burden score in Kijabe, Kenya. Funds from this subcontract will support the salary of the ESLI, two research assistants, laptops for the research assistants to complete this project, funds to perform immunohistochemistry analysis on both breast biopsy specimens and surgical breast specimens, and use of public transportation for patients in the study to return to Kijabe, Kenya for follow-up.

P50CA101942,DF/HCC Kidney Cancer SPORE,"Summary This application represents a resubmission of a competing renewal application for a Specialized Program of Research Excellence (SPORE) in Kidney Cancer from the Kidney Cancer Program of Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center (DF/HCC). The DF/HCC Kidney Cancer SPORE has been funded for two cycles since 2003. DF/HCC is comprised of the following institutions: Beth Israel-Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC); Dana- Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI); Harvard Medical School; Harvard School of Public Health; Brigham and Women’s Hospital; Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH); and Children’s Hospital of Boston. In addition to the institutions in the DF/HCC, the Georgetown-Lombardi Cancer Center (GLCC) is collaborating institutions in this grant. The DF/HCC Kidney Cancer SPORE has its administrative base at the BIDMC. Dr. David McDermott, who has led the DF/HCC Kidney Cancer Program and SPORE since 2012 is joined as SPORE Director by Dr. William Kaelin, a laboratory scientist at DFCI and has served with Dr. McDermott as Director of the SPORE since early 2014. Dr. Kaelin is a world renowned basic and translational investigator with longstanding interest in renal cancer and a leader within the DF/HCC community. Drs. McDermott and Kaelin report directly to Dr. Laurie Glimcher, Director of DF/HCC and President of DFCI. The DF/HCC Kidney Cancer SPORE has a broad and deep talent base and there is extensive institutional commitment. We take advantage of a large patient population and cutting edge technologies that are available to us as part of DF/HCC. We propose 3 Projects which address critical problems in kidney cancer and have translational components. They focus on identifying effective strategies for targeting: HIF2α, the dominant oncogenic driver of clear-cell RCC (Project 1), resistance mechanisms of standard therapies (Projects 2-3, DRP 17), novel immune checkpoint pathways (Project 3) and rare kidney tumor types (e.g. NF2 mutated and translocation RCC, DRP 18 and 17). The projects are supported by three Cores - an Administrative Core, a Biostatistics and Computational Biology Core, and a Tissue Acquisition, Pathology and Clinical Data Core. We also have a highly successful Career Development Program that selects talented physician scientists and mentors them to independence as well as a Developmental Projects Program that generates new ideas for the SPORE in the future. The existence of the SPORE has provided opportunities and incentives to extend basic science and clinical research ideas into the translational realm and facilitated the entry of young, as well as some seasoned, investigators into the kidney cancer field where they have made major contributions.",2003-09-18T12:09:00Z,2025-08-31T12:08:00Z,PAR-01-110;PAR-08-020;PAR-14-031;PAR-18-313,award_P50CA101942,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,BOSTON,MA,UNITED STATES,spore_kidney_cancer_df_hcc
P50CA107399,City of Hope Lymphoma SPORE,"The overall goal of the City of Hope Lymphoma SPORE is to develop novel therapeutics and prognostics representing the forefront of knowledge gained from observations in molecular biology and cellular immunology at City of Hope. Six clinical trials are proposed, five of which utilize agents (cellular products, small molecules, radiolabeled antibodies) that have been produced at City of Hope and are developed from our preclinical laboratory studies. In Project 1, we have engineered bi-specific chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells that respond to both lymphoma antigen and cytomegalovirus (CMV) antigen. Combining bi-specific CAR T cells with a CMV vaccine developed at City of Hope may enhance CAR T cell persistence and allow in vivo control of T cells in patients with relapsed/refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) in three clinical settings: 1) lymphodepleting chemotherapy, 2) autologous (auto) hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), and 3) allogeneic HCT. Project 2 builds on our previous observations in a prospective longitudinal study of lymphoma patients undergoing auto HCT, revealing pathogenic mutations contributing to a predictive 38-gene signature of susceptibility to tMDS/AML. We will now use this City of Hope cohort and an external validation cohort to develop a comprehensive risk prediction model for developing t-MDS/AML after auto HCT. Project 3 addresses the poor outcomes for patients with relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma with two phase II clinical trials: a PET-adapted strategy using PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab ± ICE chemotherapy as a bridge to autologous HCT, and aTac-BEAM, a radioimmunotherapy-based augmented autologous HCT regimen. In Project 4, we propose a clinical trial of a novel agent linking a CpG oligonucleotide with anti-sense STAT3 siRNA to target NHL and associated immune cells. We are also developing a modified high-affinity STAT3-DNA binding sequence linked to a CpG oligonucleotide that inhibits STAT3 by acting as DNA decoy. The SPORE, also supports a Career Enhancement Program for researchers new to lymphoma research, as well as a Developmental Research Program for scientists with promising pilot projects. SPORE cores provide crucial support to the success of the projects: The Administrative Core (Core A) provides organizational and programmatic support; the Biostatistics and Research Informatics Core (Core B) imparts comprehensive statistical and information management expertise; and Biospecimen Core (Core C) supports projects as they relate to sample collection, processing, storage and distribution. The GMP Manufacturing Core (Core D) is responsible for process development, regulatory support, and cGMP-compliant clinical grade production of novel investigational agents; this core is an invaluable resource allowing us to rapidly translate laboratory discoveries to the clinic. Lastly, with a richly diverse catchment area, City of Hope has made a coordinated effort to engage patients that have been traditionally underrepresented and underserved in clinical trials. In sum, this SPORE holds high potential to make significant inroads in improving outcomes for lymphoma patients.",2004-09-02T12:09:00Z,2024-08-31T12:08:00Z,PA-18-591;PAR-02-126;PAR-14-353,award_P50CA107399,BECKMAN RESEARCH INSTITUTE/CITY OF HOPE,DUARTE,CA,UNITED STATES,spore_lymphoma
P50CA127001,SPORE in Brain Cancer,"SUMMARY: OVERALL The overarching goal of this Brain Cancer SPORE renewal application is to improve the notoriously poor outcome of patients with glioblastoma (GBM). This goal will be achieved through the development of a multidisciplinary and highly translational research program that seeks to discover and rapidly translate novel and mechanistically diverse treatment strategies, including biological, immunological and targeted strategies, and by developing prognostic and predictive biomarkers that inform individualized approaches to GBM treatment, while also exploring pathogenesis and risk through genetic-based epidemiological studies in minority populations. By pursuing the strategies of this research program, all projects in the current funding period (2013-18) have successfully transitioned from the bench to clinical trials, including testing of a novel oncolytic virus, Delta-24- RGD, in multiple clinical trials; completing a biological-endpoint Phase II clinical trial of a PI3K-targeted agent, BKM-120; meeting IND requirements for a first-in-human trial of a new immune-modulatory p-STAT-3 inhibitor, WP1066; and validating prognostic biomarkers in clinical trial datasets, while also testing a molecular predictor of radiation sensitivity. In this renewal application we propose three translational research projects that organically evolved from the successes of our current SPORE, and which are supported by four mission-critical Cores (Administrative, Pathology/Biorepository, Biostatistics/ Bioinformatics, Animal). Our Developmental Research Program (DRP) and Career Enhancement Program (CEP) continue as incubators of new projects and portals for new investigators. The aims of our projects are: Project 1: Exploit the capacity of Delta-24-RGD to activate anti-glioma immunity by completing a clinical trial combining Delta-24-RGD with Pembrolizumab, and by testing next-generation Delta-24-RGD viruses that are armed with immune stimulatory molecules: OX40L, GITRL, and 4-1BBL, while analyzing anti-Ad5 antibodies as a biomarker in response to therapy. Project 2: Attack metabolic vulnerabilities of GBMs through the development and clinical testing of a novel inhibitor of oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos), IACS-010759, that efficiently kills GBMs harboring genetic or epigenetic mutations that impair glycolysis (e.g. ENO1 deletions), and by evaluating a new hypoxia-responsive PET probe, 18F-FAZA, as a readout of OxPhos inhibition and target engagement of IACS-010759. Project 3: Decipher germline and somatic genomic landscape of gliomas in Black and Hispanic minority populations, whose prognosis and survival differ than GBM patients of White European descent. Germline SNP data will be combined with extensive molecular profiling in case-matched tumors.

P50CA127003,Dana Farber/ Harvard Cancer Center SPORE in Gastrointestinal Cancer,"Project Summary This is a competitive renewal application for a SPORE in Gastrointestinal (GI) Cancers originating from the GI Malignancies Program of the Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center (DF/HCC). Since its inception in 2007, the SPORE has established a thriving culture of inter-institutional collaboration that has united basic, clinical, and population scientists into a highly productive translational enterprise. The ability to attract and retain researchers from diverse disciplines has fostered fundamental discoveries in cancer biology, innovative translational hypotheses, and cutting-edge clinical trials. The SPORE has also maintained a central focus on developing a large cadre of new investigators, building on a successful model of interdisciplinary, cross- campus cooperation that serves as a nidus for inter-SPORE relationships and other collaborations. Moreover, the SPORE has created invaluable research resources, such as the Tissue, PDX and Organoid Repository and clinical, pathology, and genomics databases that collectively accelerate translational investigation. Each of the current projects has achieved or exceeded its translational goals, providing a foundation for programmatic studies, including independent large-scale collaborative initiatives. Building on this progress, the DF/HCC GI SPORE seeks to continue to translate biological and technological advances into improvements in the prevention and treatment of GI malignancies. The overarching objectives of a renewed SPORE are to: 1) Define optimal genomic and functional strategies, including integration of cell-free (cf)DNA profiling (Projects 1-4), to predict drug responsiveness and improve diagnostics, prognostics, and clinical decisions. 2) Elucidate the interplay between oncogenic mutations, targeted therapy, and anti-tumor immunity to inform cancer biology and improve the outcome of patients with GI cancers (Projects 1,3, 4). 3) Define mechanisms of resistance to novel targeted therapies and hence identify new approaches to overcome resistance and better select the patients most likely to respond to therapy (Projects 1-4). 4) Enhance study of deadly GI cancers that, despite rising incidence, remain under- studied (Project 2, 4). 5) Encourage collaboration and promote academic rigor by providing clinical specimens, fostering core technologies and resources, and hosting regular research meetings and seminars focused on GI cancers. 6) Provide mentorship and training for young GI cancer researchers and recruit leading translational investigators from other fields through Career Enhancement and Developmental Project Awards.",2007-04-01T12:04:00Z,2024-05-31T12:05:00Z,PAR-05-156;PAR-10-003;PAR-18-313,award_P50CA127003,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,BOSTON,MA,UNITED STATES,spore_gastrointestinal
P50CA165962,SPORE: Targeted Therapies for Glioma,"This is the competing renewal of a SPORE initiative on glioma at Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center. Our objective is to improve the standard of care for children, young adults, and adults with these tumors through the use of targeted therapies. Towards this end, basic scientists from Harvard Medical School and the Broad Institute join with clinical/translational investigators from Boston Children’s Hospital, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Massachusetts General Hospital. There are four projects: Project One targets pediatric low-grade astrocytomas (PLGAs). Nearly 75% of PLGAs are driven by activating mutations in the BRAF protein kinase. Clinician/scientists Daphne Haas-Kogan, M.D. and Karen Wright, M.D. together with structural biologist Michael Eck, M.D., Ph.D. will develop and test brain-penetrant targeted therapeutics for BRAF-mutant PLGAs. Project Two targets IDH-mutant gliomas which present typically in young adults. IDH-mutant gliomas produce extraordinarily high levels of the ‘oncometabolite’ R-2- hydroxyglutarate (2-HG). However, therapeutic exploitation of the differential 2-HG content between normal and malignant brain tissue has yet to be realized. Neurosurgeon Daniel Cahill, M.D., Ph.D. and cancer biologist William Kaelin, M.D. will address this therapeutic lacuna. Project Three targets adult gliomas. Recent studies by basic scientist Jean Zhao, Ph.D. show that in addition to suppressing cell cycle progression, CDK4/6 antagonists promote anti-tumor immunity and synergistically enhance the response to checkpoint inhibitors. Going forward, Dr. Zhao together with neuro-oncologist Patrick Wen, M.D. will test the hypothesis that brain penetrant CDK4/6 inhibitors can augment immunotherapeutic approaches to GBM. Project Four targets the neuronal microenvironment of adult and pediatric gliomas. Neuro-oncologist and developmental neurobiologist Michelle Monje, M.D., Ph.D. has shown that neurons promote glioma growth through activity- regulated secretion of neuroligin-3 (NLGN3) into the tumor microenvironment. Basic scientist Mario Suva, M.D, Ph.D. has refined methods for single cell sequencing of the multiple cell types within the microenvironment of freshly resected human gliomas. Working together, Monje and Suva will define the molecular mechanisms whereby microenvironmental NLGN3 modulates formation and progression of gliomas and explore a novel therapeutic opportunity embedded within the NLGN3 requirement. Rigor and reproducibility of work conducted in the four projects will be fostered by cores for Pathology and for Biostatistics and Computational Biology. An Administration core will enable and manage the multiple consortium agreements and collaborative interactions between Harvard Medical School, the four participating Harvard teaching hospitals and facilitate clinical trials and imaging studies. Intellectual vigor within the program is sustained and refreshed by annual Career Enhancement Awards to young investigators and by annual Developmental Project Awards.",2013-09-19T12:09:00Z,2024-08-31T12:08:00Z,PA-18-906;PA-21-071;PAR-10-003;PAR-18-313,award_P50CA165962,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,BOSTON,MA,UNITED STATES,spore_targeted_therapies_for_glioma
P50CA168504,Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center SPORE in Breast Cancer,"PROJECT SUMMARY The Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center (DF/HCC) SPORE in Breast Cancer seeks to improve the understanding and treatment of breast cancer using an innovative and highly translational approach. The application consists of four projects, three cores, a developmental research program (DRP) and a career enhancement programs (CEP). Each project addresses a fundamental challenge that results in premature mortality or substantial morbidity. Project 1 brings together outstanding investigators to study mechanisms of resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitors. In estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer, we hypothesize that CDK2 hyperactivation is a cause of acquired resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitors. Elegant preclinical work will be complemented by a clinical study in which paired biopsies are obtained prior to initiation of CDK4/6 inhibitors and when resistance develops. In triple-negative breast cancer, we will evaluate the possibility that lysosomal sequestration of CDK4/6 inhibitors limits their therapeutic efficacy. In preclinical work, we will determine if this sequestration can be reversed administering chloroquine and will also conduct a trial of palbociclib/chloroquine in RB-intact triple-negative disease. Project 2 uses two “co-clinical” trials – running randomized human trials and mouse experiments largely in parallel – to study two novel therapeutic approaches to enhance the anti- tumor immune response against HER2-positive breast cancers (CDK4/6 inhibition and dual PDL1 and 4-1BB targeting). Both approaches are based on our compelling preclinical data, and will include local and international collaborators. Project 3 tackles the challenge of breast cancer brain metastases. Leveraging our unique collection of xenografts derived from resected human brain metastases, and our experience conducting brain metastasis-specific trials, we will test the biologic and clinical impact of two novel systemic therapy regimens. Project 4 is focused on triple-negative breast cancer. We will perform comprehensive preclinical studies and clinical trials to determine whether targeted therapies can sensitize triple-negative tumors to immunotherapy. We will evaluate combinations of either PARP inhibitors or BET bromodomain inhibitors with immune checkpoint blockade. Core A, the Administrative Core, is the epicenter of scientific, fiscal and administrative oversight. It will lead efforts in planning and communication, and also houses the Patient Advocacy Committee. Core A will ensure that existing DF/HCC structures support the SPORE clinical research efforts. Core B, the Biostatistics and Computational Biology core, provides specialized expertise in biostatistics and management of genomic data. Core C, the Biospecimen and Pathology Core, will maintain tissue/blood repositories for the SPORE projects and for investigators outside of the SPORE. It also provides critical pathology services for the projects and will perform cutting edge assays. Core C also houses the Immuno-Oncology Sub Core.

The goal of the YSILC is to reduce mortality from lung cancer through development of novel therapeutics and treatment approaches that are based on an understanding of targetable biochemical and immunological pathways involved in progression of lung cancer, acquisition of resistance, and development of metastasis The YSILC translational research team will accomplish this objective through three projects: Project 1: Test the hypotheses that Siglec-15 (S15) is a major immune suppressor in PD-L1/B7-H1-negative lung cancer and that blockade of S15 can be efficacious for a subset of lung cancer patients; Project 2: Evaluate mechanism-based approaches to counter tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance in EGFR-mutant lung cancer; Project 3: Targeting lung cancer metastasis and drug resistance in the central nervous system. There are three Cores (Administrative; Biostatistics and Bioinformatics; and Biospecimen, Pathology, and Genomics) to support the projects and their clinical aims, mechanistic studies, and evaluation of biomarkers for clinical application. Strong Developmental Research and Career Enhancement Programs (DRP, CEP) with a history of choosing diverse and productive projects with good outcomes are also proposed. The highly coordinated YSILC projects, cores, and programs are focused on developing novel lung cancer therapies, with analysis of patient samples, cell-based assays, production of human cell lines and animal models of disease as a guide to design prospective trials that translate these innovative targeted approaches to clinical therapies. Each of these projects has a clinical trial (either investigator-initiated or NCI-based) designed to test the sensitivity and resistance of the new therapy with molecular correlates. The expected translational outcomes of the program include: (1) a highly coordinated and focused development of a novel immune agent discovered during our current SPORE research; (2) an improved understanding of genetic and epigenetic mechanisms of resistance to EGFR therapies and how to combat it; (3) an understanding of the mechanism underlying brain metastasis; (4) expanding the breadth of lung cancer research by developing the next generation of investigators and encouraging established investigators in other fields to pursue studies on lung cancer through our CEP and DRP programs.",2015-08-26T12:08:00Z,2025-07-31T12:07:00Z,PAR-14-031;PAR-18-313;RFA-CA-16-012,award_P50CA196530,YALE UNIVERSITY,NEW HAVEN,CT,UNITED STATES,spore_in_lung_cancer_yale
P50CA206963,SPORE in Myeloid Malignancies,"Overall Abstract The overall goal of this SPORE in Myeloid Malignancies is to take advantage of our increased understanding of the genetic and molecular basis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) to develop novel, effective therapeutic strategies for patients with these treatment-resistant neoplasms. The extensive scientific and clinical resources at the Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center (DF/HCC) will be leveraged – marshaling local expertise in cell and molecular biology, genetics, immunology, biostatistics, chemistry, murine models, and clinical trial development – in order to perform innovative pre-clinical studies, to validate novel drug targets in patient cells, and to design and implement clinical trials that will eventually lead to improved outcomes for patients with myeloid malignancies. Each of the four Projects will promote detailed analysis of a promising new target by a combination of pre-clinical studies to optimize therapeutic development and early-stage clinical trials. Project 1 leverages recent exciting data from the laboratory of Dr. Scott Armstrong regarding the efficacy of targeting the MLL-menin interaction, which is essential for maintaining HOXA expression and maintenance of leukemia stem cells. Project 2 is based on the discovery by the Stegmaier laboratory that many cases of AML are dependent on SYK kinase activation, and that SYK activation causes chemotherapy resistance. Project 3 will examine the pre-clinical and clinical efficacy of a novel SF3B1 inhibitor, using an Sf3b1-mutant model developed by the Ebert laboratory, for the treatment MDS. Project 4 will examine the potential synergy of a highly effective vaccine with a potent immunologic checkpoint inhibitor for the treatment of AML. The Cores have been designed to support all projects in translational research. The laboratory and clinical research components of each project will interface with Core 1 for statistical guidance in both experimental design and the interpretation of results. Core 2 will provide biospecimens banking for the samples produced by all projects in the course of clinical trials; these samples will be used for the generation of primagrafts in immunodeficient mice. Samples from the biospecimens bank as well as xenograft samples will, in turn, be available for use by the PI's of all projects. Core 3 will work with the clinical trials in each project for correlative studies. Ultimately, the proposed studies promise to improve the therapy of chemotherapy-resistant AML and splicing factor-mutant MDS, as well as developing an improved immunotherapeutic strategy for AML.",2017-09-19T12:09:00Z,2023-07-31T12:07:00Z,PAR-14-353,award_P50CA206963,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,BOSTON,MA,UNITED STATES,spore_in_myeloid_malignancies

P50CA217674,The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center SPORE in Hepatocellular Carcinoma,"Overall - SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The overall goal of the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center SPORE in Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) is to improve outcomes for HCC patients and reduce the mortality rates of HCC through early intervention. HCC is the 2nd leading cause of cancer death worldwide with 854,000 new cases diagnosed globally and 810,000 deaths in 2015. The incidence of new HCC cases globally is projected to rise to 1,341,344 cases by 2035. In the United States (U.S.), while death rates declined for all cancers combined and for most cancer sites in the past 10 years, deaths from HCC increased at the highest rate of all cancer sites, and HCC incidence rates increased sharply, second only to thyroid cancer. The burden of HCC is not equally distributed throughout the U.S., the highest incidence being observed in States on the Mexico-US Border. Texas ranks second in incidence of HCC, with a 5-year rate of 11.4 cases per 100,000 compared to the nation rate of 7.6. Within Texas, Hispanics in counties bordering Mexico have the highest rates of HCC in the U.S., with 37.5 diagnosed cases per 100,000. Reflecting the rising incidence trends, the number of HCC patients seeking care at MD Anderson Cancer Center has increased every year, from 277 patients in 2013 to 580 patients in 2017, a 2-fold increase over the most recent 5 years. The relative 5-year survival rate for HCC is 16%. The poor prognosis of HCC is due to multiple factors: 1) the vast majority of HCC cases are diagnosed at an advanced stage, not amenable to curative surgical treatment (resection or liver transplantation); 2) even resected cases suffer from high rates of recurrence (up to 50% in 2 years and 70% in 5 years); 3) HCC often occurs in the context of advanced chronic liver disease, cirrhosis in particular, limiting treatment options; 4) the only FDA-approved first line systemic therapy is sorafenib which offers a 2.8 months improvement in overall survival and a dismal response rate of 2%; and 5) the recently approved second line therapy are another tyrosine kinase inhibitor regorafenib and the immunotherapy drug nivolumab, but again improvement in overall survival and response rates are very low. In this SPORE application, 3 projects together with 3 cores will: 1) evaluate the effect of checkpoint therapy in neoadjuvant and adjuvant HCC settings and determine optimal combinations with checkpoint therapeutics to enhance the anti-tumor immune response; 2) determine the prognostic significance of phosphorylated STAT3 as a biomarker for postoperative recurrence and evaluate TTI-101 (C188-9), a STAT3 inhibitor developed in-house, as a post-operative adjuvant; 3) evaluate the combination of nivolumab and TTI-101 in the treatment of patients with advanced stage HCC; 4) perform extensive screening for liver fibrosis in obese and diabetic Hispanics in South Texas, and identify non-invasive biomarkers of fibrosis stage and progression in this underserved population highly affected by non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and HCC.",2019-09-25T12:09:00Z,2024-08-31T12:08:00Z,PAR-18-313,award_P50CA217674,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,HOUSTON,TX,UNITED STATES,spore_in_hepatocellular_carcinoma

It is often diagnosed at an advanced stage and is associated with poor outcomes for the majority of patients. This application for a lung cancer SPORE award from Emory University brings together an outstanding and multi- disciplinary team of oncologists, immunologists, drug discovery experts, and translational researchers dedicated to lung cancer research to address critical questions that will improve the outcome for patients with this lethal disease. Our proposed program will have significant impact in two crucial areas of lung cancer management: enhancing the efficacy of immunotherapy and overcoming treatment resistance through the development of novel molecularly targeted agents. Through strong teamwork carried out by this highly collaborative team of dedicated investigators, and building on exciting data published in leading journals by our group since our previous SPORE application, this revised submission aims to achieve substantial improvements in the management of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), through three overall Specific Aims: Aim 1: To evaluate stem-like T cells and improve efficacy of checkpoint inhibitors in NSCLC (Project 1); Aim 2: To target MERTK to improve outcomes for EGFR-mutated NSCLC (Project 2); and Aim 3: To target Bax signaling to overcome treatment resistance in NSCLC (Project 3). The Emory Lung Cancer SPORE program will be supported by close interaction with the Administrative Core (Core 1), Pathology Core (Core 2) and the Biostatistics and Biomedical Informatics Core (Core 3), and will conduct Career Enhancement and Developmental Research Programs (CEP and DRP). The SPORE program will benefit from regular advice and recommendations from External and Internal Advisory Board members regarding its progress and direction.

P50CA221707,MD Anderson Cancer Center SPORE in Gastrointestinal Cancer,"OVERALL: Summary/Abstract The overall goal of the MD Anderson SPORE in Gastrointestinal Cancer is to reduce mortality and morbidity rates from colorectal cancer (CRC) and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), and to improve the quality of life of patients afflicted by these diseases. CRC is the 2nd most common cause of cancer-related deaths in this country, while PDAC is the 3rd most common cause, underscoring the significance of the work undertaken in this proposal. Our multidisciplinary team will conduct highly innovative translational research including first-in-human trials in order to further therapeutic options available to CRC and PDAC patients. The GI SPORE will be jointly led by Scott Kopetz and Anirban Maitra, who are accomplished translational researchers in CRC and PDAC, respectively. We propose the following three projects: Project 1 will test the efficacy of a novel personalized peptide vaccine in the adjuvant setting in post-resection CRC patients, and also evaluate in preclinical models the most optimal combination therapies for vaccination in this disease. Project 1 will be a collaboration with Johns Hopkins University, and represents the confluence of our shared expertise in cancer immunotherapy and immune correlatives. Project 2 will evaluate the role of oncogenic STAT3 signaling in chronic inflammation-associated and hereditary CRC, using a combination of genetically engineered animal models and patient-derived organoids (PDOs). In addition, this project will conduct a prevention study with an internally-developed STAT3 inhibitor. Project 3 will evaluate biological correlates of response and resistance (including metabolic imaging studies) to a novel inhibitor of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in PDAC, using our substantial repertoire of genetically annotated patient-derived xenografts (PDXs). Further, we will evaluate this OXPHOS inhibitor, IACS-10759, in two clinical trials targeting metastatic and locally advanced PDAC patients, respectively, with accompanying novel imaging and molecular correlatives. An important objective of our program will be the recruiting of women and minorities to the field and mentoring of early career faculty through the Career Enhancement Program (CEP), and funding of innovative pilot projects through the Developmental Research Program (DRP). An Administrative Core designed to maintain fiscal responsibility along with reporting and institutional compliance will support all three projects. A Biospecimen and Pathology Core will support all clinical and research biospecimen needs for the three projects and a Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Core will provide support for trial design and biostatistics. Established working relationships have been extremely productive on many fronts from a well-positioned team approach.

P50CA221745,SPORE in Bladder Cancer,"Project Summary/Abstract There is palpable excitement in the oncology community that we are on the cusp of a major advance in how we treat bladder (urothelial) cancer. Recent efforts to comprehensively define the landscape of genetic alterations in urothelial cancer and to understand their impact on drug sensitivity, as well as the exciting early results with immune targeting strategies suggest that prospective molecular profiling of blood and tumor tissue could improve the outcomes of urothelial cancer patients by personalizing care. This MSK SPORE in Bladder Cancer seeks to leverage recently initiated multicenter efforts to explore the molecular basis of inherited genetic susceptibility, exploit prospective molecular characterization to guide treatment, and to test the efficacy of immunotherapy-based combination approaches. The overall translational aims of the MSK SPORE in Bladder Cancer are to 1) develop predictive biomarkers of response and resistance to immunotherapy, chemotherapy, and investigational treatments; 2) identify germline genetic alterations that confer increased risk for the development of urothelial cancer; and 3) identify mechanisms of immunotherapy resistance and develop combinatorial strategies to enhance immunotherapy response in patients with urothelial cancer. To pursue these aims, we have assembled a multidisciplinary team with complementary expertise in the clinical management of urothelial cancer, inheritable risk, mycobacterial and cancer biology, cancer genetics, molecular pathology, biostatistics, computational biology, and multiplatform data integration. The translational aims of this SPORE will be pursued through four projects, each of which addresses a different clinical state in the evolution of the disease. Project 1 will use prospective molecular characterization to determine, in the context of a cooperative group trial, whether transurethral resection and chemotherapy, without the need for cystectomy, is curative in patients with DNA damage response gene alterations and to identify novel biomarkers of chemotherapy sensitivity. Project 2 will identify and functionally characterize novel germline variants that confer increased inherited susceptibility. Project 3 will seek to identify and validate tumor- and blood-based predictive biomarkers of response to systemic immune checkpoint blockade in patients with metastatic urothelial cancer in the context of a randomized, multicenter trial. Project 4 will seek to identify predictive biomarkers of Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) response and BCG strains with greater activity as a prelude to future clinical trials. Each of these projects will be supported by the Biospecimen Repository and the Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Core, which will assist with the preparation and analysis of human tissues and genomic, immune, and clinical data, and an Administrative Core will ensure project integration. Finally, developmental research projects and career mentorship are fully integrated into the SPORE to ensure that a future generation of researchers is prepared to further advance our long-term objectives of enhancing therapy, reducing the morbidity of treatments, and ultimately eliminating this disease as a cause of premature death.",2018-08-24T12:08:00Z,2024-07-31T12:07:00Z,PAR-14-353,award_P50CA221745,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,NEW YORK,NY,UNITED STATES,spore_in_bladder_cancer
P50CA221747,SPORE for Translational Approaches to Brain Cancer,"OVERALL: SUMMARY The overall objective of the Northwestern Brain Tumor SPORE is to improve outcomes for brain tumor patients. Of the various primary intracerebral neoplasms, glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common. GBM patients that receive standard-of-care treatment have a median survival of 20 months, and 5-year survival is extremely rare. Progress in developing better treatments for this lethal tumor has been disappointing. A major contributor to this lack of therapeutic improvement is the delicate nature of the organ in which this cancer occurs. There are significant limitations to how aggressively GBM patients can be treated surgically, and the efficacy of systemically administered therapies are often compromised due to limited access to the brain. To address the public health problem that is associated with glioblastoma, we have assembled a talented team of investigators with extensive backgrounds in brain tumor research and therapy. All members of this team have professional records indicating success in directing their own programs of research. Together, these faculty initiated group interactions in order to bring a team science approach to bear upon the study and treatment of GBM, and for which a multidisciplinary approach is needed for achieving meaningful progress.",2018-08-17T12:08:00Z,2028-07-31T12:07:00Z,PAR-14-353;PAR-20-305,award_P50CA221747,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,CHICAGO,IL,UNITED STATES,spore_brain_cancer_northwestern

We emphasize intra- SPORE collaborations and development of clinical trials with companion biomarkers. Through this SPORE application, we have tried to address several of the most urgent questions in ovarian cancer therapy. First, PARP inhibitors are a new and essential feature of high grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC) therapy, but many patients eventually have cancer progression on these agents. Accordingly, in Project 1, we have designed clinical trials with drug combinations and correlative studies which will allow us to systematically extend the use of PARP inhibitors. Second, we recognize the emerging impact of immunotherapy on solid tumor treatment. Thus, in Project 2, we have designed a novel vaccine trial for ovarian cancer patients. Third, HGSC patients with primary refractory disease or those patients with recurrence whose cancer harbor underlying RAS mutations such as low grade serous or mucinous cancers pose a particularly difficult clinical problem. Accordingly, in Project 3, we will explore novel non-platinum drug combinations, such as the combination of a BCL inhibitor and a MEK inhibitor, and will examine predictive biomarkers and tumor responses evident in the extracellular activity. The Specific Aims of this DF/HCC ovarian cancer SPORE are as follows: Aim 1 (Project 1): ATR inhibitor-mediated reversal of PARP inhibitor resistance in high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC); Aim 2 (Project 2): Combined personal neoantigen-targeting cancer vaccines with immune checkpoint blockade for ovarian cancer; Aim 3 (Project 3): Evaluation of the Efficacy of Trametinib + Navitoclax in recurrent ovarian carcinoma.",2020-08-03T12:08:00Z,2025-07-31T12:07:00Z,PAR-18-313,award_P50CA240243,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,BOSTON,MA,UNITED STATES,spore_ovarian_cancer_df_hcc
P50CA244289,Building Research in Implementation and Dissemination to close Gaps and achieve Equity in Cancer Control (BRIDGE-C2) Center,"OVERALL PROJECT SUMMARY The Building Research in Implementation and Dissemination to close Gaps and achieve Equity in Cancer Control (BRIDGE-C2) Center will take on the grand challenge of advancing implementation science to improve cancer screening and prevention in underserved populations. This work is urgently needed because cancer screening and prevention disparities exist with regard to delivery of evidence-based interventions (EBIs). Effective strategies to improve implementation of EBIs in primary care community health centers (CHCs) that can eliminate these disparities are not known or poorly understood. Implementation science can contribute new knowledge that will transform CHCs' ability to serve the nation's most vulnerable populations. The BRIDGE-C2 Center will: 1) create a sustainable infrastructure for developing, conducting, and continuously evaluating implementation strategies that enhance primary care's ability to equitably deliver evidence-based cancer screening and prevention interventions to all people, emphasizing closing care gaps for vulnerable populations; 2) build capacity and training opportunities, and engage a multi-disciplinary team of implementation science and methods experts, to facilitate the development of innovative approaches relevant to our grand challenge; and 3) identify strategies to improve implementation of cancer screening and prevention EBIs in primary care, and conduct research / develop pragmatic methods to tailor, enhance, and support the adoption and sustainability of these strategies. We will build on the strong established partnerships between researchers at Oregon Health & Science (OHSU) primary care, the OHSU Knight Cancer Institute, and the OCHIN Implementation Laboratory (a well-established national network of >500 CHCs that share an electronic health record through the OCHIN Practice-Based Research Network). The BRIDGE-C2 Center will conduct pilot studies that develop and test strategies to improve implementation of EBIs, rapidly scale up successful pilots to conduct large scale pragmatic trials, and widely disseminate effective innovations to primary care practices caring for underserved populations. Woven throughout these activities will be the Center's focus on mentoring and training early career implementation scientists and leveraging collaborations to increase implementation science capacity. The Center's Administrative Core will serve as the nucleus that bridges the Research Program and Implementation Laboratory, providing support for research activities, leadership, governance, investigator development, dissemination, evaluation, and a connection to the national ISCCC network. Our first two research pilots aim to improve cervical cancer screening and follow-up care and tobacco cessation. Our first two methods pilots will create novel capabilities to predict needed implementation support based on provider and practice characteristics. We will spread our discoveries and create mechanisms for widely disseminating our findings and innovations to scientific, professional, and community networks to increase implementation of cancer screening and prevention EBIs and decrease health disparities.",2019-09-19T12:09:00Z,2024-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-19-006,nofo_RFA-CA-19-006,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,PORTLAND,OR,UNITED STATES,isc3

As an Advanced Center, the vision of the Washington University Implementation Science Center for Cancer Control (WU-ISCCC) is to conduct implementation research to help eliminate cancer disparities in rural and other disadvantaged communities. Goal. The overall goal of the WU-ISCCC is to build a rigorous, scientific evidence base for rapid-cycle implementation research to increase the reach, external validity, and sustainability of effective cancer control interventions. Our goal and Center activities capture three distinct features: (1) a focus on elimination of cancer disparities; (2) the need for rapid-cycle studies; and (3) the use of systems science approaches to enhance methods and outcomes in implementation science. Setting. Our Center will be housed in an exceptional environment that fosters transdisciplinary collaboration, catalyzes new ideas, and ensures support for research that finds solutions for complex implementation challenges in real-world settings with high cancer disparities (rural and urban counties in Missouri and Illinois). Substantial matching contributions from Washington University will allow us to strategically invest in new ideas. Aims. The specific aims of the Center are to: (1) advance the field of implementation science in cancer control by conducting innovative and impactful research; (2) expand an exceptional, diverse team of implementation science investigators and stakeholders; (3) organize and integrate Center components to facilitate transdisciplinary team science; (4) develop an Implementation Laboratory (known as the “Innovation Incubator”) to serve as a conduit for innovative, rapid-cycle, and impactful research; and (5) address cancer disparities by making it as easy as possible for disadvantaged populations to encounter, use, and benefit from evidence-based interventions. Innovations and impact. The WU-ISCCC will be innovative and provide a significant return on the scientific investment. First, our Center has distinctive features that include a combined focus on cancer disparities, the application of strategies to conduct rapid-cycle studies, and the use of systems science approaches. Second, we have assembled a diverse, world class team with strong linkages to multiple practice settings that will be critical parts of our Innovation Incubator. Third, we will engage investigators from different disciplines and invest in the development of early career scholars as cancer implementation scientists. Fourth, we will strategically and creatively disseminate products in ways that will benefit researchers, practitioners, and community members. Fifth, we have developed a focused strategy for collective integration of our projects, cores, and units to ensure that the WU-ISCCC impact is greater than the sum of its individual parts. In summary, the WU-ISCCC will be a national resource for furthering implementation science for eliminating cancer disparities.",2019-09-18T12:09:00Z,2024-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-19-006,nofo_RFA-CA-19-006,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,SAINT LOUIS,MO,UNITED STATES,isc3
P50CA244432,Optimizing Implementation in Cancer Control: OPTICC,"OVERALL SUMMARY The mission of the OPTICC (Optimizing Implementation in Cancer Control) Center is to improve cancer outcomes by supporting optimized implementation of evidence-based interventions (EBIs) in cancer control. Optimized implementation occurs when: (1) the strategies employed to implement EBIs address the key barriers to implementation that are active in the specific settings in which implementation occurs, and (2) those strategies reflect the best possible methods for addressing the barriers. Despite two decades of progress in implementation science (IS), practical tools and guidance to support optimized EBI implementation are lacking; as a result, strategies are often mismatched to barriers and are often not optimized for effectiveness, efficiency, or fit with local resources. The result is suboptimal implementation in the form of lost time, effort, and resources and, ultimately, poorer cancer outcomes. The OPTICC Center will advance IS and, in turn, improve EBI implementation in cancer control by developing, testing, and refining innovative methods for optimizing EBI implementation. The OPTICC Center is a strategic collaboration of the University of Washington (UW), Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute (KPWHRI), and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC). Three cores will support its work. The Administrative Core will promote multidisciplinary collaboration, research excellence, and methodological innovation. It will also lead Center outreach and dissemination efforts, evaluate Center impact, and coordinate Center activities. The Research Program Core will conduct innovative implementation studies, method and measurement studies, and small pilot studies that advance the Center’s “grand challenge” IS theme of optimizing EBI implementation. A three-stage approach to optimizing EBI implementation will be taken—identify and prioritize barriers, match strategies, and test strategies—with measurement development spanning all three stages. The Implementation Laboratory Core will establish and coordinate a network of diverse clinical and community sites to conduct “in vivo” IS studies, implement cancer control EBIs, and shape the Center’s research agenda. The Center’s initial studies will focus on optimizing implementation of screening EBIs for cervical, colorectal, breast, and ovarian cancer. However, the methods for optimizing EBI implementation that the Center will develop, test, and refine can be applied broadly across the cancer care continuum, for a wide range of cancers, to answer a wide range of IS questions.",2019-09-20T12:09:00Z,2024-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-19-006,nofo_RFA-CA-19-006,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,SEATTLE,WA,UNITED STATES,isc3
P50CA244433,The Implementation Science Center for Cancer Control Equity,"Abstract - Overall After decades of research developing and testing interventions for cancer control, we have the evidence needed to prevent more than half of all cancers. The impact of these strategies on cancer outcomes is significant for both the general population and low income and under-represented groups that bear a disproportionate share of preventable cancer burden, but evidence-based interventions have not been uniformly used across population groups. Gaps in implementation of the evidence base can be seen for nearly all known cancer prevention and early detection strategies. As a result, we incur substantial avoidable cancer morbidity and mortality and tolerate preventable inequities. The Implementation Science Center for Cancer Control Equity (ISCCCE) will create an ecosystem for robust implementation science (IS) related to cancer prevention and control in Massachusetts community health centers (CHCs) and their local communities. Our theme, improving community health by integrating health equity and implementation science for evidence-based cancer control, reflects our critical mass of expertise in cancer disparities, IS, and community-based cancer prevention and control research. Our “grand challenge” is to address the inequitable implementation and limited scale of evidence-based interventions by developing and testing implementation strategies aimed at narrowing health inequities and by advancing methods that carefully consider the low-resource, complex nature of CHCs where adaptation and cost-effective solutions are needed most. The implementation studies we conduct will address inequities within CHC clinical practice as well as prevention interventions that link to community resources and assets. Our I-Lab is comprised of 31 CHCs who are members of the Mass League of Community Health Centers and use a common EHR vendor- neutral population management system that has extensive reporting capability within and across CHCs, which will allow us to study implementation outcomes in different geographic settings across the state using common measures. Given that achieving equity in community health requires clinical, community, and policy-level interventions, our pilots will also examine how to expand the impact and sustainability of CHCs’ cancer prevention efforts through effective partnerships in community and policy settings. Our Network Unit connects us directly with other Moonshot IS initiatives and national community health leadership, and expands opportunities for collaboration and synergy, building IS capacity in our own institutions and across the nation.",2019-09-20T12:09:00Z,2024-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-19-006,nofo_RFA-CA-19-006,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,BOSTON,MA,UNITED STATES,isc3
P50CA244688,Pragmatic Implementation Science Approaches to Assess and Enhance Value of Cancer Prevention and Control in Rural Primary Care,"Project Summary/Abstract – Overall The theme of our proposed Implementation Science Center is “Pragmatic implementation science approaches to assess and enhance the value of cancer prevention and control in rural primary care.” We will apply and advance frameworks, pragmatic methods, and measures related to cost, benefits, and value that are rigorous, but also generalizable across rural primary care settings that are often struggling with low resources, and a high need population. These models and methods will be used to guide selection and implementation of evidence-based programs for cancer prevention and control (CPC). We will initially focus on lung cancer screening in rural primary care settings, first in Colorado and then nationally through collaboration with a well- established primary care network (i.e., National Research Network). Our overarching framework will be our enhanced RE-AIM/PRISM model, which is an extension of the broadly used Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance framework with the addition of contextual factors (e.g., Intervention characteristics, implementation and sustainability infrastructure). It will serve as the basis to develop and test innovative assessments of costs, benefits, and value from the perspective of different stakeholders to understand and guide implementation. We will meaningfully engage with and include the perspectives of patients, providers, and staff stakeholders in all our studies. Our pilot Implementation Study will adapt, implement, and evaluate strategies using stakeholder-engaged approaches to value to guide the implementation of shared decision-making and smoking cessation related to lung cancer screening. Our Methods Unit will refine and evaluate our pragmatic cost assessment methods to determine implementation/replication costs from the perspective(s) of patients, providers, and delivery staff and then develop and pilot test brief survey measures of preferences regarding the relative benefit of different RE-AIM outcomes. We will then assess relationships among RE-AIM outcomes preferences and selection of different CPC programs. Finally, our Outreach and Network Unit will engage in a) outreach activities targeted at junior and mid-career investigators and practitioners including online professional development (e.g., graduate certificate program, micro-certification) and tailored mentoring and technical assistance approaches; b) dissemination activities to support the packaging and communication of research findings; and c) collaboration activities to facilitate partnerships on CPC and implementation science using multiple channels and including development of shared pragmatic D&I measures and data.",2019-09-20T12:09:00Z,2024-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-19-005,nofo_RFA-CA-19-005,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,Aurora,CO,UNITED STATES,isc3
P50CA244690,Advancing the Quality of Cancer Care through Behavioral Economics and Implementation Science,"The grand challenge addressed by the Penn Implementation Science Center in Cancer Control (Penn ISC3) is to apply insights from behavioral economics to accelerate the pace at which evidence-based practices for cancer care are deployed to improve outcomes for individuals with cancer. Penn offers a unique environment in which to conduct this paradigm-shifting work, given our expertise in implementation science, behavioral economics, and innovative cancer care delivery. The complementary and multi-disciplinary expertise of the three MPIs (Bei- das, Bekelman, Schnoll), coupled with existing Penn resources, including the Penn Center for Cancer Care Innovation [PC3I], the Center for Health Incentives and Behavioral Economics [CHIBE], and the Penn Imple- mentation Science Center at the Leonard Davis Institute [PISCE@LDI], represent a unique opportunity to ad- vance the quality of cancer care. The Administrative Core, led by Drs. Beidas, Bekelman, and Schnoll, will ensure that the activities of Penn ISC3 are coordinated, synergistic, and congruent with timelines. The Implementation Laboratory, led by Drs. Bekelman and Shulman, represents a diverse ecosystem that includes five hospitals and linked clinical sites, with over 200 oncologists that serve over 15,000 unique new patients annually. Our Research Program, led by Drs. Beidas and Buttenheim, will oversee the development and testing of implementation strat- egies that target patients and clinicians within our Implementation Lab and are centered on the idea of ‘nudging’ for optimal implementation and effectiveness outcomes. The Research Program includes investigators with ex- pertise in implementation science, behavioral economics, cancer care delivery research, healthcare innovation, measurement, and mixed methods. In the first two years, we propose three Signature Pilot Projects and two Methods Projects with a commitment to rapid learning that will allow Penn ISC3 to be optimally nimble. Signature Pilot Project 1 (Jenssen/Leone) tests patient- and clinician-directed implementation strategies to increase referral to tobacco cessation programs among cancer patients. Signature Pilot Project 2 (Bekelman/Patel) tests patient- and clinician-directed implementation strategies to increase higher-value bone modifying agents in patients with breast, lung, and prostate cancer. Common methods and measures are linked to allow for pooling of data and to accomplish our objectives of testing multilevel implementation strategies and mechanisms across contexts. Our exploratory and high-reward Signature Pilot Project 3 (Bekelman/Rendle) will test a patient-directed imple- mentation strategy that leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning to promote oral chemotherapy ad- herence and symptom management. Two methods projects, in support of the Projects, will advance the science of implementation methods. Methods Project 1 will develop a toolkit for the application of rapid cycle approaches (Asch/Buttenheim); Methods Project 2 will use qualitative comparative analysis to characterize multilevel con- textual variation (Barg/Rendle). The Penn ISC3 has the potential to identify novel, disseminable, and scalable ways to advance the quality of cancer care and improve the health outcomes for individuals with cancer.

P50CA244693,iDAPT: Implementation and Informatics - Developing Adaptable Processes and Technologies for Cancer Control,"PROJECT SUMMARY iDAPT Implementation and Informatics - Developing Adaptable Processes and Technologies for Cancer Control is a developing center with an emerging theme on the use of technologies to support rapid cycle and real time deployment and testing of implementation processes and adaptations within cancer control. The Administrative Core will manage the Center, ensure that iDAPT is engaged with “real world” clinical partners, patients, and families, is well-networked with the Implementation Science Centers in Cancer Control consortium, and engage in a comprehensive evaluation of Center activities and milestones. The Research Program will include an Implementation Studies Unit with an initial 2-year pilot study using adaptable technology to enhance shared decision-making in survivorship care planning for survivors of breast cancer. The Research Program also includes a Methods Unit with an initial innovation pilot study to test the feasibility of natural language processing to measure communication patterns pre-implementation and to monitor implementation fidelity of programs designed to enhance within-team and clinical team-to-patient electronic communication. The Research Program is expected to complete 8 to 10 pilot studies. In order to foster research aligned with iDAPT’s theme, we will build and sustain iDAPT’s Implementation Laboratory which incorporates capacity building and infrastructure for testing the use of technologies to support rapid cycle and real time deployment of implementation processes and adaptations within cancer control. The laboratory includes primary care and oncology clinics in our local “Hubs” in southern Appalachia (North Carolina) and the northeast (Massachusetts) and “Spokes” including over 900 community-based oncology clinics in the NCIs National Community Oncology Research Program and nationwide Veteran’s Administration clinics. iDAPTs leadership is a multi-disciplinary team of experts with extensive experience in cancer-focused implementation science, behavioral science, computer engineering and computer science, clinical informatics, formative qualitative methods, epidemiology, and biostatistics. The iDAPT Developing Center will be considered successful if we achieve the following outcomes: (1) a robust, collaborative Implementation Laboratory with partners who are knowledgeable and experienced with implementation science in cancer control; (2) completion of 8 to 10 pilot projects related to iDAPTs emerging theme; (3) pilot grantees and lab partners are prepared to lead investigator initiated studies as a result of capacity building and pilot grant experiences; (4) junior faculty and underrepresented persons are engaged in all Center activities; (5) The field of implementation science in cancer control is advanced aligned within iDAPT’s emerging theme; and (6) iDAPT is part of a new network of ISCCCs who collectively build the field of implementation science in cancer control.",2019-09-18T12:09:00Z,2024-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-19-005,nofo_RFA-CA-19-005,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,WINSTON-SALEM,NC,UNITED STATES,isc3
P50CA247749,MSK SPORE in Genomic Instability in Breast Cancer,"ABSTRACT The research projects proposed in this SPORE address genomic instability in breast cancer. Three areas are the focus of study: homologous recombination deficiency, chromosomal instability and APOBEC mutagenesis. Our ultimate plan is to exploit tumor specific vulnerabilities by virtue of their underlying genomic instability. These profiles of genomic instability have offered novel insights about the drivers breast cancer development and progression. There are opportunities for therapeutic advances in breast cancer, which have emerged based on the initial successes, for example, in utilizing homologous recombination deficiency by treatment with a PARP inhibitor. The plan is to determine the optimal use of these agents and develop novel agents for these tumors. Chromosomal instability, which does not necessarily have a unique pattern of mutations, is associated with a poor prognosis, but no specific therapeutic strategy at present. The link between chromosomal instability and innate immune signaling has been made, and the goal is to exploit this connection for therapy. For APOBEC, we know that a characteristic pattern of SNVs are observed, but in this application, we are highlighting the role of APOBEC in the acquisition of drug resistance, and introducing novel approaches for reliably identifying and therapeutically targeting breast cancers with an active APOBEC mutagenesis process. In summary, the goals are to take the risks of genomic instability (poor prognosis, rapid development of resistance) and turn genomic instability into an advantage for therapeutic targeting, thereby improving the prognosis for high risk breast cancers.",2020-08-13T12:08:00Z,2025-07-31T12:07:00Z,PAR-18-313,award_P50CA247749,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,NEW YORK,NY,UNITED STATES,spore_breast_cancer_msk
P50CA254838,The Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center SPORE in Leukemia,"OVERALL ABSTRACT Despite recent advances in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the majority of AML patients relapse following treatment and the overall five-year survival rate for adults with AML remains 25-29%. Thus, an urgent need to improve therapy for AML patients remains. The MSK SPORE in Leukemia will leverage collective efforts to develop effective targeted therapies and immunotherapeutic approaches for several recurrent molecular subtypes of AML, including some which lack therapeutic options entirely. The overall translational aims of the MSK SPORE in Leukemia are to 1) interrogate genetic and molecular pathways required for AML initiation and maintenance; 2) develop novel targeted therapies and immunotherapeutic approaches for AML based on recurrent genomic alterations and leukemia stem-cell (LSC) specific markers; and 3) identify and validate the mechanism of action, therapeutic efficacy, and predictors of response/resistance of mechanism-based therapies for AML patients. To pursue these aims, we have assembled a multidisciplinary team with complementary expertise in the clinical management of AML, cancer genetics, cancer epigenetics, functional genomics, molecular pathology, biostatistics, computational biology, and multiplatform data integration. We will pursue these aims through four projects, each addressing a different unmet need in the clinical management of AML. Project 1 will elucidate genetic and epigenetic mechanisms of IDH inhibitor therapeutic resistance and perform a clinical trial exploring the efficacy and safety of combining the FLT3 inhibitor gilteritinib with mutant selective IDH1/2 inhibitors for FLT3/IDH-mutant AML. Project 2 will characterize the clinical, molecular, and biological features of complex karyotype (CK) AML, for which there is no treatment, and validate a novel approach to targeting CK AML via inhibition of the metabolic enzyme oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (OGDH). Project 3 will evaluate a novel therapeutic approach for targeting common, poor prognosis spliceosomal-mutant AML subtypes via inhibition of protein arginine methyltransferases in preclinical models and a phase I/II clinical trial. Project 4 will determine the safety and efficacy of a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell approach targeting a leukemia stem cell-specific antigen while sparing normal hematopoietic stem cells, specifically, a fully humanized CD371 targeting CAR T cell platform bolstered by constitutive IL-18 secretion. All projects will be supported by the Biospecimen, Biostatistics, Genomics, and Bioinformatics Shared Resource Cores, which will assist with the preparation and analysis of human tissues and genomic, immune, and clinical data, and an Administrative Core to ensure project integration. Finally, pilot projects in the Developmental Research Program and career mentorship via the Career Enhancement Program are fully integrated into the SPORE to ensure that a future generation of researchers is prepared to further advance our long-term objectives of enhancing therapy, reducing the morbidity of treatments, and ultimately eliminating this disease as a cause of premature death",2021-08-24T12:08:00Z,2026-06-30T12:06:00Z,PAR-18-313,award_P50CA254838,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,NEW YORK,NY,UNITED STATES,spore_in_leukemia_msk
P50CA254897,Epigenetic Therapies - New Approaches,"ABSTRACT (Overall) Epigenetics refers to stable gene expression patterns mediated by DNA methylation and/or chromatin remodeling and is involved in cellular identity and repression of spurious transcription, including from repetitive elements. Over the past 20 years, in work led in part by investigators in this application, epigenetic changes were recognized as important drivers of cancer formation, progression and resistance to therapy. This recognition, along with the reversible nature of the biochemical modifications required for epigenetics led to the field of Epigenetic Therapy, which aims to reprogram gene expression to achieve a therapeutic effect. This field, which started with DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitors, has grown to a dozen epigenetic targets and over 30 drugs in clinical trials. Four targets have made it to US-FDA approval (DNMTs, Histone Deacetylases (HDACs), EZH2 and Isocitrate Dehydrogenases) and tens of thousands of cancer patients benefit from this every year. With the identification of new targets and the recognition that epigenetics is involved in sensitivity and resistance to chemotherapy and immunotherapy, the clinical potential of epigenetic therapy has begun to be explored in earnest. There remain fundamental challenges, from the lack of robust biomarkers of activity, to the emergence of resistance, and to the unexplained divide in responses between hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. This SPORE application will address all of these challenges. The SPORE team consists of investigators who are pioneers in the fields of cancer epigenetics and epigenetic therapy and explores new epigenetic targets and combination strategies along with a robust biomarker analysis pipeline to identify patients likely to respond and pharmacodynamic markers of response. The team leverages a strong clinical and translational pipeline built through the Van Andel Institute Stand Up To Cancer Epigenetics Dream Team, which has conducted 14 epigenetic therapy clinical trials in the past few years, and is fully committed to the clinical trials proposed in this application. This Epigenetic Therapy SPORE encompasses four major themes: (i) Develop and test drugs against new epigenetic targets (Projects 1, 2), (ii) Mechanistic and translational studies of immunosensitization by epigenetic therapy (projects 1-3), (iii) Studies of drug combinations that enhance the efficacy of known epigenetic drugs (projects 1-3); and (iv) Biomarker studies to define sensitivity and resistance to epigenetic therapy in the clinic (all Projects). These themes will be addressed through 3 projects: (i) Cyclin Dependent Kinases as Epigenetic Therapy Targets; (ii) Epigenetic synergy between DNMT and EZH1/2 inhibitors; (iii) Linking epigenetic-therapy induction of inflammasome signaling to generation of a BRCAness phenotype. These projects will be supported by three cores (administrative, pathology, genomics) and a key goal will also be to mentor the next generation of Epigenetic Therapy investigators and support cutting-edge science through the Career Enhancement and Developmental Research Programs.",2021-08-16T12:08:00Z,2026-06-30T12:06:00Z,PAR-18-313,award_P50CA254897,CORIELL INSTITUTE FOR MEDICAL RESEARCH,CAMDEN,NJ,UNITED STATES,spore_epigenetics
R01CA204115,"Towards True Precision Oncology: Validation of a Comprehensively Humanized, Autologous Mouse Model","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Progress in the early detection and treatment of cancer requires accurate model systems to further evaluate new, promising discoveries. Small animal, and in particular mouse, model systems are attractive to researchers for numerous reasons, including their ease of use and well-described platforms. Immunotherapy has revolutionized clinical oncology, but lacks pre-clinical models of the human immune system and human cancer to investigate new modalities and limitations/toxicities of treatment regimens. The ability to grow human tumors in immunodeficient mice (so-called patient-derived xenografts, or PDXs) allows researchers to work directly with human cancer tissue in a controlled setting. However, PDX models are limited by their lack of an intact immune system. The broad objective of this proposal is to validate an in vivo model to evaluate human tumors in the context of a complete and intact human immune system in a completely personalized and autologous fashion. Herein, we propose to: (1) validate the ability to establish humanized mice from patients with melanoma; (2) evaluate tumor growth and lymphocyte development in autologous human melanoma tumors established in humanized mice; and (3) validate the ability of this humanized system to serve as a model for cancer immunotherapy treatment response and toxicity. In each of these areas, we will leverage our multi- institutional team's individual expertise along with our institutional infrastructure to maximize the success of the experimental aims. Furthermore, we will participate in the Oncology Models Forum and utilize the NCIP Hub resources to ensure that the methodology, data, and biologic model systems that result from this project are made widely available to the general research community for future, hypothesis-driven research. Taken together, the studies described in this research proposal will meet multiple goals and address several unmet needs identified in this grant opportunity, thus significantly enhancing the applicability of a fully autologous and immunocompetent precision model system for use in translational oncology research.",2017-01-09T12:01:00Z,2020-12-31T12:12:00Z,PAR-16-059,nofo_PAR-16-059,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,SAINT LOUIS,MO,UNITED STATES,omf
R01CA204136,Credentialing murine models for glioblastoma preclinical drug development,"ABSTRACT Precision medicine promises to revolutionize oncology by targeting drugs to specific mutations. However, targeted drugs have failed to produce durable clinical responses when used as single agents in glioblastoma (GBM), the most common and deadly primary brain tumor. Genetically engineered mouse (GEM) models are essential for functional validation of such mutations, but technical limitations have prevented their widespread use in preclinical cancer drug development. The Miller Lab has developed non- germline GEM (nGEM) models. The Berens Lab has performed comprehensive genomic and chemovulnerability profiling in a genetically diverse and faithful panel of patient-derived human xenograft (PDX) models. The Johnson Lab has developed a novel chemical proteomics method, multiplex inhibitor beads coupled with mass spectrometry (MIB-MS), to assess the activation state of the cellular kinome en masse and has shown that dynamic kinome reprogramming contributes to targeted drug resistance. In this Multi-PI project, we will combine our expertise to address the following Aims: (1) To credential PDX models against human GBM by kinome proteomics; (2) To develop genetically-matched nGEM models from distinct cells of origin; and (3) To credential PDX and nGEM models by dynamic kinome profiling. We will develop a genetically diverse panel of nGEM models with defined driver mutations and cellular origins that will be useful adjunct to PDX for preclinical drug development. We will then credential both PDX and nGEM models against resected GBM specimens using cross-species genome, transcriptome, and kinome, and drug response profiling. Models will be genomically matched to their human counterparts and used to develop rational combination therapies that combat single agent resistance mechanisms in genomically- defined tumor subtypes. This work will therefore help realize the promise of precision medicine in neuro- oncology.",2016-12-13T12:12:00Z,2020-11-30T12:11:00Z,PAR-16-059,nofo_PAR-16-059,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,CHAPEL HILL,NC,UNITED STATES,omf
R01CA207445,Identifying the Molecular and Cellular Basis of Invasive Phenotype in Human DCIS,"In order to study the molecular mechanisms underlying DCIS progression, we developed a model that we refer to as mouse-intraductal (MIND). MIND involves injection of epithelial cells derived from patient DCIS into the mammary ducts of immunocompromised mice. DCIS MIND xenografts exhibited the full spectrum of human DCIS including invasive progression. Histology of xenografted DCIS lesions that progressed to invasion showed disruption of basement membrane and myoepithelial layer by the invasive cells, retraction of myoepithelial layer and microinvasion. Therefore, the DCIS MIND model is a valuable tool for studying the early molecular mechanisms underlying DCIS invasive progression in a manner that is individualized to each patient DCIS. This proposal that is aimed at further improving the translation application of MIND models by mimicking the natural microenvironment of human DCIS in mice, is directly responsive to this FOA. The following specific aims (SA) are proposed: SA 1) Humanize mouse mammary fat pads with patient derived immortalized fibroblasts and study effects on DCIS progression to invasion, pathology and biomarker expression. The DCIS xenografts ± humanized fat pads will be assessed for pathology, biomarker expression and progression to invasion. We expect the xenografted DCIS with humanized mammary fat pads to more closely resemble patient DCIS with respect to pathology and biomarker expression. We also expect the humanized fat pads to enhance DCIS invasive progression in a fraction of DCIS MIND xenografts. Additionally, we will correlate DCIS epithelial cell inherent molecular aberrations (gene expression and/or genomic aberrations) to DCIS invasive behavior in the DCIS MIND xenografts. SA 2) Reconstitute the mouse hematopoietic system with patient derived immune cells and study effects on DCIS progression to invasion, pathology and biomarker expression. The experimental procedure involves reconstitution of mouse hematopoietic system with patient derived immune cells. We will utilize MISTRG mice, which are highly permissive for human hematopoiesis including support of the development and function of monocytes, macrophages and NK cells. DCIS xenografts ± patient derived immune system will be assessed for human immune cell infiltration to DCIS, DCIS pathology and invasive behavior as described in SA 1. We will correlate the recruitment of specific immune cells to DCIS as well as DCIS epithelial cell inherent molecular aberrations (gene expression and/or genomic aberrations) to DCIS invasive behavior in the MIND xenografts.",2017-03-09T12:03:00Z,2021-02-28T12:02:00Z,PAR-16-059,nofo_PAR-16-059,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS MEDICAL CENTER,KANSAS CITY,KS,UNITED STATES,omf
R01CA210561,Advancing the translatability of mouse models for cancer immunotherapy,"One of greatest challenges in oncology is eradicating cancer once it has metastasized. Cancer immunotherapy (IMT) with checkpoint blockade drugs like α-PD1 has shown remarkable sustained complete responses in a subset of cancer patients. But even within sensitive tumor types such as melanoma, only around 25% of patients respond. Many challenges remain to fully capitalize on existing and novel drugs that reactivate anti- tumor immunity. There is, therefore, an urgent unmet need for mouse models that better reflect human cancer. Our goal is to utilize the well characterized chemically-induced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) model to i) identify genetic features of tumors that establish IMT sensitivity, ii) define mechanisms and biomarkers of innate and acquired α-PD-1 drug resistance iii) define mechanisms of cooperation between αTGFβ and αPD1 therapy, and causes of failure. We will build on two novel and important observations that we have made: First, that a new α-panTGFβ antibody is as effective as IMT and cooperates with αPD-1 to double the IMT response rate, eliciting robust tumor rejection and sustained tumor immunity in the cSCC model. Secondly, just as in human cancers, we find that response to IMT is higher in chemically-induced cSCCs with high mutational single nucleotide variant (SNV) loads than those with low SNV load, including a genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM). In Aim 1 we will address how αTGFβ therapy enhances αPD-1 responses, by investigating drug effects on tumor immune cell numbers and function. We will validate our preliminary finding of Treg involvement in cooperativity between αPD1 and αTGFβ drugs using CyTO and MIBI analysis. We will also investigate involvement of other immune cell types, particularly myeloid, that may contribute to αTGFβ/αPD-1 drug cooperativity. In Aim 2, we will i dentify tumor cell genetic properties that determine IMT responses, and events driving development of IMT drug resistance, in a panel of independent DMBA/TPA induced syngeneic primary cSCC lines driven by distinct chemically-induced mutations of Kras or Hras. We will investigate effects of a) distinct Ras driver mutations b) SNV loads and neoantigen quality, and c) miRNA and RNA transcriptome profiles, on α-PD-1 and/or αTGFβ responses, and we will extend our studies into primary chemically induced sSCC, and validate the use of predictive biomarkers found in Aims 1 and 2 in this more realistic and heterogeneous model of human cancer. Finally, in Aim 3, we will validate our preclinical findings of mutational, transcriptomic and/or immune signatures predictive of IMT responses by interrogating pre-treatment and post-treatment clinical HNSCC samples from αPD-1 responding versus non-responding HNSCC patients under treatment at UCSF. By project completion, we will have validated a translational model for IMT that may be utilized by others for novel IMT agent development, and for mechanistic studies that will provide personalized treatment options to cancer patients.",2018-01-01T12:01:00Z,2022-06-30T12:06:00Z,PAR-16-059,nofo_PAR-16-059,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",SAN FRANCISCO,CA,UNITED STATES,omf
R01CA211339,Next-Generation Mouse Models of Endometrial Cancer,"Endometrial cancer is the most common malignancy of the female reproductive tract and the fourth most common cancer in women, and its incidence is increasing. Although surgery is effective in early stage cancers, the median survival of women with advanced endometrial cancer is less than one year, and in the past 30 years there have been no major improvements in the treatment of advanced disease. Neither chemotherapy nor radiation therapy significantly increases long‐term survival, and there are no therapies (targeted or conventional) effective against metastatic disease. Endometrial cancer research has lagged behind other cancers in grant allocation and progress relative to its clinical impact. More recently, systematic genome‐wide sequencing efforts, such as the National Cancer Institute’s The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), have brought the endometrial cancer genetic landscape into much clearer focus. These studies have yielded many previously unsuspected endometrial cancer tumor suppressor genes (such as FBXW7) altered in a large percentage of cases, and thus of obvious clinical and research significance. Cancers are complex amalgamations of various cell types that interact in myriad ways not only with one another, but also with the host organism. Hence, many features of cancer cannot be modelled in vitro. Consequently, in vivo genetic animal models are needed to further our understanding of these newly‐discovered genetic driver events in endometrial cancer. Genetically‐engineered mouse models of endometrial cancer have lagged considerably relative to other types of cancer, and such models remain to be generated for most of the frequent endometrial cancer driver events. One significant limitation has been the lack of fully optimized in vivo genetic models and the genetic tools to generate such models. We propose to build upon prior efforts and employ a general, validated strategy to build a suite of genetic tools useful for the generation and characterization of diverse mouse models of invasive and lethal endometrial cancer. The wide availability of this fully‐credentialed suite of genetic tools will bring new investigators into the field and greatly catalyze the development and use of clinically‐relevant mouse models of endometrial cancer. These models and the diverse array of translational investigations they will foster will lead to new insights into the biology of these endometrial cancer driver genes and also aid in the identification of potential Achilles’ heels that can be exploited for treatment.",2017-03-03T12:03:00Z,2020-09-30T12:09:00Z,PAR-16-059,nofo_PAR-16-059,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,DALLAS,TX,UNITED STATES,omf
R01CA211927,Reconstituting human pancreatic cancer development for translational research,"Project Summary/Abstract Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is almost universally lethal, reflecting its typical late-stage diagnosis, when effective treatment options are limited. Pancreatic intra-epithelial neoplasias (PanINs) represent an early, localized developmental stage of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA), when curative surgical resection remains feasible. Understanding features of PDA precursor lesions like PanINs could generate new strategies for early PDA diagnosis and intervention. We have created a novel system for genetic modification and growth of primary human pancreatic cells to reconstitute the development of lesions with molecular and pathological features of human PanINs. Upon orthotopic transplantation these immortalized clones produce stable human induced pancreatic intra-epithelial neoplasias (hiPanINs). Moreover, these PanIN lesions appear to be stable: after 6 months, they do not invade locally or metastasize. Here we propose to validate and optimize this new system for generating stable human PanIN-like lesions to enhance its uses for addressing unmet translational needs. In Aim 1 we propose to generate new hiPanIN clones whose mutational spectrum matches that found in native PanIN and PDA development. We will also assess prioritized biomarkers identified in the hiPanIN system in native human PanIN and PDA specimens. In Aim 2 we propose collaborative studies to test whether pancreatitis, further genetic modification, or extrinsic signals relevant to PDA can promote invasive or metastatic PDA in the hiPanIN orthotopic transplantation model. In summary our proposal is highly responsive to the FOA (PAR 16-059). We have created a “novel model to fill critical gaps in translational requirements” using “human and mammalian oncology models and their genetics”, and proposed studies to “ensure their appropriateness for addressing unmet translational needs.”",2017-02-01T12:02:00Z,2020-01-31T12:01:00Z,PAR-16-059,nofo_PAR-16-059,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,STANFORD,CA,UNITED STATES,omf
R01CA213102,Development of an autologous humanized model of melanoma exploring human thymic education capacity,"SUMMARY A constraint to studying human cancer is the limited availability of models with appropriate human stroma and immunity. This caveat is particularly relevant for melanoma, given the pivotal role the immune system plays in its development. To address these limitations, we plan to study melanoma biology and therapy in a humanized mouse (HM) model. We initially developed a mis-matched HM (mHM; tumor and hematopoietic stem cells [HSCs] from different sources), and now have generated an autologous HM (aHM; tumor, HSCs and mesenchymal stem cells [MSCs] from the same patient). In HM bearing tumors the human immune and mesenchymal cells from the patient's bone marrow homed into the growing tumor, migrated into the pre- existing mouse stroma, and interacted with the human cancer cells. Tumors grown in HM more closely resembled the originator tumor than those grown in non-HM mice, and the drift in gene expression caused by prior passaging was partially reversed. Signaling in key immune and stroma pathways was more prominent and closely resembled the originator patient in HM vs. non-HM models. The immune cells mounted effective tumor-specific immune responses, mediated by human immune cells including T cells. Significantly, immune responses upon immune therapies in the HM melanoma models showed a correlation with the patient's therapy results. Two salient and under-studied issues limit the wider application of HM: The relevance of the degree of tumor and immune matching, which can affect the faithfulness of immune response, and that can only be appreciated by comparing mHM and aHM. A second criticism to HM is xenogenic education of human T cells on mouse thymic cells, resulting from the lack of a functional human thymus in such models. In this application we will further address the relevance of an autologous versus mis-matched HM to test which approach gives rise to a more representative model of melanoma; secondly, using the same precursor cells from the patient we will reconstitute a functional thymus. The overarching goal of this proposal is to conduct a co-clinical trial where we will accomplish the following: 1) prospectively generate and characterize aHM and mHM from 20 melanoma patients, 2) test which approach yields a more representative melanoma HM model, 3) test in HM the immune drugs (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 [CTLA4] and programmed cell death protein 1 [PD-1] inhibitors) that each patient received and correlate with the clinical data, 4) identify the mechanisms involved in resistance to CTLA4/PD-1 inhibitors; and finally as an exploratory Aim in selected cases, we will 5) generate thymic epithelium from the same patient's HSCs that will result in HM with a fully autologous melanoma, thymus and immune system, thus enabling immune cell education in a strictly human context. This project will advance our understanding of the tumor-host interaction in melanoma and human cancer, by better characterizing the interplay between melanoma cells and the immune and stroma systems, leading to the discovery of new approaches to improve personalization of therapy and improve outcomes.",2017-08-01T12:08:00Z,2021-07-31T12:07:00Z,PAR-16-059,nofo_PAR-16-059,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,Aurora,CO,UNITED STATES,omf
R01CA218004,Translational Applications in an Animal Model of Pancreatic Cystic Neoplasm and Cancer,"ABSTRACT Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has a median 5-year survival of only 8%, and early diagnosis of PDAC is an area of highest priority for the NCI. Amongst the best-recognized risk factors for PDAC are mucinous pancreatic cysts, of which the most common subtype is known as intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN). Currently, IPMN patients either undergo surgical resection due to “worrisome” imaging features, or are followed conservatively by serial imaging studies for risk of progression to invasive PDAC. Unfortunately, the imaging criteria reflexing patients to surgery are imperfect, leading to both over- and under-treatment of IPMNs. Further, there are no credentialed blood-based biomarkers with a sensitivity and specificity that warrants reliable therapeutic stratification. Our group has identified oncogenic mutations of KRAS and GNAS as the two most common driver mutations in IPMNs – one or other is present in ~96% of cases. We have now engineered the first animal model of IPMN that harbors the mutational combination (Kras;Gnas) found most commonly in the cognate human disease. Upon doxycycline induction, the Kras;Gnas mice uniformly develop cystic lesions by 6 weeks, with progression to invasive cancer in 25% of mice by 21 weeks, mimicking the multistep progression of human IPMN to PDAC. The objective of this proposal is to enhance the translational applicability of this model by using it as a controlled platform to address key unmet needs in the management of IPMNs in two areas: imaging correlates and circulating biomarkers. In Aim 1, we will use the animal model to investigate two novel imaging platforms – quantitative feature extraction from MRI scans using an indigenously developed algorithm known as “Enhancement Pattern Mapping” (EPM) and second, hyperpolarized MRI (HPMRI), in order to determine imaging correlates that coincide with the transition from low grade IPMN to cancer. In Aim 2, we will use a combination of unbiased mass spectrometry and array-based approaches to identify circulating proteins and autoantibodies, respectively that correlate with progression of murine IPMNs to PDAC. In addition, we will examine the potential of genomic liquid biopsies for cancer prediction, through utilizing an ultrasensitive and quantitative droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) platform for detection of mutant KRAS and GNAS DNA within circulating exosomes. All three classes of blood-based biomarkers (proteins, autoantibodies and exoDNA) will be assessed in matched murine plasma samples, which will allow us to estimate the additive performance for cancer detection using robust statistical paradigms. Both aims will benefit from ready access to imaging scans and biospecimens from IPMN patients for cross-species translational validation studies, through NCI-funded multicenter U01 consortia that are led by the PI. We believe this multidisciplinary proposal has the potential for long-term impact on PDAC mortality through practice changing alterations in the approach towards monitoring cancer progression in IPMNs.",2018-04-04T12:04:00Z,2022-03-31T12:03:00Z,PAR-17-245,nofo_PAR-17-245,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,HOUSTON,TX,UNITED STATES,omf
R01CA221957,Genomic and functional characterization of a panel of neuroblastoma patient-derived xenografts and cell lines,"In spite of major improvements in treating high-risk neuroblastoma (NB) over the past 2 decades, greater than 50% of recurrent high-risk NB patients still die of the disease. A critical challenge in developing new drugs for NB is the limited number of patients available for clinical trials. Preclinical models that represent the biological diversity (including drug resistance mechanisms) are needed for biological and preclinical therapeutic studies. The Children's Oncology Group (COG) NB committee has made providing patient samples to our laboratory a major priority, enabling us to establish 200 NB cell lines and a growing number (32 to date) of patient-derived xenografts (PDX) which are freely available to investigators world-wide via the COG Cell Line and Xenograft Repository (www.COGcell.org). To enhance the value of these NB preclinical models to the many labs utilizing them we propose to define the genomic landscape, gene expression profiles, and response to selected drugs in these models. Cell lines providing data that inform xenograft experiments would be a valuable resource and cell line xenografts are necessary for certain animal imaging experiments. We have established cell lines and PDXs from the same patient samples enabling a comparison of cell lines to cell line xenografts, and both to PDXs. Our hypotheses are: 1) A large well-characterized panel of cell lines and PDXs from patients encompassing the spectrum of high-risk NB biology after exposure to current therapies is essential for progress in developing novel therapeutics against recurrent disease. 2) Low-passage cell lines established in physiological hypoxia will yield drug response data both in vitro and as cell line xenografts that will be comparable to PDXs. The goals of this study are: 1) To characterize panels of NB in vitro and in vivo models, including isogenic pairs, (i.e. both cell line and PDX established from the same patient sample and also pairs established at diagnosis and from the same patient at disease progression) in terms of genomic landscape, genome-wide expression patterns (by RNA sequencing), expression of 200 selected proteins, and response to standard-of-care drugs. 2) To compare drug sensitivity to genomic alterations and genome-wide RNA expression to define molecular mechanisms of drug resistance. 3) To define the similarities or differences between cell line xenografts and PDXs using pairs of cell lines and PDXs established from the same clinical sample. 4) To compare the genomics of PDXs and cell lines to original patient tumor tissue and drug response data with PDXs and cell lines to clinical activity in patients of the same drugs. Our ultimate goal is to characterize a large robust panel of preclinical NB models for specific genomic abnormalities, genome-wide gene RNA expression and selected protein expression, and sensitivity/resistance to drugs commonly used for therapy and to ensure these models are readily available to all investigators studying neuroblastoma.",2017-12-15T12:12:00Z,2022-11-30T12:11:00Z,PAR-16-059,nofo_PAR-16-059,TEXAS TECH UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIS CENTER,LUBBOCK,TX,UNITED STATES,omf
R01CA222148,Conditionally Reprogrammed Cell Model for Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC),"Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most frequently diagnosed cancer (180,890 new cases in 2016) in men in the USA. Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is an effective first line therapy for locally advanced or metastatic disease. Unfortunately, once PCa recurs, the eventual development of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) remains an incurable disease and more effective therapies are needed. Currently, a limited number of cancer cell lines (LnCAP, PC3, DU-145, etc.) are available for research and many genetic mutations present in prostate cancer (e.g., SPOP mutation, FOXA1 mutation, TMPRSS2-ERG fusion, CHD1 loss) are not represented in such cells. New patient-derived cancer models are needed. However, patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models are successful at less than 2-5% efficiency with aggressive, high-grade metastatic tumors and organoid cultures only have an efficiency of 20%. However, our preliminary data demonstrate that conditional reprogramming (CR) has nearly a 100% success rate for establishing long-term cultures from either surgical prostate specimens or CT-guided biopsies. In this application, we propose the following specific aims to validate the potential of CR for translational use in human CRPC. We will first establish CR cultures from biopsies of 30 patients with CRPC and will characterize these culture genetically and phenotypically. Second, we compare the patients' drug response to those of corresponding tumor CR cells and their derivative CR- derived xenografts (CDXs). Lastly, we will use CR cultures in an unbiased high-throughput screen to identify new potential therapies for CRPC in collaboration with Dr. Craig Thomas at National Center for Advanced Translational Sciences (NCATS). New “hits” from the screen will be validated by both in vitro cell assays and xenograft models.",2019-06-01T12:06:00Z,2024-05-31T12:05:00Z,PAR-17-245,nofo_PAR-17-245,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,COLUMBUS,OH,UNITED STATES,omf
R01CA222907,Development and Application of a Porcine Model of Pancreatic Cancer,"“Development and Application of a Porcine Model of Pancreatic Cancer” PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The long-term goal of this research is to develop a platform on which experimental therapies for pancreatic cancer can be advanced to the clinic in a more efficient manner than achievable with current preclinical pancreatic cancer models. The focused objective of this R01 application is to develop a genetically-defined, autochthonous model of pancreatic adenocarcinoma in immunocompetent pigs, provide some validation data with respect to gross behavior, microscopy, tumor markers, genetic sequence, and transcription, and determine the model's utility for image-guided surgery. Tumors will be induced by local targeting of genes known to be associated with pancreatic cancer (namely, KRAS, p53, SMAD4, and CDKN2A), using a combination of transgenic subjects (the NSRRC Onco-pig), lentiviral-mediated in vivo gene transfer, and tumorigenic ductal cell implantation. Some murine models have failed to reflect human tumor biology because of differences in physiology, anatomy, and genetic sequence with humans. So, the rationale to build a porcine model of pancreatic cancer is that it should be more predictive of human tumor biology and response to therapy than murine models are, because swine have greater genetic and phenotypic homology with humans. The hypothesis of this R01 application is that forced expression of relevant mutant genes or transplanted tumorigenic pancreatic cells within the porcine pancreas will produce pancreatic tumors, and that this tumor model will be clinically relevant and useful. The utility of the model will be demonstrated with a comparative trial of reagents for Fluorescence Image-Guided Surgery, in experiments that would not be possible in the mouse. The work proposed in this R01 application will be accomplished through a collaborative team consisting of a general/oncologic surgeon (PI), a biomedical engineer with experience in molecule design, two molecular/cellular biologists with expertise in pancreatic cancer and gene editing, a medical oncologist who manages patients with pancreatic cancer, a pathologist specializing in pancreatic/GI cancers, sequencing and bioinformatics experts, and a biostatistician. This project is innovative because no large animal model of pancreatic cancer exists. The impact of a validated porcine model of pancreatic cancer would be to enhance, complement, and supplement preclinical data from other tumor models, and also to advance experimental anti-tumor therapies to the clinic in a more efficient manner, with fewer experimental therapies failing in clinical trials. In addition, a porcine model of pancreatic cancer could advance the design and development of minimally invasive catheters and energy sources used to ablate pancreatic tumors, and also to develop and/or improve techniques to detect, image, diagnose, and monitor these tumors.",2018-04-01T12:04:00Z,2022-09-30T12:09:00Z,PAR-17-245,nofo_PAR-17-245,UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA MEDICAL CENTER,OMAHA,NE,UNITED STATES,omf
R01CA225755,Enhancing the dog as a model for human cancers: from genome sequence towards clinical trials.,"SUMMARY The domestic dog has become increasingly useful as a comparative spontaneous cancer model to study genetic and environmental risk factors as well as for easing the transition between rodent and human clinical trials for novel cancer therapies. The many similarities between various cancer types affecting humans and dogs and the spontaneous development of these cancers in immune competent canine individuals living in a shared environment with us suggest a common aetiology. The shorter lifespan of dogs and the shorter time to relapse after cancer treatment allows data regarding efficacy, short and long term toxicity and side effects of novel cancer drugs to be generated in years rather than decades as in human clinical trials. However, certain limitations need to be overcome to make full use of the dog model. Slightly different classification systems for common cancers limit translation of data and clinical outcome from dog to human. The canine genome and annotation, especially that of complex immune gene families, could be improved to allow a more careful and correct comparison with the human genome and immune response, a key factor in cancer development and treatment. Using novel long-read sequencing techniques, we will generate a platinum CanFam4.0 genome and improved information of both gene and variant annotation for an old healthy female German shepherd. In addition, we will specifically focus on canine mammary tumors, lymphoma and osteosarcoma where improved models would benefit human studies, and the canine forms are diverse and only partly characterized. Since the molecular sub-classifications used in human cancers are not yet used for these canine cancers, we plan to characterize these tumor types in the dog population using several approaches to meet human standards. We will further set up a Scandinavian-wide veterinary oncology network for research collaboration, increased use of the dog as a model. We will perform repeated blood sampling from dogs with malignant mammary tumors to allow the study of tumor evolution and progression. All of this work will lay the groundwork to enable more useful and efficient future clinical trials.",2018-09-06T12:09:00Z,2023-08-31T12:08:00Z,PAR-17-245,nofo_PAR-17-245,UPPSALA UNIVERSITY,UPPSALA,,SWEDEN,omf
R01CA226756,Modeling Factors Associated with Risk of High-Grade Serous Carcinoma in Mice,"High-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) is the most common and most lethal type of “ovarian” cancer. Most HGSCs are now believed to arise from epithelium in the distal fallopian tube, though a minority of HGSCs lack evidence of tubal origin. Population-based studies have identified several factors that are strongly associated with reduced HGSC risk, including sterilization procedures based on tubal excision, high parity, and oral contraceptive (OC) use. We do not understand how OCs and high parity protect against HGSC or how these protective effects can be maximized. Likewise, the roles of the fallopian tubes and ovaries and their cross-talk in HGSC pathogenesis remain incompletely understood. Intact ovaries could contribute to HGSC development by harboring ectopic tubal epithelium from which non-tubal HGSCs may arise, and/or by exposing the distal fallopian tube epithelium (FTE) to hormones and other factors, including those in follicular fluid released at the time of ovulation. Given the many challenges associated with detecting HGSC precursors and small tubal HGSCs before they have metastasized, and effecting cures for women with widely metastatic HGSC, an enhanced focus on preventing these tumors is warranted. Genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) of cancer may provide tractable and relatively rapid systems with which to test cancer prevention strategies and inform cancer prevention trials in humans. To date, no GEMMs have been credentialed for use in studying factors known to alter HGSC risk. We have developed transgenic (Ovgp1-iCreERT2) mice that allow conditional (tamoxifen [TAM]-inducible) activation of Cre recombinase exclusively in the FTE. We have also identified specific combinations of conditional tumor suppressor gene (TSG) alterations, prioritized because they are known to be frequently inactivated in human HGSCs (Brca1, Trp53, Rb1, Nf1 [BPRN] and Brca1,Trp53, Pten [BPP]), that lead to oviductal HGSCs following TAM treatment of Ovgp1-iCreERT2 mice that also carry the conditional TSG alleles. FTE from these mice can be cultured as organoids and transformed in vitro, allowing some risk factors to be tested in parallel with studies in vivo. Our new HGSC GEMMs will be employed to test the impact of factors known to be associated with human HGSC risk, with the goal of credentialing the models as genetically and biologically relevant tools with which to better understand how specific factors reduce HGSC risk, and for future use in testing novel HGSC prevention strategies. Four Aims are proposed: 1) To test whether high parity slows oviductal tumor development and/or progression in our BPRN model of HGSC; 2) To determine whether hormones of the types present in OCs alter the development and/or progression of oviductal HGSCs in BPRN mice; 3) To establish the preventive effects of bilateral risk-reducing salpingectomy (RRS) and salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) on the development of ovarian and/or primary peritoneal HGSC in our BPRN and BPP models; and 4) To test effects of pre-ovulatory follicular fluid on FTE in vitro and in vivo.",2019-01-01T12:01:00Z,2023-12-31T12:12:00Z,PAR-17-245,nofo_PAR-17-245,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,ANN ARBOR,MI,UNITED STATES,omf
R01CA227089,Mammalian models for integrated metabolic and molecular profiling of malignant glioma,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Translational cancer research requires robust preclinical models to most effectively investigate the underlying biology of disease and develop new therapeutics. While all models are imperfect, it is essential to understand the degree by which each model system (e.g., cell culture, xenograft) recapitulates specific molecular and functional characteristics of human tumors. This may be particularly relevant for studying altered metabolism, a hallmark of cancer, as even subtle changes to the environment can greatly impact the metabolic phenotype of a tumor. Moreover, as cancer metabolism is tightly regulated by oncogenic signaling, the diversity of molecular alterations within a given malignancy may elicit unique metabolic characteristics; which, may greatly influence metabolic pathway dependencies for tumor proliferation and growth. To best determine the fidelity of preclinical models in preserving the metabolic features of human cancer, this requires cross-comparing matched patient tissue and preclinical models across tumors with various genetic alterations. However, such a comprehensive investigation has yet to be undertaken. This proposal will perform an integrated metabolic and molecular characterization of matched human tumors, direct-from-patient orthotopic xenografts (GliomaPDOX), and cell lines from patients with glioblastoma (GBM) – one of the most lethal human malignancies that also reside within the unique brain metabolic milieu. In Aim 1, stable isotope-labeled metabolic tracing and liquid chromatography- mass spectrometry (LC-MS) will be used to cross-compare the metabolic phenotypes of prospectively matched GBM patient tumors, GliomaPDOX, and cell lines to determine the metabolic characteristics that are preserved and/or lost from patient to preclinical model. Aim 2 proposes to determine, in genetically diverse preclinical GliomaPDOX models, whether specific metabolic phenotypes align with distinct molecular signatures. Finally, in Aim 3, in vivo genetic knockdown experiments will be performed to assess whether measured metabolic phenotypes represent targetable dependencies for GliomaPDOX growth, invasion, and survival. Collectively, the studies proposed in this application will provide critical insight into the translatability of preclinical GBM models for studying tumor metabolism; which, may ultimately have important implications for developing new therapeutics against metabolic dependencies in GBM, and potentially, other malignancies.",2018-06-06T12:06:00Z,2023-05-31T12:05:00Z,PAR-17-245,nofo_PAR-17-245,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,LOS ANGELES,CA,UNITED STATES,omf
R01CA229773,In Vivo Base Editing for Precision Oncology Models,"PROJECT SUMMARY Genetic mutation is the predominant driver of cancer cell growth and therapy resistance. In fact, a major goal of personalized medicine is to identify specific genetic changes in individual tumors with the notion that defining these changes will guide more effective and targeted treatment. While this precision oncology approach shows clinical promise, ongoing tumor sequencing efforts continue to identify potential new disease drivers and new mutations. How these uncharacterized mutant alleles contribute to disease is often not obvious, and requires functional examination. Genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) provide an ideal tool to investigate the consequences of genetic changes on tumor biology, yet existing approaches are not fast or precise enough to recreate the spectrum of genetic alterations seen in human cancer. We and others have used CRISPR-based genome editing to accelerate the generation of complex, genetically defined animal models. Yet, while CRISPR systems are fast and simple, the basic tools are imprecise in that they cause insertions and deletions that ablate gene function but cannot mimic the single nucleotide variants most often seen in human cancer. To build in vivo systems that recapitulate specific human cancer-associated mutations, our project exploits new CRISPR tools that couple Cas9 to cytidine deaminase enzymes and enable direct DNA mutagenesis at defined genomic regions. ‘Base editing’ (BE) technology offers far greater efficiency and flexibility than existing homology directed repair (HDR) approaches by eliminating the need to deliver exogenous DNA templates. We have systematically optimized the expression and activity of BE enzymes to increase the efficiency of genome modification and established a bioinformatic and experimental pipeline to predict and validate BE tools that recreate known and novel cancer mutations. In Aim 1, building from extensively optimized BE enzymes, we will generate a range of knock-in transgenic mice to maximize the number of possible genomic regions that can be mutated using BE, and validate the activity of these mice using a new fluorescence-based reporter system. Further, using a novel sensor assay, we will identify all human and mouse sgRNAs that can target recurrent cancer-associated mutation sites. Together, this work will define the BE efficiency of thousands of independent sgRNAs, and establish the first in vivo somatic base editing platforms. In Aim 2 we will use our in vivo BE tools to generate novel animal models of pancreatic and colorectal cancer, and examine the consequences of distinct cancer-associated mutations in each disease. This work will not only offer a new understanding of key oncogenic mutations, it will provide critical validation of the utility of in vivo BE in multiple cancer settings. By providing an easy and efficient path to capture the diversity of human disease alleles, we believe this new precision editing platform has the potential to fundamentally change the way we design and implement mouse cancer models for translational research.",2019-04-01T12:04:00Z,2024-03-31T12:03:00Z,PAR-17-245,nofo_PAR-17-245,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,NEW YORK,NY,UNITED STATES,omf
R01CA229784,Advancing treatment outcomes in malignant glioma by integrating immunotherapy and standard of care using genetically engineered mice that recapitulate molecular feature of human glioma,"Project Summary/Abstract Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a dreadful cancer with a median survival of 14 months due to a lack of effective therapy. Checkpoint blockade immunotherapies have shown promising clinical outcomes for several cancers, and as such there are now many early stage clinical trials for GBM. Trials are designed for both newly diagnosed and recurrent GBMs and in both cases, checkpoint blockade is administered on the background of standard of care (SOC) therapy for GBM, which consists of surgical debulking, followed by fractionated radiation (XRT) with concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide (TMZ) alkylating chemotherapy. In addition, most patients are subjected to steroid use (dexamethasone-Dex)) to alleviate post surgery neurological symptomatic relief. There is a critical deficiency in our understanding on how XRT/TMZ and steroid exposure affect the tumor microenvironment (TME), specifically the immune cells component. Therefore there is a pressing need to understand how the efficacy of checkpoint immunotherapies is affected by XRT/TMZ/Dex and delineate a clinical strategy that will maximize treatment effectiveness. In addition, we demonstrate that the composition and activation status of GBM immune infiltrates is influenced by the driver genotype of the GBM cells. Our proposal will fill a knowledge gap regarding the type and activation status of the immune infiltrate vis-à-vis tumor driver genotypes. The central hypotheses of our proposal are: 1) the immune landscape of GBM is related to the type of driver mutations (genotype) of the tumor and 2) the SOC for GBM will affect its immune component and function, both of which will directly influence the efficacy of PD-1 and CTLA-4 checkpoint blockade immunotherapies. We need to delineate those effects and understand them in order to modify GBM management protocols to take full advantage of the power of immunotherapy. We propose to use EGFR- and PDGFR-driven genetically engineered mouse models, which accurately recapitulate human GBM, to determine the effects of tumor genotype on the immunofauna, to unveil the consequences of SOC on immune function and to relate those findings to clinical practice. Our project will deliver on an effective translational use of genetically cutting edge models of GBM that accurately recapitulate human disease to inform the conduct of clinical trials and to mechanistically interpret their outcomes.",2018-07-01T12:07:00Z,2023-06-30T12:06:00Z,PAR-17-245,nofo_PAR-17-245,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,BOSTON,MA,UNITED STATES,omf
R01CA233486,Mouse modeling of HPV infection,"SUMMARY Our overall goal is to create a laboratory mouse-based model of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and disease to support the development of novel HPV vaccines. Translational research requires animal models that are robust representations of human pathology in which to test questions of clinical importance, and provide reliable information for the development of novel interventions and patient benefit. HPV is the primary etiologic agent of at least 5% of all cancers worldwide, mostly cervical and subsets of other anogential and head and neck cancers and potentially also non-melanoma skin cancers. Unfortunately, there is no specific antiviral therapy, but vaccine-based approaches are very promising. Many groups are bringing candidate therapeutic HPV vaccines to the clinic, including our pNGLV4aCRTE6E7L2 DNA, but to date there has been limited success in treating patients despite promising data with the vaccines in the current standard animal models. This demonstrates the need for more predictive animal models. HPV does not complete its life cycle and produce virions in mice or in cell culture monolayers and so HPV pseudovirions delivering a reporter construct are often used. This system does not fully mimic the assembly and maturation of the viral capsid in E4-expressing differentiating epithelium or provide a disease endpoint. A model that produces disease from virus produced in a papilloma and expressing clinically-relevant HPV sequences is required. Therefore, we propose to transform the utility of Mus musculus papillomavirus type 1 (MmuPV1) by incorporating key HPV sequences and credential it for use as a model for testing novel therapeutic and protective HPV vaccines. SPECIFIC AIM 1: To develop MmuPV1 viruses incorporating HPV sequences. Organ transplant recipients (OTRs) and HIV+ patients exhibit more severe and progressive HPV disease, and dramatically higher rates of HPV-associated malignancies. Non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSC) in immune-compromised patients are associated with a plethora of βHPVs that were initially described in epidermodysplasia verruciformis (EDV) patients.

R01CA233487,Federated Learning for Optimal Decision Making in Radiotherapy Using Panomics Analytics,"The complex environment of modern radiation therapy (RT) comprises data from a rich combination of patient- specific information including: demographics, physical characteristics of high-energy dose, features subsequent to repeated application of image-guidance (radiomics), and biological markers (genomics, proteomics, etc.), generated before and/or over a treatment period that can span few days to several weeks. Rapid growth of these available and untapped “pan-Omics” data, invites ample opportunities for Big data analytics to deliver on the promise of personalized medicine in RT. This is particularly true in promising but high-risk RT procedures such as stereotactic body RT (SBRT), which have witnessed tremendous expansion due to clinical successes in early disease stages and socio-economic benefits of shortened high dose treatments. This has led to the desire to exploit these treatments into more advanced stages of cancer, however, the unknown risks associated with increased toxicities hamper its potential. Therefore, robust clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) capable of exploring the complex pan-Omics interaction landscape with the goal of exploiting known principles of treatment response before and during the course of fractionated RT are urgently needed. The long-term goal of this project is to overcome barriers related to prediction uncertainties and human-computer interactions, which are currently limiting the ability to make personalized clinical decisions for real-time response-based adaptation in radiotherapy from available data. To meet this need and overcome current challenges, we will develop and quantitively evaluate: (1) federated graph-based supervised machine learning algorithms for robust prediction outcomes before and during RT; (2) federated deep reinforcement learning to dynamically optimize treatment adaptation; and (3) a user-centered software prototype for RT decision support using the extendable XNAT platform, with the broader goal of building a comprehensive real-time framework for outcome modeling and response-based adaption in RT. We hypothesize that the use of advanced federated machine learning techniques and user-centered tools will unlock the potentials to move from current population-based approaches limited by subjective experiences and heuristic rules into robust, patient-specific, user-friendly CDSSs. This approach and its corresponding software tools will be tested within two clinical RT sites of lung and liver cancers, to demonstrate its versatility and highlight pertinent human-computer factors and cancer specific issues. Impact statement: Patient-specific big data are now available before and/or during RT courses, offering new and untapped opportunities for personalized treatment. This study will overcome current shortcomings of population-based approaches and data underuse in current RT practice by investigating and developing a federated user-centered, personalized CDSS with the need for centralized data sharing and test its performance in rewarding but high-risk RT scenarios. The approach is also applicable to other modern cancer regimens.",2019-06-06T12:06:00Z,2024-05-31T12:05:00Z,RFA-CA-21-017,nofo_RFA-CA-21-017,H.

R01CA233944,Rapid and flexible precision oncology mouse models of epithelial malignancies epithelial malignancies,"Genome characterization has enabled the cataloging of genes altered in human tumors and stimulated the development of therapies that exploit these alterations. Still, functional studies are ultimately needed to interpret and exploit the genetic variation that exists in human cancers. Furthermore, it is now apparent that cancer phenotypes and responses to therapy are dramatically influenced by the tissue microenvironment, and hence it is necessary to have in vivo models that accurately recapitulate both the genetics and physiology of cancers in patients. Although existing genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) have been instrumental in validating cancer-promoting mutations and developing therapeutic concepts in a physiological and relevant context, these models are simply too slow and expensive to be broadly useful and only recapitulate a minor fraction of the genetic lesions associated with human cancer. Driven by the need for more accurate and facile models, this project combines CRISPR genome engineering and in vivo organ electroporation with the goal of producing the first-in-kind collection of genetically-defined mouse models of three major epithelial malignancies. We refer to these models as electroporation-based genetically engineered mouse models (EPO-GEMMs). EPO-GEMMs have a range of advantages over traditional GEMMs in that they are fast, affordable, modular, highly portable, and avoid the substantial waste associated with GEMMs produced by strain intercrossing. These models are fully somatic, enable focal tumor development and, importantly, enable the study of tumor-host interactions by allowing tumors to be rapidly engineered in hosts of different genetic backgrounds. Based on substantial preliminary data to validate the EPO-GEMM concepts, our project will produce and characterize EPO-GEMMs of stomach, prostate, and pancreatic cancer - three common human cancers for which existing mouse models do not exist or are tedious. We will then perform a series of demonstration projects to evaluate and illustrate the unique potential of the EPO-GEMM approach, ranging from testing the efficacy and toxicity of target inhibition, exploring the effects of specific immune cell types on cancer initiation and progression, and using synchronous cohorts of genetically defined cancer models to test new targeted therapies and immune oncology approaches. Therefore, our project is of direct relevance to the overarching goals of the Oncology Models Forum, as EPO- GEMMs constitute “translational research models that are robust representations of human biology, are appropriate to test questions of clinical importance, and provide reliable information for patients’ benefit”. Each of these models will be credentialed with the Oncology Model Fidelity Score and all reagents will be made available through the NCIP Hub. We believe that the development and detailed characterization of rapid, flexible, and immunocompetent EPO-GEMMs and the adoption of these models for pre-clinical studies will be critical for the functional annotation of genetic variation in human cancer and greatly contribute to the implementation of precision oncology.",2020-01-01T12:01:00Z,2024-12-31T12:12:00Z,PAR-17-245,nofo_PAR-17-245,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,NEW YORK,NY,UNITED STATES,omf
R01CA233983,Development of novel metastatic mouse models that recapitulate the major immune contexts of human colon cancer,"The purpose of this proposal is to develop novel mouse models of colorectal cancer (CRC) with appropriate immune responses. These models have been designed to address limitations present in current models of CRC in order to enhance their suitability for translational research in immunotherapy. Immune checkpoint inhibitors have revolutionized treatment of solid tumors, and brought to light the critical importance of tumor immune context in treatment outcome. CRC with DNA mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency is characterized by a high burden of somatic mutations, increased T cell infiltration, and a favorable response to checkpoint blockade. Unfortunately, the majority of CRC has a lower mutational burden and is refractory to these treatments. Preclinical mouse models are powerful platforms for investigating the factors underlying response to immunotherapy. However, no single model faithfully recapitulates primary tumor development in the colon microenvironment, metastatic dissemination to the liver and lung, and the major immune contexts underlying variability in immunotherapy response in human CRC. To address these significant translational deficiencies, we will use an innovative technique employing colonoscopy-guided sub-mucosal injection of lentivirus or tumor organoids to induce focal autochthonous and orthotopic tumors in the colon that readily metastasize. In Aim 1, we will engineer a model that modulates tumor immunogenicity through inducible expression of a model antigen. We will dissect the features of the induced anti-tumor T cell response and investigate the utility of this model for testing adoptive T cell therapy by transferring antigen-specific T cells. To potentiate adoptive T cell therapy and mirror ongoing clinical trials in humans, we will assess the efficacy of CRISPR-Cas9-mediated deletion of immune checkpoints in T cells prior to transfer. In Aim 2, we will model immunotherapy-responsive CRC by targeting the essential DNA MMR genes Msh2 and Mlh1 and use next-generation sequencing to characterize the mutational landscapes of resulting MMR-deficient versus proficient tumors. In Aim 3, we will perform preclinical trials of immune checkpoint blockade in these models to explore their ability to recapitulate the responses of human CRC patient populations. We will also test a novel combination of immunogenic chemotherapy and checkpoint blockade, based on the hypothesis that immunogenic cell death may sensitize tumors with low mutational burden or minimal pre-existing T cell involvement to immune attack. This strategy is aimed at improving treatment for the majority of CRC patients, whose tumors are non-immunogenic and non- responsive to immunotherapy. The overarching goal of this research plan is to develop and benchmark a set of highly comparable CRC models that will be used to address why only a fraction of patients respond to immunotherapy. The proposed strategy is innovative in that it uses cutting-edge methods in mouse genetic engineering and cancer modeling to capture critical features of human CRC. This research will also include deep characterization of the immune microenvironment in these models and a comparison to humans.",2019-12-01T12:12:00Z,2024-11-30T12:11:00Z,PAR-17-245,nofo_PAR-17-245,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,CAMBRIDGE,MA,UNITED STATES,omf
R01CA234128,Highly penetrant and immunogenic mouse models of non-viral HCC that are suitable for evaluation of immune checkpoint inhibitors,"PROJECT SUMMARY This application, “Highly penetrant and immunogenic mouse models of non-viral HCC that are suitable for evaluation of immune checkpoint inhibitors”, is submitted in response to FOA PAR-17-245 “Research Projects to Enhance Applicability of Mammalian Models for Translational Research”. The goal of this project is to develop accurate, innovative, and immunogenic mouse models of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) that closely mimic the main etiologies of human non-viral HCC in their pathogenic, transcriptomic, and genomic profiles. These etiologies include non-alcoholic (NASH) and alcoholic (ASH) steatohepatitis, and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Although the current major etiologies that underlie HCC development are hepatitis virus B and C (HBV, HCV) infections, non-viral HCC is predicted to become the major form of this aggressive cancer in the US and Europe in the not too distant future. While the incidence of non-viral HCC and its associated mortality continue to grow at an alarming rate, progress in HCC treatment has been disappointingly slow. Recently, however, inhibitors of the PD-1:PD-L1 checkpoint were found to be much more effective in HCC treatment than any other targeted or non-targeted therapeutic used in the past. Nonetheless, with objective response rates around 20%, there is much room for future improvement. Such improvement depends on better understanding of how immune checkpoint inhibition leads to HCC regression and the identification of adjuvants that enhance the response to this new class of drugs. Both objectives are dependent on the availability of immunogenic mouse models of human HCC. We will bank on our recent success in developing an immunogenic mouse model of NASH-driven HCC that is responsive to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade to develop new and improved mouse models of non-viral HCC that show rapid and synchronized tumor development, making them highly useful for translational research. In addition to NASH-driven HCC, we will develop new immunogenic models of ASH-driven HCC. We will also generate a series of mouse HCC-derived cell lines that give rise to synchronized orthotopic tumors, whose growth and response to treatment can be monitored by in vivo imaging. To determine and demonstrate the human relevance of these models, they will be subjected to extensive genomic and transcriptomic characterization and immunoprofiling. The results of these analyses will be compared to the genomic and transcriptomic profiles of human HCC using innovative computational tools. The following Specific Aims will be pursued: 1) Use the MUP- uPA model of NASH driven HCC to compare the carcinogenic efficacy of different NASH-related diets; 2) Use the MUP-uPA mouse to develop new models of ASH-induced HCC that do not involve HFD feeding; 3) Compare mouse and human HCC genomic, transcriptomic, and immune profiles; and 4) Generate cell lines from the different mouse HCC models that will give rise to synchronized orthotopic tumors that are useful for drug testing.",2018-12-01T12:12:00Z,2024-11-30T12:11:00Z,PAR-17-245,nofo_PAR-17-245,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",LA JOLLA,CA,UNITED STATES,omf
R01CA234181,Credentialing a Genetically Engineered Clinically-Relevant Mouse Model of Multiple Myeloma,"Project Summary/Abstract Thalidomide (Thal) and its derivatives, Lenalidomide (Len) and Pomalidomide (POM), are immune modulatory drugs (IMiDs) used in the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM) and few other hematological malignancies. Although they represent the backbone treatment for both newly diagnosed and relapse/refractory MM patients, their clinical use remains mostly empirical because of lack of suitable in vivo model systems to study their complex mechanisms of action. Murine cells are intrinsically resistant to IMiDs because of different amino acid sequence in the IMiD binding domain of cereblon (CRBN). By building upon our extensively validated Vk*MYC transgenic mouse model of MM, we have generated a novel transgenic mouse, Vk*MYChCRBN, expressing the full human CRBN (hCRBN) gene under the control of its endogenous regulatory elements, rendering it IMiD sensitive. As previously done for the Vk*MYC model, we will extensively characterize the new Vk*MYChCRBN model and will use it to understand the IMiD effects on the tumor and the immune system with the ultimate goal to inform clinical practice.",2018-12-07T12:12:00Z,2024-11-30T12:11:00Z,PAR-17-245,nofo_PAR-17-245,MAYO CLINIC ARIZONA,SCOTTSDALE,AZ,UNITED STATES,omf
R01CA237037,Developing translationally-relevant genetically engineered mouse models of lung adenocarcinoma for investigations in cancer immunology,"Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are extending the survival of patients with advanced, metastatic cancer, across many cancer types. Remarkably, immunotherapies may be curative, yet, only a fraction of cancer pa- tients have strong durable responses to ICIs. Response rates also differ greatly between cancer types, and some ICIs are only effective against a handful of cancers. The reasons for this remain unclear, underscoring the need for further research. Many ICIs, like antibodies targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, act on tumor-specific T cells that are already fighting the cancer at the time the patient is diagnosed with disease. The therapies reinvigorate T cells and cause them to attack and sometimes destroy the cancer. Little is known about the T cells that mediate thera- peutic responses or the factors that modulate their therapeutic efficacy. Thus, there is great interest in deter- mining how these therapies work and in augmenting them so that response rates increase. Unfortunately, it has not been easy, because few animal models recapitulate the natural biology of human cancer and elicit de- tectable anti-tumor immune responses. Genetically engineered mouse (GEM) models are widely used for stud- ies in cancer biology because they allow investigators to study developing tumors and to understand how tu- mors change over the course of disease. Yet, these gold-standard models are not used for cancer immunology studies because tumors do not express neoantigens, which are required for anti-tumor T cell responses. It has been challenging to develop GEM models where tumors express neoantigens. To remedy this problem, we engineered the “NINJA” mouse, and, in this proposal, we will use NINJA to generate “immunogenic” GEM models for cancer (i.e., models that elicit anti-cancer immune responses). We will standardize immunogenic models for lung and pancreatic cancer, investigate how neoantigens alter the immune cell infiltrates into tu- mors, and confirm their translational potential as faithful mimics of human cancer. Moreover, we will develop cell line and organoid models from these immunogenic GEMs, which will greatly increase the available tools for researchers in lung and pancreatic cancer. These state-of-the-art models will allow scientists to look at lung and pancreatic tumors at early stages (before cancers would be diagnosed in a patient), and to figure out how these early tumors and immune cells interact. Moreover, our studies will validate NINJA as a platform that can be used by other investigators for the genera- tion of immunogenic GEMs for other cancer types. As these models can be used to improve responses of pa- tients to immunotherapy, NINJA will be useful for enhancing the applicability of almost any GEM model for translational research.",2020-04-01T12:04:00Z,2025-03-31T12:03:00Z,PAR-17-245,nofo_PAR-17-245,YALE UNIVERSITY,NEW HAVEN,CT,UNITED STATES,omf
R01CA237067,Development of Novel Spontaneous HPV Cervicovaginal Carcinoma Models for Cancer Immunotherapy,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The identification of human papillomavirus (HPV) as a causative agent for a host of conditions, particularly cervical cancer, has led to the development of HPV-targeting therapeutics, including therapeutic HPV vaccines, for the treatment of HPV-associated malignancies. However, the potent efficacies demonstrated by the therapeutic HPV vaccine candidates in preclinical studies are often not reflected in clinical settings. This discrepancy is potentially due to the inability of existing preclinical HPV tumor models to fully replicate the biology of clinical HPV-associated cancers. We hypothesize that an ideal preclinical HPV tumor model should possess the following characteristics: 1) forms spontaneous, localized, HPV oncogenic proteins-expressing tumors; 2) displays carcinoma morphology; 3) possesses a locally immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) resembling that of clinical HPV+ tumors; 4) tumor formation should follow clinical progression starting from a precancerous to an invasive and metastatic state; 5) be applicable to different MHC class I backgrounds; and 6) the tumor-bearing mice should respond appropriately to immunotherapeutic strategies and generate anti-tumor immunity. Preliminary data: We developed a strategy for the generation of preclinical spontaneous HPV cervicovaginal carcinoma based on orthotopic injection of oncogenic plasmids encoding HPV16-E6, HPV16-E7, constitutively active Akt, luciferase reporter gene, and Sleeping Beauty Transposase (SB) into the cervicovaginal tract of mice with electroporation to enhance transfection efficiency. Subsequent expression of SB induces the integration of plasmid DNA into the genome of transfected cells, resulting in persistent oncogenes expression and spontaneous transformation of transfected cells. In a systemic immunosuppressed setting induced by short-term anti-CD3 administration, intracervicovaginal oncogenic plasmid transfection led to the spontaneous formation of HPV+ tumors with carcinoma characteristics. We propose to further optimize our model by incorporating immunosuppressive molecules that are often overexpressed in clinical cervical cancers into our spontaneous HPV cervicovaginal tumor model and eliminate the need of short-term CD3 depletion. Also, we will further utilize genetic outbred mice and HPV16 pseudovirion delivery of oncogenes for the generation of spontaneous tumors, thereby recapitulating the genetic diverse patient population and HPV16 infection-induced oncogene introduction. Furthermore, we will examine various treatment strategies, such as the combination of therapeutic HPV vaccination with inhibitors of immunosuppressive molecules, in overcoming the immunosuppressive TME for the generation of improved therapeutic antitumor responses. Impact: A novel preclinical HPV cervicovaginal cancer model that faithfully recapitulates the clinical situation would potentiate crucial immunotherapeutic and biological research for HPV- associated cancers, provide better predictions for clinical outcomes of HPV-specific immunotherapies, and permit testing of novel molecular interventions targeting immune suppressive genes.",2019-04-01T12:04:00Z,2024-03-31T12:03:00Z,PAR-17-245,nofo_PAR-17-245,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,BALTIMORE,MD,UNITED STATES,omf
R01CA237405,Polymerase-mediated ultramutagenesis and carcinogenesis in mice,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Genetically-engineered mouse models (GEMMs) are essential tools for the study of cancer. However, there is growing concern that GEMMs fail to recapitulate the mutation burden of human carcinomas. GEMMs have startlingly low overall mutation rates, far below what is observed in their human counterparts. This makes such models useful for studies of oncogenic signaling pathways, but greatly restricts their utility for studies of genetic heterogeneity and clonal variation, tumor immunology, or the impact of mutational load/base substitution rates on tumor behavior and response to therapy. The latter has become particularly relevant with the advent of immune checkpoint therapies, given that the best predictor of treatment success is a high incidence of somatic mutations, irrespective of tumor type. The same limitations are likely to be encountered with GEMMs based on newer genome-editing methods, pointing to the need for alternative approaches to optimize with respect to mutational load, which we now know defines so many aspects of tumor biology, clinical behavior and treatment response. In this project, submitted in response to PAR-17-245 “Research Projects to Enhance Applicability of Mammalian Models for Translational Research”, we propose to generate and characterize the first mouse cancer models based on polymerase-driven ultramutation. These approaches will 1) catalyze modelling of any cancer driven by POLE ultramutagenesis and 2) permit efficient “humanization” of any GEMM with respect to mutational load. Our approach represents a new and widely-applicable route to the creation of mouse models that recapitulate the mutational loads inherent to human cancer. These new genetic tools and the diverse animal models they will enable will stimulate a wide range of translational and preclinical investigations for which GEMMs were previously not well-suited, thus fulfilling the goals of PAR-17-245.",2019-02-01T12:02:00Z,2025-01-31T12:01:00Z,PAR-17-245,nofo_PAR-17-245,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,DALLAS,TX,UNITED STATES,omf
R01CA239235,Definition of Immune Infiltrate Phenotype and DNA Damage Response Deficits Across Diverse Murine Mammary Carcinomas,"Abstract While major strides have been made in cancer treatment, the challenge remains to determine which patients will benefit most from a therapeutic regimen, which is the ultimate goal of personalized medicine. The key to choosing the most effective therapy for a given cancer is understanding the biological basis for differential outcomes and intrinsic sensitivity to cancer therapies. Almost all cancers are treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiation therapy but the emerging clinical success of immunoncology (IO) drugs whose success is predicated on the biology of the immune infiltrate requires new tactics to model optimal combinations. As cytotoxic therapy is a critical component of cancer patient treatment, mammalian models that represent a range of DNA damage response deficits (DDRD), and hence sensitivity to different agents, would improve translational research. Likewise, the multiple mechanisms by which cancer evades the anti- tumor immunity need to be represented in translational research. Lack of diversity in most current preclinical models limits their applicability as a platform for systemic evaluation of these aspects of tumor biology. Given the range of IO approaches and the diversity of DDRD, a critical unmet translational requirement is a model system in which both the tumor DDRD and the immune infiltrate is defined so that combinations can be readily studied. We propose to use murine tumor derived transplants (mTDT) of Trp53 null mammary carcinomas that we have generated and characterized in regard to heterogeneity, relevance to human cancer, and reproducibility to credential the DDR deficits of these syngeneic carcinomas and to evaluate corresponding baseline immune cell infiltrates. We will implement multiplex analysis of tumor and immune features and correlate them with tumor response to radiation, a canonical DNA damaging therapy and arguably the most widely used cytotoxic therapy. The product of these studies is directly responsive to the FOA consisting of a protocol for standardized implementation of this model, comprehensive analysis of tumor types, and repository of specimens, data, and viable tissue. The success of this project will provide a means to conduct mechanistic and translational studies using defined tumor DDRD and immune infiltrate composition for developing patient- specific personalized therapy to IO and cytotoxic therapies.",2019-04-01T12:04:00Z,2024-03-31T12:03:00Z,PAR-17-245,nofo_PAR-17-245,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",SAN FRANCISCO,CA,UNITED STATES,omf
R01CA239701,Admixture analysis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in African American children: the ADMIRAL Study,"Modified Project Summary/Abstract Section Abstract Children with substantial African ancestry have long been known to have half or less the rate of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) than do children with other continental ancestries. This is true both in international comparisons of rates of ALL in African nations to those elsewhere, and in comparing rate of B-ALL in African-American (AA) children to that in European-American (EA) children in the United States. The inverse association of African ancestry with incidence of B-ALL is independent of established perinatal risk factors for the disease. Moreover, AA children have lower incidence despite having greater exposure to many putatively causal environmental risk factors for B-ALL than do EA children. Common genetic variants established by genomewide association studies incompletely explain the deficit of B-ALL in AA children, suggesting undiscovered contributing genetic factors may be detected by admixture mapping. We have assembled existing DNA samples and data for 930 B-ALL patients with AA ancestry and will additionally accrue ~590 over the life of the project. We will conduct admixture mapping in the assembled group of patients to detect new genetic loci and new variants at established loci associated with occurrence of B-ALL. In addition, we will examine admixture in association with clinical characteristics at diagnosis and survival. Candidate genes/variants will be functionally evaluated through both in silico and in vitro techniques. The proposed research will potentially answer a long- standing mystery by revealing critical genes or loci that explain the comparative deficit of B-ALL in AA compared to EA children. In addition, we may uncover genes or variants associated with the worse characteristics at presentation in AA patients as well as with worse survival, which will indicate avenues for improving outcome among AA children.",2020-08-01T12:08:00Z,2025-07-31T12:07:00Z,PA-19-056;PA-20-272;PA-21-071,award_R01CA239701,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,MINNEAPOLIS,MN,UNITED STATES,admiral
R01CA243456,Radiogenomic Credentialing of Head and Neck Cancer Models,"Abstract Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) are aggressive neoplasms that result in debilitating changes in speech, appearance, and quality of life in humans. Response rates in HNSCC patients have remained relatively unchanged over the years, especially in patients with human papillomavirus (HPV) negative HNSCC highlighting the critical need for novel strategies to meet the therapeutic needs of this patient population. As recognized by PAR-17-245, a critical step in discovering novel therapies for HNSCC patients is the development of tumor models that can reliably recapitulate human disease biology, heterogeneity and therapeutic response. The overall goal of this application is to validate and credential a panel of patient- derived and immunocompetent models of HNSCC. Systematic and in-depth comparison of histopathologic, genomic, and therapeutic response profiles will be performed across multiple preclinical platforms in vitro (organoids) and in vivo (allografts/xenografts). Paired in vitro and in vivo models across these platforms will be used to assess their response to standard of care chemoradiation and immune checkpoint blockade. The models will also be used to screen the activity of novel and FDA-approved agents (‘drug repurposing’) targeting critical pathways implicated in the pathogenesis of HNSCC. The application builds on an existing collaboration between several investigators at Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center with extensive experience and expertise in mammalian models, head and neck cancer, cancer imaging, tumor immunology, genomics, bioinformatics and cancer therapeutics. The project will employ innovative multimodal functional imaging methods to better define and enhance the true translational utility of mammalian models.

R01CA243555,Development of Advanced Preclinical Models for Pediatric Solid Tumors,"PROJECT SUMMARY Pediatric solid tumors are a rare and highly heterogeneous collection of cancers. For many subtypes, progress in defining novel therapies has stalled over the last 10-20 years. Indeed, for most of these tumors chemotherapy continues to be the primary form of treatment and targeted therapies are not available. This lack of progress is likely due at least in part to the difficulty in developing clinical trials for individual histologic subtypes given their rarity. An alternative is to develop a robust preclinical testing program. Currently, such programs are limited by the lack of well-credentialed models that incorporate the most advanced technologies for genomic and functional characterization and do to the lack of good models for therapy-resistant and metastatic disease. Here we bring together two PIs with complimentary expertise to develop new approaches for validation and preclinical use of pediatric solid tumor animal models. Our focus is on the use of patient- derived xenografts for three most common histotypes: osteosarcoma, ewing sarcoma and rhabdomyosarcoma. PDX models are particularly well suited for studying highly heterogeneous tumors such as pediatric solid tumors. In Aim 1, we will develop novel advance PDX models that incorporate two key innovations: i) utilization of CRISPR/CAS9 technology for genetic interrogation and ii) autologous and allogeneic approaches for development of PDX models with a human immune system (hu-PDX). In Aim 2, we will develop novel computational tools to assess the similarity of PDX models to their tumor of origin and to evaluate human- mouse and mouse-mouse evolution which may impact clinical relevance. We will work closely with members of the Oncology Models Forum to develop scoring systems to assess this similarity and make these tools widely available to the modeling community. In Aim 3, we will evaluate intratumor heterogeneity during human-mouse and mouse-mouse evolution of PDX models using single cell RNAseq. We expect that the tools and models developed here will be widely applicable to other PDX models and that the specific models we develop will help facilitate preclinical research. We will make all tools and models widely accessible to the research community.",2020-03-05T12:03:00Z,2025-02-28T12:02:00Z,PAR-17-245,nofo_PAR-17-245,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",SAN FRANCISCO,CA,UNITED STATES,omf
R01CA244327,Novel Transgenic Mouse Models Addressing Outstanding Translational Barriers in Antibody-Based Therapeutics,"ABSTRACT Monoclonal antibodies have played a pivotal role in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer for nearly two decades and continue to grow at an exponential pace. Initially developed for their exceptional ability to target tumor antigens and elicit antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), they have more recently been used to modulate a patient’s immune system for anti-cancer immunotherapy. While the generation and development of antibodies targeting various cell surface proteins has rapidly progressed, appropriate model systems for pre- clinical testing of such therapeutics has lagged. This is because human antibodies i) don’t fully engage murine or non-human primate Fc receptors (FcγRs), ii) are foreign proteins that are rapidly rejected in allogeneic hosts and iii) are often inappropriately tested in immunodeficient xenograft models lacking adaptive immune cells or homologous FcγR. Thus, our studies have focused on the generation and testing of clinically relevant models to better understand the in vivo activity of diagnostic and therapeutic antibodies. The current proposal aims to now generate and fully characterize novel murine models that allow better preclinical testing of human antibodies by engineering our previously developed humanized FcγR mouse strains to express human FcRn and IgG1. Expression of human FcRn will allow more accurate pharmacokinetic analysis of human antibodies and assessment of methods aimed at generating antibodies with extended in vivo half-life. By replacing the mouse heavy chain with the constant regions of human IgG1, this model will also allow chronic administration of human IgG-based therapeutics without developing anti-drug antibody responses. By addressing two major hurdles in the field of antibody therapeutics, these models will allow more rapid and efficient pre-clinical toxicology testing and potentially uncover novel mechanisms of Fc-engineered antibodies. Additionally, given the growing interest in immunotherapy, having an immunocompetent model provides an additional advantage over current xenograft models. Finally, as recent data suggest an important role for Fc-FcγR in radiolabeled antibody diagnostics, these models will provide a clinically relevant model to help improve the development and testing of innovative antibody-based molecules for the in vivo detection and localization of neoplasms.",2020-07-07T12:07:00Z,2025-06-30T12:06:00Z,PAR-17-245,nofo_PAR-17-245,ROCKEFELLER UNIVERSITY,NEW YORK,NY,UNITED STATES,omf
R01CA246653,Mouse models of Kras-mutant colorectal cancer,"Project Summary/Abstract Colorectal cancer (CRC) kills more than 50,000 Americans each year. Fluorouracil-based therapy remains the standard of care and there have been no targeted therapies approved for use in CRC in the past half decade. Mutational activation of the KRAS oncogene – which occurs more than in 40% of cases – is a major source of intrinsic and acquired resistance to both conventional and targeted therapies in CRC. Since there are no effective therapies that directly or indirectly target K-Ras or its downstream effector pathways, KRAS mutation is the single greatest barrier to medical treatment for CRC. Large scale sequencing of cancer genomes has revealed that, among those 40% of CRCs that express mutant K-Ras, the diversity of KRAS alleles is greater than in any other type of cancer. Epidemiological studies demonstrate that survival and response to therapy varies depending on the KRAS genotype of the patient's cancer, suggesting that different mutant forms of the K-Ras oncoprotein could exhibit distinct oncogenic properties. Experimental validation of allele-specific behaviors has never been achieved, however. We will use primary human and mouse organoids and genetically engineered mouse models to address three key questions relating to K-Ras oncogenicity: (1) Are different mutant forms of K-Ras equivalent in their ability to promote colorectal cancer initiation and progression? (2) Are genetic interactions between KRAS and other genes allele-specific? (3) How do mutant forms of K-Ras influence the tumor microenvironment in a non-cell- autonomous manner to promote cancer progression? The ultimate goal of this work is to decipher the “KRAS Allele Code” in order to identify therapeutic strategies that are effective for cancers expressing specific K-Ras mutants. Precision medicine, where a physician tailors a patient's therapy to the genes that are mutated in his/her cancer, requires this level of understanding, especially for mutant oncoprotein that, like K-Ras, cannot be targeted with direct inhibitors.",2020-07-01T12:07:00Z,2025-06-30T12:06:00Z,PAR-17-245,nofo_PAR-17-245,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,BOSTON,MA,UNITED STATES,omf
R01CA246722,Myeloid cells and radiation-induced memory deficits in rodent glioma model: sex and age effects,"Project Summary/Abstract Ionizing irradiation is commonly used to treat both primary and metastatic brain tumors and can cause a number of late effects including progressive cognitive dysfunction. These cognitive changes are particularly severe in individuals who were treated with radiation during childhood. The extent and nature of the resulting cognitive deficits may be influenced by age, treatment and gender . The neurobiological reason for this difference is unknown, and very few experimental studies have addressed this issue. Ionizing radiation in rodents has been consistently shown to activate several neuroinflammatory signaling cascades that can impact multiple neural processes and synaptic transmission, ultimately disrupting hippocampal function. Neuroinflammation, characterized by activation of brain resident microglia and recruitment of peripherally derived monocytes (collectively referred to as `myeloid cells'), has been consistently associated with the loss of cognitive function in mice after radiation. There are still no treatments for preventing or treating radiation-induced cognitive dysfunction. Despite the extensive clinical evidence linking fractionated brain irradiation with cognitive deficits, there are still unanswered gaps in the biologic basis of this observation: the mechanism/s by which activation of the inflammatory response affect cognitive function, and the effect of age and sex. Furthermore, there are no pre-clinical models that recapitulate the features of the most common clinical scenario: patients with central nervous system (CNS) tumors. Our final therapeutic goal is to prevent and treat the cognitive changes observed after fractionated whole-brain irradiation (fWBI) injury. We hypothesize that changes in the composition and function of myeloid cells following brain irradiation can both prevent and rescue cognitive deficits through durable effects on synapses. The translational objective of this proposal is to demonstrate that resetting the immune system by brief microglia depletion prevents the long-term development of memory deficits in a brain tumor model designed to mimic conventional treatment paradigms used in clinical settings. The specific aims in support of our hypothesis are: 1. Establish the effects of fWBI on memory and synaptic composition as a function of age and sex in an immunocompetent mouse glioma model. 2. Determine the role of myeloid cells in the development of fWBI-induced memory deficits. 3. Evaluate the role of myeloid cells as a mechanistic driver of the permanent memory deficits after fWBI. Very little is known in regard to the evolution of radiation induced pathophysiology in the context of peripherally derived macrophage accumulation or inflammation, and how this relates to altered synaptic and cognitive function. Our final therapeutic goal is to modify the cognitive changes observed after radiation injury.",2020-07-01T12:07:00Z,2025-06-30T12:06:00Z,PAR-17-245,nofo_PAR-17-245,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",SAN FRANCISCO,CA,UNITED STATES,omf
R01CA247905,Modeling the Glioblastoma Microenvironment to Uncover Progression Mechanisms and Therapeutic Targets,"In nearly all forms of human cancer, the development of necrosis is tightly linked with malignant progression. Whether necrosis accelerates progression or is largely passive remains an open question, yet modeling these events to establish mechanisms and therapeutic vulnerabilities in animals has been challenging. In glioblastoma (GBM; WHO grade IV), the most malignant primary brain tumor, the rapid, radial growth phase that leads quickly to death is consistently preceded by the development of central necrosis. While genetic alterations of GBM are known in great detail, the biological properties that result from their acquisition and lead to this accelerated growth phase require deeper investigation. The tumor microenvironment (TME) changes dramatically following the onset of necrosis, from a sheet-like growth of infiltrating cells with relatively constant growth properties to a highly complex and evolving 3-D microsystem composed of diverse cell types and spatially segregated signaling networks. To better understand the dynamic temporal and spatial changes that promote progression, we propose to advance mouse models that closely parallel these events in human gliomas, since many mouse models of GBM lack necrosis. We developed a novel method to induce focal necrosis within high grade gliomas in vivo and will study TME restructuring and its impact on glioma growth in real time using multiphoton microscopy. As translational applications, we will demonstrate how hypoxia and necrosis promote the enrichment of glioma stem cells (GSCs) in their peri-necrotic niche and lead to the dramatic influx of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), which increase in number over 10-fold in the human disease. We propose both genetically characterized patient-derived GBM xenografts grown in mice with humanized immune cells, as well as an immunocompetent RCAS/tv-a model, and will determine how antagonizing these processes impact disease progression and outcomes. Our preliminary data and the literature indicate substantial differences between pre-necrotic and necrotic gliomas with regard to GSC and TAM enrichment and their impact on biological properties, but the mechanisms and evolution have not been studied in depth, in large part due to the absence of a credible animal model. Our model will capture glioma growth dynamics, GSC enrichment, and TAM influx, and facilitate the development of therapies that antagonize these mechanisms to improve outcomes.",2020-05-01T12:05:00Z,2025-04-30T12:04:00Z,PAR-17-245,nofo_PAR-17-245,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,CHICAGO,IL,UNITED STATES,omf
R01CA247970,"A Novel Adenoviral-Permissive, Immunocompetent Hamster Model to Evaluate Oncolytic Adenoviral Therapy for Glioblastoma","Despite oncolytic adenoviruses emerging as promising new therapeutics for patients with glioblastoma (GBM), there are no translational mammalian models in an immune competent animal that are permissive to adenoviral infection and that allow for integration of both the oncolytic and immune effects of these viruses. The overall objectives of this proposal are to develop and characterize a Golden hamster model of GBM that addresses the limitations of existing murine models with respect to pre-clinical testing of oncolytic adenoviral therapy. The central hypothesis is that hamster GBM models will provide reliable pre-clinical data to decipher oncolytic adenoviral therapeutic mechanisms and to evaluate preclinical strategies for translation to patients. The rationale for the proposed research is that understanding the interactions between viral oncolysis and the immune system will uncover mechanisms of therapeutic efficacy, identify which patients might respond best, and reveal new combinatorial therapeutic approaches. The central hypothesis will be tested in three specific aims: 1) Develop hamster glioma stem cell (hamGSC) lines that reflect common molecular alteration in human glioma, 2) Characterize the hamster immune response to oncolytic adenovirus, and 3) Evaluate the effects of pharmacological manipulation of the immune system on the efficacy of Delta-24-RGD. In Aim 1, CRISPR gene targeting will be used to create hamGSC lines driven by specific driver alterations to reflect human GBM molecular subtypes. In Aim 2, the immune response to oncolytic adenovirus will be characterized. Using T-cell depletions strategies, the contributions of immune effector cells to oncolytic virus efficacy and long-term immune memory and the impacts of pre-existing exposure to adenovirus will be evaluated. Aim 3 will evaluate the effects of immune function via either corticosteroids or immune checkpoint inhibitors on oncolytic adenovirus therapeutic efficacy. Collectively, the studies proposed in this application will result in the development and characterization of a novel mammalian model for translational evaluation of oncolytic adenovirus in the treatment of GBM. This contribution is significant because it will overcome many limitations of mouse glioma models and for the first time provide a platform for pre-clinical studies to evaluate the efficacy and mechanisms of oncolytic adenoviral therapy against GBM. The proposed research is innovative because this is the first hamster glioma model that is intracranial, immune competent, and adenoviral replication permissive. This represents a distinct advantage over traditional murine models, particularly in the setting of evaluating immune-modulating therapies such as oncolytic adenoviral therapy.",2020-04-01T12:04:00Z,2025-03-31T12:03:00Z,PAR-17-245,nofo_PAR-17-245,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,HOUSTON,TX,UNITED STATES,omf
R01CA248277,"Advancing Precision Oncology in a Humanized, Fully Autologous Mouse Model","Progress in the early detection and treatment of cancer requires accurate model systems to further evaluate new, promising discoveries. Small animal, and in particular mouse, model systems are attractive to researchers for numerous reasons, including their ease of use and well-described platforms. Immunotherapy has revolutionized clinical oncology, but lacks pre-clinical models of the human immune system and human cancer to investigate new modalities and limitations/toxicities of treatment regimens. The ability to grow human tumors in immune-deficient mice (so-called patient-derived xenografts, or PDXs) allows researchers to work directly with human cancer tissue in a controlled setting. However, PDX models are limited by their lack of an intact immune system. The broad objective of this proposal is to validate an in vivo model to evaluate human tumors in the context of a complete and intact human immune system in a completely personalized and autologous fashion to study cancer immunotherapy. Herein, we propose to: (1) validate the ability of our humanized system to serve as a model for cancer immunotherapy treatment response and toxicity in patients with melanoma, including immunotherapy checkpoint blockade and vaccine strategies, and to (2) extend our current work in melanoma by validating the ability to establish humanized mice and evaluate tumor growth and leukocyte development in autologous human pancreatic and colorectal tumors established in humanized mice. In each of these areas, we will leverage our multi-institutional team's individual expertise along with our institutional infrastructure to maximize the success of the experimental aims. The results from this project will made widely available to the general research community for future, hypothesis-driven research. Taken together, the studies described in this research proposal will meet multiple goals and address several unmet needs identified in this grant opportunity, thus significantly enhancing the applicability of a fully autologous and immunocompetent precision model system for use in translational oncology research.",2020-03-01T12:03:00Z,2025-02-28T12:02:00Z,PAR-17-245,nofo_PAR-17-245,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,SAINT LOUIS,MO,UNITED STATES,omf
R01CA248280,Rapid ex vivo biosensor cultures to assess dependencies in gastroesophageal cancer,"The ability to predict dependencies given the molecular features of a patient’s tumor is central to cancer precision medicine. The systematic use of CRISPR/Cas9 and pharmacologic tools in established cancer models is showing great potential to discover new targets. However, existing model development approaches require long periods of culture time during which evolutionary pressures reduce heterogeneity. And, it remains challenging to create long-term models for certain tumor types and genotypes, making it challenging to use perturbational tools to experimentally map dependencies. To address these challenges, our overarching goal is to develop ‘rapid ex vivo tumor biosensors’ whereby we would be able to interrogate cancer dependencies in an immediate short-term ‘culture’ of cancer cells taken from a patient biopsy/surgery/fluid collection as a novel research-grade experimental model of cancer. In doing so, we aim to couple the timing of drug or CRISPR/Cas9 perturbation with the preservation of subcellular heterogeneity. If successful, we hypothesize that this modelling approach will more accurately recapitulate patient tumors and may ultimately serve as a stronger foundation for preclinical therapeutic studies. This work should also substantially expand the fraction of patient samples that can be interrogated. Here, we propose using gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma (GEA) as a test case for this strategy due to our experience as well as the existence of marked intra-tumor heterogeneity. However, once established, this novel modeling platform should enable a wide range of basic and translational questions (both for GEA and other tumors) that require model formats that include heterogeneous cell populations. Our goal will be achieved via two Specific Aims including (1) using patient-derived organoids created on rapid time frames for CRISPR/Cas9 editing to validate emerging GEA dependencies; and (2) developing the ability to directly visualize and perturb single cells from matching patient ascites fluid or disaggregated primary tumors ex vivo using label-free imaging methods. We will benchmark these approaches against each other using the same clinically annotated, serially collected patient samples. In following the instructions for this RFP, we focus on technology-development focused goals as opposed to deeper mechanistic studies. We focus on benchmarking predictions and assessing reproducibility, sensitivity and specificity. This work is innovative, in that it brings together expertise at the intersection of functional genomics, advanced computational approaches for image-analysis and GEA genomics. If successful, this effort could have significant impact by establishing a foundation to expand this approach to other disease (tumor and non-cancer) indications.",2020-04-01T12:04:00Z,2025-03-31T12:03:00Z,PAR-17-245,nofo_PAR-17-245,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,CAMBRIDGE,MA,UNITED STATES,omf
R01CA251141,New mouse model of cisplatin-induced AKI and development of prevention therapy,"SUMMARY Cisplatin is among the most widely used drugs against solid tumors, but it can cause severe damage of renal tubulointerstitial tissues, manifesting itself pathologically in the form of glomerular filtration rate reduction, hype- ruricemia, hypokalemia, and accelerated secondary glomerulosclerosis and glomerular ischemia. The end re- sult is acute kidney injury (AKI). Cisplatin induces AKI, which afflicts 25% of cisplatin-treated cancer patients worldwide. With few exceptions, there is no effective preventive or post-exposure therapy for cisplatin-induced AKI (C-AKI). Oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage are drivers of AKI-associated pathology; however, the molecular pathways that mediate these events are poorly defined. Using murine C-AKI model kidney and bi- opsy samples from C-AKI patients, we have recently found that both oxidative stress and mitochondrial dam- age are associated with upregulation of renal apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 2 (APE2). In preliminary ex- periments, we discovered that cisplatin exposure in vivo increases expression of APE2 in mice and inhibits the action of the protein myosin heavy chain 9 (MYH9), a key regulatory molecule of kidney function. These altera- tions translate into impact on tubulointerstitial tissue. Our overall working hypothesis is that cisplatin alters kidney APE2 signaling, leading to inhibition of MYH9 with concomitant tubulointerstitial damage. Here we pro- pose to more precisely illuminate the target role of APE2 in AKI development, and specifically hypothesize (i) that highly expressed APE2 affects mtDNA integrity and MYH9/actin intermediate mitochondrial fission and (ii) that this in turn promotes renal injury by triggering cell-death pathways. To address these dual issues, we propose using APE2 transgenic and knockout (KO) mouse models to pursue the two Specific Aims detailed below. In Aim 1, we will validate a genetically engineered murine model of APE2 with direct clinical relevance to C-AKI. We will comprehensively define the APE2 mouse phenotype and compare it with that of the C-AKI mouse model and the human C-AKI signature with respect to pathophysiological features at the molecular level using whole genomic, transcriptional, and immunomic approaches. We will define the binding site of APE2/MYH9 and its functional significance for further translational studies. In Aim 2, we will conduct proof-of- concept studies on APE2 targeted therapy for prevention of C-AKI. Additionally, we will define a novel targeted therapy to prevent nephrotoxicity by delivering APE2 gapmer antisense oligonucleotides or small-molecule in- hibitors to selectively suppress APE2 expression in proximal tubule cells in APE2 transgenic and C-AKI mice. Impact: Accomplishing these Specific Aims will be the first step toward constructing a temporal-mechanistic map of events that occur upon cisplatin exposure and translate into tubulointerstitial nephritis and may ulti- mately enable development of novel targeted therapy for AKI disease.",2021-08-01T12:08:00Z,2026-07-31T12:07:00Z,PAR-20-131,nofo_PAR-20-131,CLEVELAND CLINIC LERNER COM-CWRU,CLEVELAND,OH,UNITED STATES,omf
R01CA251393,Lentiviral-Induced Swine Model of Spinal Cord Glioma,"PROJECT SUMMARY High-grade Spinal Cord Glioma (SCG) is an orphan disease that results in significant morbidity and mortality, with no effective treatment options available. Despite significant advances in our knowledge of the disease process, there have unfortunately been limited changes to the clinical outcomes. In part, this represents the malignant nature of a disease that is refractory to the standard of care. On the other hand, this raises the question of the translational value of existing preclinical animal models, especially from a surgical standpoint – where widely scalable large animal models of SCG were previously unavailable. To this end, the Boulis and Canoll laboratories partnered to begin addressing this gap in the field by developing a minipig SCG model. Through lentiviral targeting of the well implicated RTK/RAS/PI3K and p53 pathways, our preliminary data demonstrates the induction of high-grade astrocytoma with histopathologic, radiologic, and transcriptomic characterization in 100% of minipigs. Consequently, we posit that the next steps to advancement of this model system are to modulate tumor phenotype and to demonstrate its utility in a directly translatable surgical application. In the enclosed proposal, we will begin by evaluating the induction of SCG by targeting common genetic lesions implicated in the human disease including PDGFB, P53, CDKN2A, EGFR, and PTEN (AIM 1). This represents the opportunity to produce highly characterized SCG lesions for therapeutic testing in an immunocompetent, more anatomically relevant, large animal model. In parallel, we will apply our existing minipig SCG model (AIM 2) to perform the first intra-tumoral convection enhanced delivery (CED) study for SCG in a large animal. Rodent studies of chemotherapeutic CED for SCG have reported suppression of tumor growth and amelioration of neurologic deficits. However, these data cannot be readily scaled for translation due to anatomic limitations of rodent systems. Despite an ongoing Phase I human trial for CED in SCG, drug distribution and CED parameters are poorly understood. Indeed, failures of CED in human trials for intracranial glioma can be attributed to both ineffective drug distribution and single treatments. As such, our study will employ implanted pumps for prolonged intratumoral CED. We will investigate parameters (flow rate, volume of infusion) to evaluate optimal readouts (volume of distribution, reflux, safety, radiologic vs chemotherapeutic distribution). These data will have immediate translational impact on present and future trials.",2021-06-01T12:06:00Z,2026-05-31T12:05:00Z,PAR-20-131,nofo_PAR-20-131,EMORY UNIVERSITY,ATLANTA,GA,UNITED STATES,omf
R01CA251928,Improving hepatocellular carcinoma mouse modeling by understanding the malignant potential and biology of liver cell subpopulations,"PROJECT SUMMARY Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fastest growing cause of cancer-related death in the United States and one of the leading causes of death in patients with cirrhosis – the end result of any chronic liver injury. HCC is difficult to treat and outcomes have barely improved over the last 30 years, with 5-year survival under 20% and an incidence-to-mortality ratio near 1. Innovative strategies for detection, prevention, and treatment for HCC are desperately needed, the development of which will depend heavily on mouse models of liver cancer. The current models are inadequate because they do not take into account the cells of origin, which will likely have a significant impact on tumor initiation, maintenance, and therapeutic vulnerabilities. While the liver is appreciated for being a central metabolic hub and for its astounding regenerative capacity, cellular heterogeneity in the liver is mostly unexplored. Along the portal to central axis within the hepatic lobule, profound differences in gene expression, metabolism, hypoxia, and ploidy are observed. Whether or not these differences reflect differences in neoplastic potential, and whether or not they influence metabolic disease or carcinogenesis, is unclear. In recent years, there has been intense controversy about whether or not there is a liver stem/progenitor cell. To compound these debates, the injury assays used to drive HCC development often do not model common etiologies such as non- alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which is emerging as the most common cause of cirrhosis in the U.S. We posit that a critical problem for HCC modeling is a lack of understanding of how different cell types contribute to cancer in the context of clinically relevant injuries. We believe that identifying the specific cellular subtypes that give rise to HCC and then being able to genetically perturb these cells is critical for us to better model HCC. Unfortunately, the field does not have mouse reagents to manipulate much of the heterogeneity in the liver. To address this, my lab has optimized CRISPR genome-editing methods to rapidly generate lineage tracing mice. Nine new CreER knock-in models that label different zone-specific and progenitor populations have been produced, effectively quadrupling the number of CreER lines available to our field. We will use these tools to trace and genetically manipulate cell types in a systematic fashion in order to identify the most important regenerative cell populations (Aim 1) and the HCC cell(s) of origin (Aim 2) in the context of clinically-relevant chemical and nutritional injuries. We will then ask if cell type specific gene manipulation of common HCC driver genes will help to uncover different transformation competencies between hepatocyte subpopulations (Aim 3). Success in this project will provide the community with a large panel of important CreER tools, allow the field to focus on important subpopulations that are more likely to transform, and reveal pathways that control tumor development in these cells.",2020-06-01T12:06:00Z,2025-05-31T12:05:00Z,PAR-17-245,nofo_PAR-17-245,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,DALLAS,TX,UNITED STATES,omf
R01CA251930,Development of 3-dimensional human pituitary corticotroph tumor cultures as a preclinical model for drug discovery,"Abstract Cushing Disease (CD) is a life-threatening “orphan disease” caused by an adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-secreting pituitary adenoma driving excess adrenal cortisol production. There is a large unmet medical need for CD treatment. However, translational research has been greatly hampered due to unavailability of any human pituitary corticotroph tumor cell models. Using single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNAseq) and microarray transcriptome analysis of surgically resected human corticotroph tumors, we observed that loss of pituitary corticotroph tumor ACTH secretion coincided with reduced angiogenesis, survival signals and immune responses in parallel with increased collagen catabolism, cell adhesion and extracellular matrix organization. Guided by these findings, we developed a unique 3-dimensional (3D) pituitary tumor culture system and for the first time, we have been able to generate 3D human corticotroph tumor cultures that secrete ACTH >4 months. We have assembled an experienced multidisciplinary team to complete 3 focused specific aims using this first of its kind resource. Firstly, we will use whole exome sequencing to characterize the genomic landscape of our corticotroph 3D culture biobank and compare genomic and genetic fidelity between the original corticotroph tumor, normal blood and matched 3D corticotroph tumoroid cultures from the same individual patient. ScRNAseq analysis of serial passages of individual patient-derived corticotroph tumor cultures will monitor for transcriptome changes in a temporal fashion over the course of culture. The histopathological structure of our 3D corticotroph cultures at the single cell level will quantify tissue architecture so we can map corticotroph tumoroid cellular composition and distribution. A second aim will employ a miniaturized automated system to conduct a high throughput drug screen in our 3D corticotroph tumor cultures. Compounds will be subjected to rigorous evaluation to define primary “hits” and validated by re-screening in triplicate using 20 concentrations from 100µM to 20pM (2-fold dilution) to reliably calculate an EC50 for each compound. Finally, three complementary approaches, computational cheminformatic profiling, scRNAseq to delineate transcriptomic changes at the single cell level following drug treatment and functional genomics will be employed to explore the MOA of validated hit compounds. This integrated interrogation of our drug screen results and the genetic features of our patient-derived 3D tumor cultures as well as that of the original tumor tissue, will allow us to disentangle an individual drug's mode(s) of action, and directly document drug sensitivity of individualized parental corticotroph tumors. In summary, we will use our unique biobank of comprehensively molecularly characterized pituitary corticotroph tumor tissues and paired derived 3D corticotroph tumor cultures to test libraries of clincially relevant compounds. This pituitary 3D tumor culture system is transformative in the field due to the lack of any human pituitary corticotroph tumor cell models and will pave the path for much needed improved therapy for patients with this dreadfully disabling and often fatal disorder, Cushing disease.",2021-07-09T12:07:00Z,2026-06-30T12:06:00Z,PAR-20-131,nofo_PAR-20-131,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,LOS ANGELES,CA,UNITED STATES,omf
R01CA252378,Credentialing Models of Invasive Lobular Breast Cancer for Translational Research,"Invasive lobular breast cancer (ILC) is the second most common histological subtype of breast cancer after the more common invasive ductal breast cancer (IDC). In 2020, ILC will affect up to 40,000 patients in the US, and if considered an independent malignancy is the 6th most frequent cancer in women. Loss of E-cadherin (CDH1) is the pathognomonic feature of ILC, which leads to a single-file pattern infiltration of small discohesive cells into the stroma. Patients with ILC suffer from late recurrences and metastasis to unique sites such as the urogenital tract (e.g. ovary) and the gastrointestinal (GI) tract (e.g. peritoneum). Despite numerous studies showing unique clinical, histopathological, and molecular features of ILC, clinical trials and guidelines mostly ignore the unique aspects of ILC, and treat IDC and ILC as a single disease. Our long-term goal is to improve outcome for patients with ILC, a disease associated with limited understanding and representing a great unmet clinical need. ILC is currently understudied at least in part due to a lack of credentialed models and it is currently unclear which ILC models are most appropriate to test clinically meaningful questions. We will collaborate with the Cancer Dependency Map Project (DepMap - CCLE) and members of PDXNet to comprehensively credential ILC models. We have established a team with complementary expertise in ILC biology, rodent modeling, bioinformatics, immunology, pathology, medical oncology, and breast cancer advocacy and will use innovative validation strategies to cross-compare in vitro and in vivo translational ILC models. Our goal is to create a robust set of well-curated models that are credentialed to provide translationally reliable information for evaluating targeted therapies in primary and metastatic ILC. In Aim 1 we will molecularly characterize ILC models and compare them to human ILC. This will include 19 ILC or ‘ILC-like’ cell lines, 20 primary ILC organoids, 8 patient derived xenografts, 2 homograft rodent models and 3 genetically engineered mouse models (GEMM). We will assess histopathology and perform comprehensive genomic, epigenomic and transcriptomic analyses. In Aim 2 we will focus on in vitro growth phenotypes and in vivo metastasis to determine which models recapitulate the unique growth pattern seen in human ILC. Since we have recently sequenced unique sites of ILC metastasis (ovary, GI) in the human disease, we will compare the molecular profile of our metastasis models to human ILC metastasis. Finally, Aim 3 will focus on therapeutic efficacy. We will work with the Broad Institute to perform CRISPR and drug screening on ILC cell lines and organoids and make all data available in the DepMap portal. In vivo we will assess endocrine therapy response in homografts and compare the results to an ongoing ILC clinical trial led by our group. We will also characterize the immune cell infiltrate and response to checkpoint inhibitors in homograft rodent ILC models in order to assess their suitability for the study of therapies targeting the immune system.",2021-04-01T12:04:00Z,2026-03-31T12:03:00Z,PAR-20-131,nofo_PAR-20-131,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,PITTSBURGH,PA,UNITED STATES,omf
R01CA252713,Canine MHC-I genotyping and tumor specific neoantigen determination,"Abstract Being naturally occurring and with an intact immune system, spontaneous cancers in pet dogs have the potential to effectively bridge a current gap between preclinical models and human clinical trials, advancing cancer immunotherapy. However, a current lack of essential resources creates roadblocks to the effective use of canine cancers. The deficiency is clearly seen in predicting tumor-specific neoantigen (TSNA), attractive targets in cancer treatment and prevention. TSNAs arise when intracellular mutant peptides, created by cancer-associated somatic alterations, are presented by the cell’s histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) molecules. Hence, MHC-I genotyping is a prerequisite for TSNA prediction. However, with few MHC-I alleles known to date, MHC-I genotyping for the dog is a significant challenge. Moreover, because of the very limited MHC-I protein crystal structures and experimental peptide binding data, there currently lack public tools to predict TSNAs specifically for the dog, in contrast to the human with many tools developed. With the next generation sequencing (NGS) data published for thousands of dogs from hundreds of breeds, now is the time to address these deficiencies. We propose to combine our expertise, NGS data analysis by the Zhao (PI) lab and MHC-I characterization by the Hildebrand (MPI) lab, to develop software tools and data resources for large scale MHC-I genotyping and systematic TSNA prediction for the dog. We will also genotype MHC-I alleles of thousands of dogs sequenced and predict TSNAs for hundreds of canine tumors characterized. We will use our proposed MHC-I genotype and TSNA discovery tools to assist a NCI-funded immunotherapy trial via collaboration with Dr. Steven Dow, and the Vaccination Against Canine Cancer Study (VACCS) trial via collaboration with Dr. Douglas Thamm. By establishing resources that are critically missing at present, our work will significantly enhance the applicability of the dog model for translational research.",2021-05-11T12:05:00Z,2026-04-30T12:04:00Z,PAR-20-131,nofo_PAR-20-131,UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA,ATHENS,GA,UNITED STATES,omf
R01CA253981,Modeling myelodysplasia,"PROJECT SUMMARY Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) are a cancer of the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) on the rise in the aging population and cancer survivors. The only curative treatment for MDS is allogeneic stem cell transplantation with marked limitations in the majority of MDS patients. As a result, standard-of-care focuses on hypomethylating agents (HMA) azacytidine (AZA) and decitabine (DAC), which invariably result in resistance and disease progression. There is a dire need for new therapeutics; however, there are no robust models of MDS to accelerate preclinical testing. We have generated a breakthrough humanized xenograft-recipient mouse model which eliminates conditioning and facilitates engraftment of primary MDS. We will validate the model by single-cell genetic and genomic characterization of diagnostic MDS patient material before therapy and of the same cells engrafted in humanized mice, clearly dellineating the transcriptional impact of xenografting. Next, we will establish pharmacodynamic endpoints for AZA within the mouse model and apply the empirically-derived dose of AZA to the model. Human MDS material will be captured for single cell analyses post-AZA therapy from both patients and xenografts. The multi-omics comparative analyses will incisively determine the utility of MISTRG-W41 for MDS preclinical testing, by illustrating the extent to which AZA-affected programs in patients are similarly changed in the xenograft. This deep molecular, genotypic, and phenotypic understanding of HMA effects on subclonal and hierarchical cellular compositions of MDS will build the basis for comparison of novel-targeted-therapeutic agents as alternatives, concurrent, or post-HMA therapeutic approaches.",2021-01-01T12:01:00Z,2025-12-31T12:12:00Z,PAR-17-245,nofo_PAR-17-245,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,CINCINNATI,OH,UNITED STATES,omf

In particular, the “blood biopsy” which leverages circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) released by dying cancer cells, has potential utility for screening individuals at risk for cancer, determining those patients likely to relapse post treatment, identifying actionable mutations to plan treatment and characterizing tumor genome evolution. However, several challenges remain including the need to standardize collection and processing procedures, optimize sequencing/analysis platforms, and correlate data generated from ctDNA with patient outcomes. For example, factors such as time of day or vein used for blood collection (central vs. peripheral) may influence ctDNA yields and reproducibility of the assay. Moreover, while evaluation for common mutations can readily be performed using ctDNA (i.e., EGFR mutations in lung cancer), tumor types with low mutation burden and/or large structural variants (deletions/inversions) remain more difficult to characterize. Finally, prospective sampling of human patients to assess the predictive value of blood biopsy requires a relatively long timeline (years). While such studies would presumably be ideal in murine cancer models where disease progression is rapid, blood volumes are limited, repeated sampling can be difficult, and it is problematic to accurately recapitulate cycles of treatment response and resistance. Interestingly, pet dogs spontaneously develop cancers that closely mirror their human counterparts with respect to clinical course, molecular dysregulation and genomic alterations, and as such they represent a unique model for improving blood biopsy performance and application. Because pet dogs receive standard treatment (chem/radiation/immunotherapy) yet experience a compressed disease timeline, critical information can typically be obtained quite rapidly. Toward that end, we have generated preliminary data demonstrating that ctDNA is readily detectable in dogs with cancer, that genetic changes concordant with those in the tumor can be detected, and that treatment has a variable impact on ctDNA levels. The purpose of this proposal is to build upon these findings to credential dogs with cancer as a relevant tool for blood biopsy advancement and use this model to optimize and advance its application to human patients. Specifically, we will determine how various factors affect ctDNA yield, assess concordance of tumor and ctDNA sequence data, develop and implement a diagnostic mutation panel for patient screening, and conduct longitudinal studies to track both minimal residual disease and likelihood of relapse. To facilitate rapid clinical translation of findings, we selected canine cancers with genomic landscapes that have human equivalents: urothelial carcinoma (BRAF V595E), mast cell tumor (KIT internal tandem duplication), osteosarcoma (large structural variants), lymphoma (Myc amplification, TRAF3 mutation) and hemangiosarcoma (p53, PIK3CA mutation). Tools created through this work will have utility for ongoing as well as future canine translational cancer research, thereby supporting continued development of this model system.",2021-06-07T12:06:00Z,2026-05-31T12:05:00Z,PAR-17-245,nofo_PAR-17-245,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,WORCESTER,MA,UNITED STATES,omf
R01CA255372,Visualizing tumor heterogeneity in an immune intact and autochthonous mouse model of breast cancer,"ABSTRACT Genetically modified mouse models of breast cancer have been used for decades as premier basic science tools for mechanistic discovery. However, the successful implementation of mouse models as surrogates of therapeutic efficacy and translational research has been challenging. One major challenge for status quo approaches is their limited ability to model the genetic heterogeneity observed in breast cancers. Metastatic and treatment resistant HER2+ breast cancers are incurable largely due to this heterogeneity, the source of which may stem from the competition and evolution of multiple oncogenic isoforms of the driver gene HER2. The objective for this proposal is to recapitulate the genetic heterogeneity of HER2 oncogenes in a genetically tractable model more closely resembling the human condition – including an intact immune system and stromal network. Published preliminary data recently described a Cancer rainbow (Crainbow) modeling system for fluorescently barcoding and expressing multiple tumor driver genes in a single immune intact mouse. The fluorescent barcode is retrieved by multispectral imaging and single-cell “omics” techniques providing a simple solution for inducing intratumor heterogeneity and visualizing its evolution. Any tumor driver gene can be incorporated into Crainbow mice. Therefore, this proposal will test the central hypothesis that modeling the oncogenic heterogeneity of HER2 in a Cancer rainbow mouse recapitulates the phenotypic heterogeneity found in treatment resistant and metastatic HER2+ breast cancers. The central hypothesis will be tested by completing four specific aims seeking to: (Aim 1) Validate a HER2 Crainbow mouse model of tumor heterogeneity, (Aim 2) Demonstrate heterogeneity within the tumor epithelium, (Aim 3) Demonstrate heterogeneity of the tumor microenvironment and its contribution to tumor biology, and (Aim 4) Demonstrate heterogeneity and differential response to therapy. HER2 Crainbow mice will provide an autochthonous mouse model of the genetic heterogeneity found in HER2+ breast cancer, all while maintaining the endogenous contributions of the tumor microenvironment to invasion and metastasis. Completing this proposal is expected to validate the HER2 Crainbow mouse as a shareable resource strain for more predictive preclinical trials and a framework for illuminating the molecular and cellular ontogeny of invasive breast cancer.",2021-02-09T12:02:00Z,2026-01-31T12:01:00Z,PAR-17-245,nofo_PAR-17-245,DUKE UNIVERSITY,DURHAM,NC,UNITED STATES,omf
R01CA258113,Gamma delta T cell based melanoma therapies,"SUMMARY Our long-term objective is to develop highly translatable animal models for testing cancer immunotherapies. Animal models have been essential in cancer research. However, mouse tumor transplantation or tumor genetic models lack critical components for studying human anti-tumor responses such as high mutational load, tumor microenvironment (TME) and tumor heterogeneity or mice have major differences from humans in innate and adaptive immune responses. In response to PAR-20-131, we will use our novel humanized mouse models (HuMice) to test gamma-delta T (γδT) cell- based immunotherapies. Since Vγ9Vδ2+ T cells, a subtype of γδT cells that are most commonly used in adoptive immunotherapy, are unique to primates, traditional mouse models are not ideal to study human γδT cells. This proposal will maximize translational potential of mammalian models by studying Vγ9Vδ2+ T cells-based therapy in HuMice with HLA-matched human melanomas from cell lines or patient-derived xenografts (PDX). Our laboratories have established >500 melanoma PDX and >300 melanoma cell lines, which represent all clinical, genetic and biologic groups of the disease. In Aim 1, we will study adoptive transfer of enhanced γδT cells. We will test a new Vγ9Vδ2+ T cell expansion method in HuMice. We will then equip γδT cells with DR5-CAR that targets both myeloid derived suppressive cells and melanoma cells. We will study alterations in the TME after treatment. To avoid potential toxicity of targeting DR5, we will develop a novel combinatorial CAR that targets PD-L1 and DR5. In Aim 2, we will stimulate endogenous γδT cells for cancer therapy. We will use bromohydrin pyrophosphate (BrHPP) and resiquimod to expand endogenous human γδT cells to treat melanoma bearing HuMice. We will study whether BTN3A1 mAbs expand human γδT cells and govern antitumor functions of both γδ and CD8+ T cells in HuMice. We will then combine expansion of endogenous γδT cells with anti-PD-1 mAbs in melanoma-bearing HuMice. We expect that HuMice will allow us to test expansion of endogenous Vγ9Vδ2+ for cancer therapy for the first time in a model system and our new expansion methods are effective and may be optimized and tested in future clinical trials.",2021-12-13T12:12:00Z,2026-11-30T12:11:00Z,PAR-20-131,nofo_PAR-20-131,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,PHILADELPHIA,PA,UNITED STATES,omf
R01CA258226,Investigation of the role of epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity in renal cell carcinoma,"Sarcomatoid renal cell carcinoma (sRCC) represents an aggressive group of renal epithelial tumors characterized by histopathological features of epithelial–mesenchymal plasticity (EMT) and prominent metastatic behavior. These malignancies are extremely challenging in the clinic, as they fail to respond to the standard-of- care therapeutic regimens for RCC. Furthermore, in spite of the remarkable advances in cancer genomics, there are still no reliable tools or biomarkers to predict the clinical course of the disease, particularly in the context of modern therapeutic interventions. Objectives. The long-term goal of this project is to identify the genomic and molecular drivers of malignant progression in sRCC, focusing on the role of EMT in clonal evolution, in the acquisition of metastatic potential and as a mechanism of adaptation to therapy. This will lead to the identification of context-specific vulnerabilities dictated by the specific genomic and molecular landscapes that characterize this aggressive subset of kidney cancer. Rationale and Hypothesis. Preliminary studies showing the emergence of specific patterns of chromosomal alterations led us to the hypothesis that the acquisition of chromosomal instability (CIN) during tumor evolution favors the selection of clones endowed with high cellular plasticity and prominent metastatic potential. Specific Aims. In the first aim we will provide a detailed spatial and temporal annotation of epithelial and mesenchymal population dynamics during malignant progression and in response to pharmacological interventions. The second aim will define the genomic and transcriptomic landscape of the malignant subpopulation and the interplay between these cellular compartments and the components of the TME. In the third aim we will identify context-specific vulnerabilities, defining the genetic dependencies of epithelial and mesenchymal cells. Significance. The approach will provide fundamental information about clonal dynamics, tumor–host interactions at a single-cell resolution, and tumor evolution in RCC, substantially improving our understanding of the genetic and molecular bases of the disease. Translational relevance. A detailed understanding of the genetic and molecular events driving malignant cell plasticity and the evolution to sRCC will provide the framework to predict the behavior of this heterogeneous group of tumors. Furthermore, the functional genomic approach will uncover context-specific vulnerabilities and provide novel drug targets in a disease class in urgent need of effective treatments. Innovation. The project is innovative from a conceptual and technological standpoint. Targeting cancer-specific weaknesses emerging in the context of cell plasticity, increased tumor heterogeneity, and clonal diversification is a promising approach tailored to the genetic and functional hallmarks of the disease. The technological tools and approaches are unique and highly innovative. The introduction of a lineage-tracing technology and an embedded dynamic reporter will allow us to address several open questions in the field of EMT going beyond the specific tumor type. The work will therefore provide the scientific community with a valuable tool for basic and translational research.",2021-04-01T12:04:00Z,2026-03-31T12:03:00Z,PAR-20-131,nofo_PAR-20-131,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,HOUSTON,TX,UNITED STATES,omf
R01CA258248,Credentialing next-generation human glioma models for precision therapeutics,"ABSTRACT Despite notable success in EGFR-driven lung cancer, precision therapeutics have failed in EGFR-driven gliomas, the most common and deadly primary brain tumors. Reasons for failure of EGFR therapies in this clinical context include the lack of preclinical models that faithfully recapitulate the biology of EGFR-driven gliomas, including intra-tumor heterogeneity, drugs specifically designed to target invasive brain tumor cells located behind and intact blood-brain barrier (BBB), and adaptive drug resistance. Here we will develop and molecularly credential novel, EGFR-driven human glioma models for use in preclinical development of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)-based therapies. The foundation of the proposal comes from the Furnari Lab, who developed a novel platform (iGBM) for engineering glioma models using CRISPR genome editing and has established intra-tumor genetic heterogeneity as a symbiotic driver of tumorigenesis. The Miller Lab has extensive experience in small molecule experimental therapeutics using genetically engineered gliomas model and next-generation sequencing. He also used a novel chemical proteomics method, multiplex inhibitor beads coupled with mass spectrometry, to assess the glioma kinome en masse and showed that dynamic kinome reprogramming contributes to targeted drug resistance in glioma models. He is now at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, where local collaborators have extensive experience with biologically faithful human patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models. The O’Rourke Lab is a pioneer in development of sophisticated glioblastoma organoid (GBO) models that faithfully recapitulate the biology of molecularly and cellularly heterogeneous human tumors. In this Multi-PI project, we will combine our expertise to address the following Aims: (1) To develop novel genetically engineered human models driven by the most common EGFR extracellular domain mutations. We will then biologically and molecularly credential these models against genetically-matched PDX and GBO using genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, and kinome proteomics, and therapeutically challenge them using a panel of EGFR TKI, including one designed to specifically target invasive glioma cells behind the intact BBB. (2) To credential heterogeneous EGFR mutant iGBM models via biological, molecular, and EGFR TKI therapeutic profiling. We will thus develop human models with defined driver mutations that will be useful adjuncts to PDX/GBO for preclinical drug development. Models will be used to develop future rational combination therapies that combat drug resistance and enhance EGFR TKI efficacy. This work will therefore help realize the unmet need of precision therapeutics in neuro-oncology.",2022-01-12T12:01:00Z,2026-12-31T12:12:00Z,PAR-20-131,nofo_PAR-20-131,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,BIRMINGHAM,AL,UNITED STATES,omf
R01CA258265,Comparative modeling of sarcoma microenvironments for the discovery of biomarkers and tumor vulnerabilities,"ABSTRACT Soft-tissue sarcomas are heterogeneous tumors that originate from cells belonging to the mesenchymal lineages, and that affect almost 200,000 individuals worldwide each year. The most aggressive and metastatic sub-types in adults are those with complex karyotypes and multiple genetic aberrations. The overall survival of these sarcoma patients has not greatly improved in recent years, and alternative approaches to chemotherapy and radiotherapy such as immunotherapy have so far provided only marginal benefits. Novel therapeutic advances for UPS are hindered by the lack of knowledge about the functional consequences of the complex genomic alterations found in patients and limited characterizations of the tumor microenvironment (TME), which would reveal non-cell-autonomous mechanisms critical to sarcoma progression. Experimental tools and available animal models currently do not address these limitations. However, appropriate models could facilitate the efficient discovery of new targets and immune- based therapies for these tumors, which have relatively low incidence and for which the development of clinical trials is often challenging. Accordingly, we propose to generate sarcoma mouse models that encompass the actual somatic aberrations observed in patients. Moreover, we will use these models to facilitate studies of treatment response and TME composition. The employment of these new models, together with newer technologies such as single-cell RNA- sequencing (scRNA-seq), CyTOF and Imaging Mass Cytometry (IMC) will ultimately illuminate the key expression profile of the single tumor cells, mechanisms of metastasis, resistance to conventional treatments and TME components that may influence such mechanisms. Ultimately, these models will translate to the clinic more effective therapeutic combinations and regimens. Successful completion of this project will i) generate new mouse models of complex sarcoma that recapitulate the genetic defects found in human sarcoma and provide a comprehensive functional characterization of these models (Aim 1), ii) illuminate the expression profile of the tumor cells and discrete sub-groups of them, to understand how these profiles influence the TME composition (Aim 2), iii) test how these models respond to different radiotherapy administration schedules in the heterogeneous settings of distinct tumor genetics, expression profiles and environmental elements (Aim 3).",2021-03-26T12:03:00Z,2026-02-28T12:02:00Z,PAR-20-131,nofo_PAR-20-131,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,LOS ANGELES,CA,UNITED STATES,omf
R01CA261723,Epigenetically Engineered Mouse Model for Lung Cancer Therapy,"PROJECT SUMMARY (Abstract) The importance of aberrant DNA methylation in cancer is clear. The fundamental role of DNA methylation in cancer initiation and progression, however, remains elusive. The use of gene targeting in animal models definitively demonstrated that genetic mutations at specific genes cause disease. An analogous “epigenetic gene targeting” approach is urgently needed to advance the field of epigenetics. In human lung cancers, p16 promoter methylation associated epigenetic silencing is one of the earliest detected epimutations and is thought to function as a critical initiating event in tumorigenesis. The importance of this epimutation is further underscored by the associations with distinct gene mutation patterns, cancer prognosis, and response to therapy. However, the molecular pathways linking aberrant DNA methylation, epigenetic silencing, and tumorigenesis remain poorly characterized. In this regard, we published the first mouse model demonstrating that targeted p16 epimutation drives spontaneous tumor development. Importantly, our preliminary studies revealed that p16 epimutation operates synergistically with oncogenic K-RAS activation to drive lung cancer progression. Based on these findings, this proposal responds to PAR-20-131: Research Projects to Enhance Applicability of Mammalian Models for Translational Research. Our overall goals are to establish more faithful murine models of human lung cancer development and to utilize this epigenetically engineered mouse model for testing novel epigenetic therapeutic strategies. Specifically, we will: 1 − Employing epigenetic engineering in mice to model advanced human lung cancers. We propose to establish clinically relevant and immunocompetent mouse models based on defined genetic and epigenetic alterations to drive benign lung tumor growths towards the ultimate malignant phenotype. 2 − Testing combinatorial epigenetic therapy in mouse lung tumors carrying a driver p16 epimutation. We propose to test whether epigenetic targeting drugs and/or anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy can effectively suppress p16 epimutant lung tumor growth during critical transition points from non-malignant lesions to adenocarcinoma. These studies will elucidate the functional role of epimutations in lung tumorigenesis in vivo. Successful completion of the proposed studies will provide a mechanistic rationale to refine ongoing epigenetic therapy, with the potential to improve survival rates in lung cancer.",2021-07-01T12:07:00Z,2026-06-30T12:06:00Z,PAR-20-131,nofo_PAR-20-131,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,HOUSTON,TX,UNITED STATES,omf
R01CA261949,Engineering Large Chromosomal Deletions in Mice to Advance Precision Oncology,"Project Summary/Abstract Genomic deletions, including both focal and large arm-level chromosomal deletions, are frequent genetic events that promote cancer initiation and progression. Focal deletions have yielded significant insights into mechanisms underlying tumorigenesis by helping identify tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) residing in the deleted loci. In contrast, little is known about the biological and phenotypic impacts of large chromosomal deletions in cancer despite their occurrence 30 times more frequently than focal deletions. We and other researchers have shown that such deletions impact the activities of multiple neighboring TSGs and constitute a driving force in tumorigenesis. Additionally, concomitant loss of multiple genes triggered by broad-scale deletions can create phenotypes that differ fundamentally from those arising from the loss of a single TSG, and may offer unanticipated therapeutic opportunities. These losses should therefore be considered as distinct genetic events and their analysis should be focused on the integrated effects of chromosomal deletion rather than the impact of a single critical TSG. Genetically engineered mouse (GEM) models provide an ideal tool for investigating the consequences of genetic aberrations in tumor biology. However, due to the limited cloning capacity of targeting vectors (~300 Kb) and the rarity of on-target homologous recombination events in traditional gene-targeting technology, modelling large chromosomal deletions in mice has proven highly challenging, and the in vivo role of such lesions in tumorigenesis has therefore been significantly understudied. To fill this critical gap, we have developed an innovative approach to chromosomal engineering over large genetic distances through CRISPR/Cas9 technology in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. The resulting ES clones carrying the desired genome edits make possible the creation of conditional knockout mice that accurately mimic cancer-associated large deletions. Given the prevalence and significance of large chromosomal deletions in prostate cancer, here we propose to utilize our innovative approach to generate and fully characterize two novel GEM models that each harbor a common but distinct prostate cancer-associated large deletion, with a goal of validating and credentialing these models as genetically and biologically robust representations of human prostate cancer. In Aim 1, we will develop conditional mouse lines using CRISPR/Cas9 technology to target commonly deleted large chromosomal loci in human prostate cancer. In Aim 2, we will develop mouse models of prostate cancer harboring large chromosomal deletions to analyze their biological and phenotypic impacts on prostate cancer development. Taken together, these models and their characterization will meet multiple goals of this grant opportunity. Successful completion of these investigations will not only contribute greatly to the implementation of precision oncology research but also enhance the applicability of animal models to translational research.",2022-03-01T12:03:00Z,2027-02-28T12:02:00Z,PAR-20-131,nofo_PAR-20-131,DUKE UNIVERSITY,DURHAM,NC,UNITED STATES,omf
R01CA265884,Polymerase epsilon-based mouse and derived organoid models of intestinal cancer,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Intestinal cancer is the 3rd most common malignancy and cause of cancer-related deaths in both men and women. Unfortunately, recent advances in our understanding of the underlying intestinal biology and cancer- related pathways have not translated to significantly improved patient outcomes. While numerous animal models of intestinal cancer have been developed, mostly based on misregulation of the β-catenin pathway, some key features of human cancers (particularly tumor mutational burden) now known to be critical for tumor progression and therapy response, have not been adequately modelled or investigated in animal models of intestinal cancer. More recently, genome sequencing efforts led to the discovery of an intestinal cancer mutator phenotype where single amino acid substitutions within proofreading domains of the housekeeping DNA polymerases result in the highest mutation rates described in human cancers (ultramutation). Unlike human cancers, genetically-engineered animal models exhibit very low mutation rates, limiting their utility for studies of intratumoral heterogeneity and competition, immune responses, and immune checkpoint therapies, now known to be essential aspects of human tumor biology. We propose to overcome these limitations in intestinal cancer animal models by building upon 1) a strong track record in the generation of cancer animal models and novel genetic tools for their development 2) a well-characterized conditional PoleP286R allele that we previously used to develop a robust model of endometrial cancer and 3) expertise in genomics, inflammation, intestinal cancer, and mouse models of intestinal disease. These models will be useful not only to recapitulate POL-driven intestinal cancers, but also to humanize any intestinal cancer mouse model with respect to mutational burden. This proposal is submitted in response to PAR-20-131 to expand and improve the development of mammalian models for translational cancer research.",2022-09-15T12:09:00Z,2027-08-31T12:08:00Z,PAR-20-131,nofo_PAR-20-131,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,DALLAS,TX,UNITED STATES,omf
R01CA265933,Loss of NF1 drives hormone dependent mammary carcinogenesis in a rat model with intact immune system,"Loss of NF1 plays a major role as an oncogenic driver in many cancer types and can be found in up to 33% of all breast cancers (BC). Loss of NF1 is also a prognostic indicator for increased cancer risk at an earlier age, poorer outcomes, and therapeutic resistance. In addition, certain NF1 genotypes may increase cancer risks, while others do not. NF1 is largely perceived as a classic Ras-opathy syndrome due to inactivating mutations in neurofibromin affecting Ras-MAPK signaling. However, recently it has been shown that NF1 binds estrogen receptor (ER) and acts as a transcriptional corepressor. This helps explain some of these BC findings specifically in ER+ BC patients. In this model, specific changes to NF1 that abrogate ER signaling lead to Ras driven tumor resistance to endocrine therapy in up to 20% of ER+ patients as cells are able to grow in low levels of E2 (and tamoxifen). We have generated novel rat models deficient for Nf1 that have a very robust ER+ BC phenotype, therefore more closely recapitulating clinical tumors compared to other preclinical models. Our models include a pathogenic patient missense allele c.3827G>A, p.R1276Q (knockin or KI), associated in humans with spinal NF1 and malignancy, as well as a 14 base pair deletion c.3661_3674del, p.P1220fs*1223 (knockout or KO) model. Phenotypic differences between our models indicate that the variant matters, and restriction of tumor development to pregnancy in the KI females indicates hormone induction plays a major role in tumor development. Rats also develop lung lesions positive for metastatic BC markers. Our overall goal is to characterize the phenotype of these rat models in terms of histopathology, Ras signaling, hormone signaling, immune components, and targeted drug response and compare/contrast them with what is known regarding patients with somatic or germline inactivation of NF1 and breast cancer. Ultimately, this will provide better prognostic predictions for patients and better therapeutics for treatment. Aim 1 will evaluate tumor onset, growth, histology, and molecular characterization of Ras and estrogen signaling over time and compare/contrast with human BC tumor samples. Aim 2 will characterize the Nf1 deficient tumor microenvironment (TME), identify immuno-targets, and evaluate immuno-targeting with and without Ras-targeting therapeutics. Aim 3 will evaluate the role of hormones in tumor initiation, maintenance and targeting therapeutics. We will better define which hormone(s) drive both initiation and maintenance of mammary tumors deficient for Nf1 and utilize this information to target them both with and without co-targeting Ras to show synergy. As HR+ BC accounts for ~80% of patient cases, and that appropriate mammalian models with intact immune systems are lacking, we believe that our proposed studies are highly significant and will substantially advance the development of new therapies to this disease.",2022-07-01T12:07:00Z,2027-06-30T12:06:00Z,PAR-20-131,nofo_PAR-20-131,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,BIRMINGHAM,AL,UNITED STATES,omf
R01CA265978,Site-specific Integration of Large (10-100 kb) DNA Constructs into the Mouse Genome and Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells Using the Cas9-Bxb1 Integrase Toolbox,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The long-term goal of this project is to increase the ability of researchers to create faithful mouse and stem-cell models of human cancers and other diseases. Currently available genetic-engineering approaches, including the CRISPR-Cas9 system, which has revolutionized genome editing, lack the capacity for efficient integration of large DNA constructs (> 10 kilobases; kb) in mouse zygotes and mouse and human stem cells. This limitation significantly hinders the modeling of human diseases, including cancer. For example, tandem duplications (TDs), super-enhancers (SEs; large clusters of transcriptional enhancers), and large non-coding structural variants have been linked to human diseases, including cancers, but available technologies do not permit modeling such large variants in whole animals or cell lines. To fill this gap, we will develop a gene-editing toolbox that couples the precision of the CRISPR-Cas9 system with the fidelity and efficiency of the serine integrase Bxb1 to enable rapid, efficient insertion of large DNA constructs in mice, mouse embryonic stem cells, and human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). Bxb1 integrase uses DNA attachment sites (attP in the genome, attB in the donor DNA) as substrates for catalyzing efficient transgenesis. We show that our innovative Cas9-Bxb1 toolbox can precisely integrate DNA constructs up to ~43 kb in length in mice. Here, in three aims we will further develop and validate the toolbox to enable precise transgenesis of large DNA constructs (~100 kb) and to facilitate generation of DNA rearrangements. Aim 1: Optimize the Cas9-Bxb1 toolbox for insertion of large DNA (10 to 100 kb) constructs into mouse zygotes. We will use reporter constructs with differing lengths to determine the maximum length of DNA construct that can be inserted efficiently, and will validate a one-step protocol for rapid generation of transgenic mice without the need to first generate and characterize mice with attachment sites. Aim 2: Generate mouse and hiPSC models of human diseases, including cancer, using the Cas9-Bxb1 toolbox. Using our toolbox to insert large genomic variants, we will generate a mouse model of breast cancer (insertion of a 23.7-kb TD), hiPSC model of triple negative breast cancer (27.2-kb SE), and mouse model of Hirschsprung disease (~80-kb human risk allele). Aim 3: Enable use of the Cas9-Bxb1 toolbox for generation of DNA rearrangements. In cre-lox recombination systems, cre catalyzes recombination between two loxP sites flanking a target locus, enabling diverse DNA rearrangements. Studies suggest that cre-recombination efficacy is limited by the inter-loxP-site distance and the particular genomic site targeted. We will determine whether the Cas9- Bxb1 toolbox is more efficient than cre-lox for generation of DNA rearrangements, by determining Bxb1-mediated recombination efficacy at different inter-attP/attB distances. Successful completion of this project will provide the community with three new models for future studies, and a versatile tool for development of novel and improved mouse and hiPSC models of cancer and other diseases.",2022-07-01T12:07:00Z,2027-06-30T12:06:00Z,PAR-20-131,nofo_PAR-20-131,JACKSON LABORATORY,BAR HARBOR,ME,UNITED STATES,omf
R01CA269269,Escape from CAR T surveillance through lineage plasticity,"PROJECT SUMMARY Cancer cell genomic plasticity can enable resistance to cancer therapy for both solid tumors and hematologic malignancy. Escape from cytotoxic or molecularly targeted therapy through an inherent capacity to reprogram differentiation state or lineage has now been described following adoptive cell therapy or immune checkpoint blockade in adult epithelial tumors. Transfer of T cells genetically modified to express chimeric antigen receptors (CAR T cells) targeting the B cell surface antigen CD19 induces remission in 70-90% of patients with relapsed/refractory B cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (B-ALL) resulting in FDA-approval for this indication. However, a large fraction of those patients relapse within one year of treatment. This occurs with two main patterns, 1) early antigen-positive (CD19pos) relapse, attributed to poor CAR T expansion or lack of persistence, and 2) later antigen-negative relapse. Evasion of CD19-targeted immunotherapy can result from loss of all B lineage phenotypic markers with acquisition of stable, alternative phenotypes in MLL-rearranged (MLL-r), BCR-ABL driven, TCF3-ZNF384 and other subtypes of ALL. Remarkably, emergence of phenotypic switch can occur years after CD19-targeted immunotherapy. Understanding the mechanisms of immunotherapeutic resistance and identifying strategies to overcome these will be critical in improving remission depth and durability of response. Our proposal will address two major deficits in cancer models to identify factors contributing to relapse from immunotherapy: the lack of immune-intact model systems that recapitulate the lineage switching phenomenon observed using CD19-targeted immunotherapy and the lack of faithful mouse models recapitulating infant/childhood MLL-r B-ALL. This collaborative proposal brings together the extensive expertise of the Ernst group in the biology of MLL-r leukemia and hematopoiesis with the CAR T cell expertise of the Fry/Kohler groups to develop innovative new models systems to study evasion from CAR T cell therapy through lineage reprogramming. Our preliminary CAR T cell data employs immune-intact mouse models to illustrate that CD19neg relapse includes cells that exhibit gain of myeloid antigens and a myeloid transcriptional profile. On the pediatric B-ALL front, we develop a retroviral system to produce B-ALL that captures the inherent plasticity of MLL-r leukemias and switches to AML in vivo. Our proposal assesses the ability for both leukemia-intrinsic as well as extrinsic host- environmental components to influence escape from CAR T killing through lineage reprogramming. The findings of our studies, including the discovery of novel strategies to block lineage reprogramming have the potential to inform the development of similar approaches in other forms of cancer treated with cellular therapy and, potentially, immune checkpoint inhibitors. In addition, these studies may lead to a better understanding of lineage plasticity and the extent to which epigenetic heterogeneity contributes to relapse, which can directly inform the design of curative therapies.",2022-04-01T12:04:00Z,2027-03-31T12:03:00Z,PAR-20-131,nofo_PAR-20-131,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,Aurora,CO,UNITED STATES,omf
R01CA271498,Next Generation Rat Models of ER+ Breast Cancer,"Title: Next Generation Rat Models of ER+ Breast Cancer Abstract: Despite the prevalence of estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer (BCa), there are no mammalian models that are immunocompetent and metastasize spontaneously to clinically relevant organs such as bones. ER+ BCs comprise ~70% of BCa cases and are treated with surgical resection and adjuvant endocrine therapies. Although the 5-year survival rate is high, risk of metastatic recurrence persists for dec- ades, and 20-40% of ER+ BCa patients eventually succumb to metastatic disease, most often in bones. Our limited knowledge of ER+ BCa has been largely derived from oversimplified cell line models and in vitro experiments. Our available xenograft models exclude the critical immune component while genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) rarely stably maintain ER expression and rely on ER signaling – and none metastasize to bone, the most frequent site. As a result, very little is known about the initial tumori- genesis process and bone metastasis of ER+ BCa, which greatly impedes our effort to develop new prevention strategies or adjuvant therapeutics that can block/treat ER+ BCa bone metastasis. We have developed a series of rat ER+ BCa models by intraductal injection of viruses to introduce genetic alterations. Our preliminary data demonstrated that these rat ER+ mammary tumors: 1) developed in immunocompetent hosts, 2) showed endocrine therapy sensitivity or resistance, and 3) readily formed ER+ metastases including in bone – all of which are key properties that are lacking in existing BCa models. Based on these, we hypothesize that rat-based intraductal injection models (RIIMs) of breast cancer faithfully recapitulate human ER+ BCa in terms of tumor initiation, metastasis, and therapeutic responses. We will pursue the following three aims: (1) To characterize early progression of ER+ BCa in RIIM models. (2) To characterize the metastatic behaviors of ER+ BCa in RIIM models. (3) To credential ER+ RIIM models in recapitulating therapeutic responses and resistance mechanisms of human ER+ BCa.",2022-03-14T12:03:00Z,2027-02-28T12:02:00Z,PAR-20-131,nofo_PAR-20-131,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,HOUSTON,TX,UNITED STATES,omf
R01CA271601,Understanding the cellular and functional changes in the immune tumor microenvironment of glioblastoma during progression and treatments.,"Project Summary Glioblastoma (GBM) is an incurable primary malignant brain cancer characterized by a high degree of interpatient and intratumoral genomic and cellular heterogeneity, a brief median survival (~15 months), and absence of an effective treatment. Even the successes of checkpoint blockade immunotherapies observed in many cancers have not translated to GBM. The GBM tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) is highly immunosuppressive and is dominated by resident and infiltrating myeloid cells (30-40% of the tumor mass) compared to rare T cells (<5%). Although recent single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNAseq) studies have provided broad characterization of the cellular makeup and evolution of GBM tumor cells, dissecting the diversity, function and regional localization of the immune composition of GBM remains incomplete. There is also a widespread lack of knowledge on the evolution of intratumoral immune cells during GBM progression, and throughout treatment with standard of care (SOC) therapies (ionizing radiation/ temozolomide/dexamethasone IR/TMZ/DEX). Major challenges to achieving scientific and clinical impact in GBM remain, including an in-depth understanding of the interactions between cancer cells and the immune microenvironment in the context of SOC and immunotherapy treatments. Such knowledge is difficult to obtain using freshly excised patient samples. The main hypothesis of the proposal is that critical and clinically relevant changes in GBM neoplastic and immune cells brought about by treatment modalities can be revealed using genetically accurate mouse models to parse and redirect analyses of human patient datasets. A mechanistic understanding of the effects of therapies on immune and tumorigenic cell population dynamics in pre-clinical mouse models in combination with analysis of human patient datasets will yield transformative advancements in the field. We will leverage archival patient samples, mouse models of GBM and GLASS consortium datasets to uncover SOC-related cellular and molecular evolutionary changes using scRNA seq and spatial transcriptomics. We will also unveil factors determining sensitivity and resistance to checkpoint blockade therapy. By integrating detailed mouse and human data, we will identify areas of unrecognized therapeutic vulnerabilities and pave the way for the development of new treatment approaches.",2023-04-17T12:04:00Z,2028-03-31T12:03:00Z,PAR-20-131,nofo_PAR-20-131,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,BOSTON,MA,UNITED STATES,omf
R01CA272426,preclinical optimization of BCMA directed T cell therapy,"PROJECT SUMMARY The pillars of multiple myeloma (MM) therapy are DNA alkylators (cyclophosphamide, melphalan), proteasome inhibitors (bortezomib, carfilzomib, ixazomib), glucocorticoids (dexamethasone, prednisone) and IMiDs (thalidomide, lenalidomide, pomalidomide). Despite achieving an initial response, patients inevitably relapse and MM remains incurable. More recently, remarkable responses have been obtained with immunotherapy: antibodies against CD38 (daratumumab), bi-specific antibodies or BiTEs to BCMA, CAR-T cells against BCMA. However, similarly to what observed with conventional therapy, none of these immune-oncology agents are curative. We believe that in order to improve patient outcome we need to better define the changes induced by the tumor on the surrounding immune cells and the effects that conventional and immunotherapy exert on the tumor and its microenvironment. Unfortunately, most preclinical studies are conducted on xenograft models lacking an immune system, or transiently reconstituted with human immune subsets and fail to capture the complex interaction between tumor and immune cells. Using the clinically predictive, fully immunocompetent Vk*MYChCRBN mouse model of MM we have generated, we discovered that sensitivity to anti-BCMA bispecific antibody is affected by high tumor burden, which drives excessive antigenic stimulation and T cell exhaustion. Combination therapies aimed to boost T cell function increase the short-term activity of the bispecific antibody, but mice eventually relapse with modest improve in overall survival. Surprisingly, the addition of cyclophosphamide proved very effective, by inducing a tempered but durative T cell activation which was curative in a fraction of mice. Based on our results in VkMYChCRBN MM we have designed a phase 1, randomized phase 2 clinical trial of a BCMA/CD3 bispecific antibody teclistamab with the addition either iberdomide or cyclophosphamide. In this proposal we aim to use the results of treating MM patients with either single agent teclistamab, or combinations with iberdomide or cyclophosphamide to credential the Vk*MYChCRBN MM model for T-cell directed immunotherapy. Finally, we will investigate factors that regulate the development of immunologic protection and cure after bispecific antibody therapy. Overall, these data will further credential the Vk*MYChCRBN mouse model of MM and inform the clinical development of bispecific antibodies in MM.",2023-09-20T12:09:00Z,2028-08-31T12:08:00Z,PAR-20-131,nofo_PAR-20-131,MAYO CLINIC ARIZONA,SCOTTSDALE,AZ,UNITED STATES,omf
R01CA272466,"""Novel Mouse Models for Quantitative Understanding of Baseline and Therapy-Driven Evolution of Prostate Cancer Metastasis""","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT On average, a man dies from PCa every 16 minutes, mainly due to development of secondary malignant growths outside of the primary cancer site, known as metastases. The cornerstone of PCa treatment is androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). ADT temporarily halts PCa, but leads to resistance in nearly all cases, resulting in castration-resistant PC (CRPC). CRPC then undergoes further evolution of metastatic subclones and results in incurable disease. Research techniques revealing resistance mechanisms and clonal evolution of metastatic PCa are lacking due to the limited capacity of current animal models to mimic PCa evolution in its native microenvironment as well as inefﬁcient methods for tracing subclonal evolution. Therefore, we developed EvoCaP (!Evolution in Cancer of the Prostate”), a mouse model of endogenous metastasis that recapitulates human PCa genetically, by using PTEN/TP53 co-deletions enriched in metastatic patients, and phenotypically, by focal initiation of primary disease progressing to bones, lungs, lymph nodes and liver metastases. Our model uses a lentiviral platform - LV.CreBC10 carrying: (1) Cre (Pten/Trp53 co- deletions; activation of Cas9, ﬂuorescence and luminescence markers); (2) Barcode with ten sites for marking by Cas9 (BC10); (3) RNA guide speciﬁcally marking BC10; and (4) guide or short hairpin RNA for testing metastatic drivers. Luminescence (FLuc) permits continuous tracking of disease progression and ﬂuorescence (eGFP) allows for speciﬁc sorting of cancer cells. BC10 represents a synthetic array of on-target sites, in order of decreasing activity, for the RNA guide that attracts Cas9 to generate subsequently speciﬁc edits. To streamline barcode analysis, we have established an R package - EvoTraceR. This comprehensive system enables: (1) the proﬁling of cancer cells based on shared mutational patterns in primary and metastasis; and (2) the building of phylogenetic trees to track evolution toward metastases in a robust and ﬂexible way. Our central hypothesis is that differences in distinct molecular and phenotypical clonal architectures will be precisely detected between primary and metastatic sites depending on therapy status, enabling the inhibition of metastasis and/or resistance promoting genes and pathways. Our analyses will establish and mechanistically validate drivers of metastatic clonal expansion caused by Pten/Tp53-loss (basal) and also investigate how evolutionary pressure from therapy (ADT), applied at different stages of PCa, leads to the emergence of resistant clones. We will then use Cas9/guide (g)RNA and inducible short hairpins to target genes altered in those expanding clones to identify drivers of both treatment-naive and treatment-induced PCa metastasis. EvoCaP can feasibly track molecular evolution and validate targets for drug development, which may lead to identiﬁcation of novel metastatic driver genes and pathways. Thus, therapies could be applied in: (1) primary diseases for early detection and interruption of metastases development; and (2) already existing metastases. Importantly, technologies developed in this project can also be applied to other types of metastatic cancers.",2023-04-01T12:04:00Z,2028-03-31T12:03:00Z,PAR-20-131,nofo_PAR-20-131,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,NEW YORK,NY,UNITED STATES,omf
R01CA275945,In vivo prime editing for precision cancer mouse models,"Project Summary/Abstract Cancer genomic studies have identified a large number of mutations, including point mutations, insertions/deletions (indels), and structural variants in coding and regulatory regions. For many uncharacterized mutations, how they contribute to tumor growth and resistance to therapy remains murky. In vivo functional validation is a pre-requisite for identifying suitable interventions and biomarkers. Rapid and flexible genome editing platforms are therefore needed to build and validate precision mouse models with translational value. Recent advances in CRISPR-based genome editing allow us to directly model cancer mutations in adult mouse tissues, bypassing the need for germline mouse models. Current CRISPR-based approaches however are either inefficient (e.g., homology directed repair) or cannot be used to model all types of mutations (e.g., base editing). A more flexible genome editing platform is needed to speed up the generation of somatic cancer mouse models. We have begun to optimize prime editing as a way to precisely model a wide variety of cancer mutations in mice. Prime editor (PE)—Cas9 nickase fused to reverse transcriptase—utilizes an extended guide RNA (called a pegRNA) that doubles as a template for reverse transcriptase to copy information into the genomic target. We have recently developed an optimized PE that can install cancer mutations in mouse liver. We also engineered a dual-PE approach to precisely introduce large deletions (up to ~10 kb) with short insertions. This work provides a foundation upon which to further optimize the delivery of PE to mice and to expand its application to cancer mouse models. The goal of this project is to develop and optimize new PE tools to speed up the generation of both constitutive and inducible somatic mouse models of liver and lung cancer. Aim 1 will define rules for optimal pegRNA design while validating 100 cancer-associated mutations, establish platforms for somatic cancer modeling in vivo, define pre-clinical features of PE models, and develop delivery vectors for multiplexed prime editing in mouse lung. Aim 2 will develop prime editing tools for inducible cancer models. Dual-PE approaches will be used to make inducible alleles and floxed alleles in mouse liver. We will also generate efficient PE models to recapitulate large genomic deletions in human cancer. This project will result in new mouse models that validate driver mutations in liver and lung cancer and will provide a flexible platform to enhance the translational utility of mouse models of cancer.",2023-08-17T12:08:00Z,2028-07-31T12:07:00Z,PAR-20-131,nofo_PAR-20-131,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,WORCESTER,MA,UNITED STATES,omf
R01CA278089,Optimizing Syngeneic Mouse Models to Target Mutant p53,"Optimizing Syngeneic Mouse Models to Target Mutant p53 Project Abstract The tumor suppressor gene p53 is the guardian of the human genome. p53 is a transcription factor that transactivates a battery of target genes in cells upon diverse stressors, including environmental carcinogens and oncogene activation. Inherited mutations in the p53 coding sequence occur in ~80% of all families with Li- Fraumeni syndrome (LFS), a rare autosomal dominant hereditary disorder characterized by a high-penetrance predisposition to multiple types of cancers. Somatic mutation of the p53 coding sequence occurs in about half of all cancers. Most alterations in the p53 coding sequence, either germline in LFS patients or somatic in cancer tissues, are missense mutations in the DNA-binding domain that result in an oncogenic protein. Due to its high mutation frequency and critical role in cancer initiation and progression, mutant p53 is a high- priority target for the development of anticancer therapies. Several small molecules have been developed to convert mutant p53 to a form that exhibits some wild-type properties (i.e., p53 reactivation). Such compounds are in clinical trials, yet none of them have been approved by the FDA. There are several major types of mouse models for cancer research, each with weaknesses and strengths: syngeneic, human cell line- derived xenograft, patient-derived xenograft, genetically engineered, and carcinogen-induced. Most therapeutic programs against mutant p53 use human cell line-derived xenograft, which is immunodeficient. Syngeneic mouse models, also known as allograft tumor systems, consist of tumor tissues derived from the same genetic background as a given mouse strain. Syngeneic mouse models with a functional immune system are superior to human cell line-derived xenografts for immunotherapeutic development. Syngeneic mouse models are instrumental in developing novel antitumor immunotherapies, yet there are no corresponding models to most p53 hotspot mutations found in human cancers. In this project, we will study the potential vulnerability of top somatic human p53 hotspot mutants using optimized syngeneic mouse models. Specifically, we will knock the top ten human p53 hotspot mutations into representative syngeneic mouse tumor cell lines. We will test monoclonal antibodies and vaccines targeting the p53 mutants in mice with a functional immune system. This work will define new uses of syngeneic mouse cell lines and test approaches to validate and credential the optimized p53 experimental model systems. Our findings will have broad and far-reaching translational significance by addressing the unmet clinical need for precision medicine against mutant p53.",2023-04-17T12:04:00Z,2028-03-31T12:03:00Z,PAR-20-131,nofo_PAR-20-131,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,HOUSTON,TX,UNITED STATES,omf
R01CA281784,A new mouse model for studying the pathogenesis and immunobiology of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and improving its immunotherapy,"ABSTRACT Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is an aggressive primary liver cancer (PLC) that is particularly hard to treat, having an overall 5-year survival rate of 8%. Like the major PLC, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), ICC incidence is on the rise due to the ongoing increase in cholestatic liver diseases, non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases, type 2 diabetes and alcohol and tobacco abuse. Unlike HCC, ICC is often detected at an advanced stage when survival prospects are poor, a complication of its imprecise differentiation from early HCC by current radiological techniques. Early differential diagnosis of two PLCs is critical due to their distinct management and the absence of targetable oncogenic drivers shared by ICC and HCC. This problem could be solved by identification of a PLC- type agnostic therapeutic approach, such as immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI), that is applicable to both ICC and HCC. However, while ICI based therapies were approved for HCC and their efficacy has been improved by combination with VEGF inhibitors, they have performed poorly in ICC. This failure can be attributed, in part, to poor mechanistic understanding of the ICC-specific immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) and lack of suitable mouse models that allow the evaluation of ICI in combination with therapeutics capable of dismantling immunosuppression. We have solved this problem by developing a new ICC model that unlike previous mouse models does not depend on forced overexpression of potent oncogenic drivers that rapidly induce ICC in the absence of selective pressure for acquisition of additional mutations. Our MUP-uPA/NRF2Act model depends on combination of ER stress with activation of transcription factor NRF2 in bipotential hepatobiliary progenitors and mature hepatocytes and shows robust, highly penetrant, human-like stepwise progression towards ICC that is accompanied by the buildup of an immunosuppressive TME exhibiting CD8+ T cell exclusion. We plan to establish the MUP-uPA/NRF2Act mouse as the leading model for studying the evolution of ICC and its immunosuppressive TME and for finding treatments that will dismantle immunosuppression and boost the response to existing PD-(L)1 inhibitors. To accomplish this goal, we will fully characterize the MUP- uPA/NRF2Act mouse, defining the transcriptomic, epigenetic, and genetic alterations at each stage of ICC progression, including ductular reactions, biliary intraepithelial neoplasia and established desmoplastic cancer. We will also define the T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes at each stage of malignant progression and mine the transcriptomic data for cancer cell produced factors that mediate desmoplasia, immunosuppression and CD8+ T cell exclusion. These studies will be complemented by immunophenotyping and immunodepletion experiments whose goal is the identification of targetable molecular switches responsible for establishment of the ICC-specific immunosuppressive TME. We will use this information to identify clinically approved treatments that can overcome immunosuppression and vastly improve the efficacy of ICI therapy based on PD-(L)1 inhibitors.",2023-09-19T12:09:00Z,2028-08-31T12:08:00Z,PAR-20-131,nofo_PAR-20-131,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",LA JOLLA,CA,UNITED STATES,omf
R01CA285272,Cross-species development and credentialing of pediatric AML models,"PROJECT SUMMARY: The objective of this multi-principal investigator application is to leverage the complimentary expertise of the investigators to develop and credential multiple new mouse models of high-risk, pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML). These will include both human and mouse AML with genotypes and cells of origin that are informed by real-world patient data and represent understudied high-risk molecular subtypes of the disease. This proposal will address a pressing clinical and scientific need. Children with AML continue to have an overall poor survival relative to other pediatric cancer patients. Advances in targeted therapies have been slow to develop, and up- front treatment protocols have remained remarkably stagnant for the past 4 decades. Efforts to derive new therapies have lagged, in part due to the marked genetic heterogeneity of pediatric AML. Indeed, we have established that there are over 20 unique molecular subtypes of pediatric AML that reflect unique driver mutations and expression signatures. Pediatric AML also harbor secondary mutations that further exacerbate genetic heterogeneity. Thus, therapies that might benefit patients with one genetic subtype of pediatric AML could have limited value in a different patient population. Unfortunately, current models of pediatric AML do not reflect the marked genomic diversity observed in patients. Current approaches commonly focus on a limited subset of molecular subtypes, typically avoiding rare high-risk subtypes, and they either do not co-model secondary mutations or they implement mutational combinations that are not reflected in patients. Thus, there remains a clear unmet need to advance pediatric AML modeling as a means to expand genetically informed therapeutic options. We will address this need through the completion of three Aims that exploit the unique skills of each investigator’s independent research programs and the exceptional institutional infrastructures at both St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital and Washington University School of Medicine. Aim 1: Develop novel syngeneic mouse models of high-risk pediatric AML; Aim 2: Develop human models of rare pediatric AMLs with patient- informed cooperating mutations; Aim 3. Credential established and newly developed AML models against one another and primary human specimens. To create AML models, we will deploy several innovative genetic strategies, including a novel approach to generate genetically complex murine AML from induced pluripotent stem cells and direct editing of human cord blood progenitors. Credentialing will involve a direct comparison of primary patient material with genetically matched murine and human models based on transcriptomic, epigenomic and proteomic strategies. The high-risk pediatric AML models developed through this comprehensive, cross-species proposal will provide the scientific community with an unparalleled collection of extensively characterized specimens for future investigations into disease mechanisms and therapeutic vulnerabilities.",2023-12-15T12:12:00Z,2028-11-30T12:11:00Z,PAR-20-131,nofo_PAR-20-131,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,SAINT LOUIS,MO,UNITED STATES,omf
R01CA285308,Genetically engineered mouse model to improve therapy of NUT carcinoma,"NUT carcinoma (NC) is an aggressive squamous carcinoma driven by the BRD4-NUT fusion oncoprotein. NC affects all ages and is highly lethal (>90%), a median survival of 6.5 months. There are no effective treatment options for NC; thus, this disease represents an extreme unmet need. The overarching goal of this proposal is to improve survival of these patients through mechanism-driven identification and testing of therapeutic targets. In response to the need for an immunocompetent animal model in which both NC cell-autonomous and -non- autonomous pathogenic mechanisms can be investigated rigorously, we have developed the first genetically engineered mouse (GEM) model of NC. As a squamous carcinoma, NC serves as a paradigm for fusion oncoprotein-driven solid tumors. The NC GEM will expand that paradigm to understanding how tumor intrinsic and extrinsic interactions sustain NC growth. Mechanistically, BRD4 is a BET family protein whose dual bromodomains bind acetyl-histones that when fused to NUT, recruits the histone acetyltransferase, p300, forming enormous super-enhancers called megadomains. BRD4-NUT megadomains maintain expression of pro-growth, anti-differentiation transcription factors including MYC, SOX2, and TP63. Our demonstration that treatment with BET bromodomain inhibitors (BETi), small molecules that competitively inhibit binding of BET bromodomains to chromatin, can inhibit growth of NC in humans, led to a new field investigating the role of BRD4 in cancer. However, it has become clear that monotherapy with BETi does not fully address NC biology. We have recently found that repression of tumor suppressor gene expression, such as that of CDKN2A/B, by the histone methyltransferse, EZH2, highly complements oncogenic activation by BRD4-NUT in maintaining NC growth. Targeting of this pathway with tazemetostat (taz) is highly synergistic with BETi and will be explored in the proposed GEM model. It is now recognized that NC harbors an immune-evasive tumor microenvironment (TME) and can respond to immune modulation therapy. Epigenetic modulators such as taz and BETi are known to promote an anti-tumor immune TME. Thus, pre-clinical animal models with intact immune systems such as our NC GEM are needed to fully evaluate effects of epigenetic modifiers, and the role of immune therapy in this disease. Our GEM has a tamoxifen-inducible, conditional knock-in fusion of murine Brd4 with human NUTM1, encoding a BRD4-NUT fusion oncoprotein. Invasive tumors formed in our NC GEM (`mNC') have provided the most definitive evidence that BRD4-NUT is the sole driver of this cancer. mNC closely mimics human NC, demonstrating rapid growth, metastatic spread, and an indistinguishable histopathology and immunophenotype. Moreover, the immune cell composition of the mNC TME also resembles that of human NC. We will make use of our novel GEM to address the following aims: 1. establish the applicability of the NC GEM (mNC) to human NC (hNC) biology.; 2. devise improved primary therapy for NUT carcinoma.; 3. explore approaches to prevent relapse of NC.",2023-09-19T12:09:00Z,2028-08-31T12:08:00Z,PAR-20-131,nofo_PAR-20-131,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,BOSTON,MA,UNITED STATES,omf
R21CA209848,Algorithms for Literature-Guided Multi-Platform Identification of Cancer Subtypes,"Project Abstract The development of accurate and robust statistical methods for cancer subtype identification using high throughput genomic data is of critical importance to public health, because these methods will inform molecularly-based tumor classification and shared pathogeneses, which offers opportunities for overlapping treatments across various cancer subtypes. In spite of tremendous efforts to develop statistical methods for the analysis of high throughput genomic data profiled in multiple platforms for cancer subtype identification, it still remains a challenging task to implement robust and interpretable identification of cancer subtypes and driver molecular features using these massive, complex, and heterogeneous datasets. The impact derived from improved understanding of tumor classification and driver molecular features can be dramatic, as this knowledge can be used to develop more effective prevention and intervention strategies to reduce the burdens of patients suffered from cancers. The goal of this proposal is to develop a statistical method and software to improve identification of cancer subtypes and driver molecular features by integrating genomic data profiled in multiple platforms with biomedical literature and existing pathway databases. Utilization of pathway information in cancer subtype identification will improve robustness in identification of cancer subtypes and driver molecular features. On the other hand, biomedical literature will supplement the incompleteness of pathway annotations in existing databases. It will also provide a common knowledgebase to integrate information from diverse pathway databases because biomedical literature provides comprehensive information about the relationship among genes. We will test these hypotheses in three specific aims. In Specific Aim 1, we will develop a novel statistical method and software to improve the pathway knowledge by integrating PubMed literature with existing pathway databases. In Specific Aim 2, we will develop a novel statistical method and software to improve robustness and interpretability in identification of cancer subtypes and driver molecular features using pathway knowledge. In addition, this method will allow investigation of driver molecular features at multiple levels, including pathway clusters, pathways, and genes. In Specific Aim 3, we will apply the statistical methods developed in Specific Aims 1 and 2 to the novel genomic data for mucinous ovarian cancer to promote understanding of the subtypes and the driver molecular features of this under-studied disease.",2016-08-01T12:08:00Z,2019-07-31T12:07:00Z,PAR-15-334,nofo_PAR-15-334,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,CHARLESTON,SC,UNITED STATES,itcr
R21CA209874,Developing Enabling PET-CT Image Analysis Tools for Predicting Response in Radiation Cancer Therapy,"ABSTRACT The integrated Positron Emission Tomography and Computed Tomography (PET-CT) has become an indispensable tool in modern cancer therapy. Accurate target delineation is an inevitable first step towards fully making use of the potentials of PET-CT. However, in current clinical practice, this important task is typically performed visually on a slice-by-slice basis with very limited support of automated segmentation tools. The state-of-the-art PET-CT segmentation techniques rely on either a single modality or the fused PET-CT data, which may not fully take advantage of both modalities, thus compromising the segmentation accuracy. In addition, the state-of-the-art therapeutic response prediction methods highly rely on the handcrafted image features and parameters, which poses a limiting factor for their wide use in clinic. This research proposes to develop fast and objective PET-CT analysis methods to facilitate the utilization of the dual modality imaging for both large-scale clinical trial research and daily clinical care. The novel feature of the proposed methods is the first time to introduce co-segmentation for PET-CT tumor delineation, which recognizes the contour difference of tumors in PET from those in CT. New PET-CT specific priors will be explored and incorporated into the segmentation framework, further improving the accuracy of segmentation. The proposed response prediction method is built on the accurate tumor definition from our PET-CT co- segmentation approach, with an innovative design of a convolutional neural network for automatically learning hierarchical features directly from the PET-CT scans, leading to highly accurate prediction of response. The developed methods will be tested in comparison with state-of-the-art methods utilized today. The performance of the methods will be statistically assessed in data samples of sufficient sizes.",2016-09-06T12:09:00Z,2019-07-31T12:07:00Z,PAR-15-334,nofo_PAR-15-334,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,IOWA CITY,IA,UNITED STATES,itcr
R21CA209875,A network-based approach for personalized treatment of Multiple Myeloma,"Project Summary Multiple Myeloma (MM) is an incurable malignancy of plasma cells affecting more than 20,000 patients each year, with a median survival of approximately 6 years. Despite recent advancements in therapy, the disease remains fatal in the majority of patients. Genetic aberrations including translocations, mutations in crucial cellular pathways, and copy number alterations, have been identified as molecular hallmarks of MM. However, the causal drivers of MM pathogenesis are still unclear, and treatment is given empirically based on recurrence risk rather than genetic events. High-throughput DNA sequencing of MM patients has revealed wide and remarkable heterogeneity of the mutational spectrum across the cohort of patients and complex sub-clonal structure. Clonal heterogeneity, evolution and competition suggest that the employment of a personalized therapeutic approach is likely to improve the outcomes for myeloma. In the past recent years, integrative network-based methods have proven to be extremely effective in modeling complex biological systems and uncovering novel patterns of genomic perturbation associated to disease initiation and progression. However, to date, there have been no network-based models in hematological malignancies developed using large-scale next generation sequencing data. In on going research, we have developed an integrative network biology approach to infer an improved molecular model of newly diagnosed MM. Our preliminary results show that our methodology is able to successfully recover previous knowledge and identify novel biological features of MM at both general and patient-specific level. This makes our approach naturally suitable for personalized medicine applications. Moreover, case studies of patients treated at Mount Sinai based on deep sequencing analysis show that a data-driven personalized therapy approach could be an effective way of treating patients resistant to the standard of care. To take our methodology to the next level, we propose to develop a complete “bench- to-bedside” intelligent learning precision medicine platform for personalized cancer therapy, specifically designed for MM based on large datasets and a novel comprehensive integrative network approach. We will generate network models of myeloma patients in order to infer key driver genetic alterations, derive prognostic signatures and stage-specific features, perform disease subtype classification and inform therapy prioritization. The tool will match individual patients profiles with network-inferred disease classes, in order to select the most appropriate treatments, and will perform combination therapy prediction using tumor clonality assessment. Physician's opinion and therapy outcome will be used as feedback to refine the predictions through reinforcement learning techniques. It is important to note that, although the system will be built based on MM models, it will be practically applicable to other types of cancer, providing a general framework for personalized network-based therapy in oncology.",2017-07-06T12:07:00Z,2019-06-30T12:06:00Z,PAR-15-334,nofo_PAR-15-334,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,NEW YORK,NY,UNITED STATES,itcr

R21CA209941,Structure-based selection of tumor-antigens for T-cell based immunotherapy,"Project Summary Developing effective cancer treatments remains one of the most important challenges for healthcare, and T-cell based immunotherapy has provided some very positive recent advances in cancer treatment. Cytotoxic T lym- phocytes (CTLs) can circulate through the body and are capable of identifying and eliminating tumorigenic cells. The recognition of tumor depends on the specific interaction between the T-cell receptor of CTLs and Human Leucocyte Antigen (HLA) class I molecules at the tumor cell surface, which binds and displays peptides derived from intracellular proteins. Peptide-HLA complexes are presented by all nucleated cells, constituting an efficient surveillance mechanism by which the immune system can recognize aberrant changes within cells of the body. Al- though CTL surveillance likely evolved to eliminate virally-infected cells, this system also provides very promising opportunities for cancer treatment and specifically the development of immune-based therapies. However, such therapies must be highly personalized since most of these tumor-associated peptides are patient-specific. This is due mainly to the high level of HLA diversity within the human population, combined with the fact that each person’s tumor acquires unique genetic aberrations. A further challenge is the identification of tumor-specific pep- tides that are not also expressed by normal cells, which will likely ensure less off-target effects during therapy. Our long-term goal is to perform structure-guided selection of tumor-derived peptides with potential for immunother- apy, which will also allow structural analysis of different peptide-HLA complexes recognized by a given T-cell; this knowledge will help to prevent dangerous off-target toxicities. The objective of this project is to develop computa- tional tools to enable docking-based modeling of peptide-HLA complexes, starting with HLA variants (allotypes) that are highly prevalent within human population and moving toward others that are less prevalent (for person- alized treatment). Our Preliminary Data supports the need for a structural framework to improve the selection of targets for immunotherapy, since current methods have important limitations, particularly with regard to less prevalent HLAs. The central hypothesis is that structure-based analysis can be used to improve peptide target selection for individual HLA allotypes and thus facilitate the development of personalized immunotherapies for all cancer patients. Two specific aims were designed to test this hypothesis. In Specific Aim 1, a docking method will be specifically tailored to make binding predictions of tumor-derived peptides to two highly frequent and well- studied HLAs, HLA-A*2402 and HLA*A1101, collectively expressed by >55% of the world population. In Specific Aim 2, the HLA-A3 superfamily, collectively expressed by >40% of the human population, will be used as a model for extending the methods towards less well-studied HLAs. Innovative computational methods will be applied in this project and cutting-edge experimental resources will be used to train and validate computational methods. The underlying rationale is that developing a computational framework for these prevalent HLA allotypes will facilitate the development of personalized, antigen-specific immunotherapies, which would benefit a much larger number of cancer patients.",2016-09-01T12:09:00Z,2019-08-31T12:08:00Z,PAR-15-334,nofo_PAR-15-334,RICE UNIVERSITY,HOUSTON,TX,UNITED STATES,itcr
R21CA214845,Statistical Evaluation and Selection of Normalization Methods for microRNA Sequencing Data in Cancer Biomarker Studies,"ABSTRACT Various normalization methods, including both simple re-scaling-based methods and regression-based methods, have been developed for RNA sequencing data to remove unwanted variations in sequencing depth due to experimental handling. Most of these methods presuppose that variations in the assumed scaling factor or in the projection of the assumed regression function are solely due to data artifacts and should be removed. This assumption, however, may not hold for studies of low-complexity RNA molecules such as microRNAs (a prevalent class of small RNAs that are closely related to carcinogenesis) that tend to be expressed in a tissue- specific manner with only a small number of molecules expressed dominantly. The properties of depth normalization methods have not been assessed for tumor microRNA data. In this proposal, we will conduct such an assessment using a unique pair of microRNA datasets for the same set of tumor samples, where one dataset was collected using uniform handling and balanced sequencing library assignment while the second dataset was collected using neither. The former dataset can be assessed for disease-relevant microRNAs, serving as a benchmark; the latter can be used to test normalization methods in comparison with the benchmark. An R package will be built for the proposed assessment and disseminated to the research community to reproduce our study and conduct objective evaluation of new methods. In addition to method assessment, we will develop a novel statistical approach for guiding the choice of a normalization method for the data under study using the paired datasets and test this approach in microRNA data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). An R package will be developed to implement the proposed approach and disseminated to the research community to use.",2018-09-10T12:09:00Z,2021-08-31T12:08:00Z,PAR-15-334,nofo_PAR-15-334,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,NEW YORK,NY,UNITED STATES,itcr
R21CA220299,Proteomic-based integrated subject-specific networks in cancer,"Project Summary/Abstract The overall objective of this proposal is to develop general analytic frameworks to characterize patient-specific pathway signatures by sequential estimations of cancer-specific (global) and patient-specific (local) networks. We develop innovative and flexible knowledge-guided quantitative frameworks that integrate multiple sources of information: qualitative and unstructured knowledge databases, data-driven de novo causal structures as well as upstream multi- platform molecular profiling data at the genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic and proteomic levels. Our methods are motivated by and applied to novel, unpublished, reverse-phase protein array-based proteomic profiles generated on patient tumor samples across 32 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) as well as cell line samples from the MD Anderson Cell lines Project (MCLP) across 19 tumor lineages. This allows us to comprehensively characterize commonalities and differences in network biology across tumor lineages to provide insight into the underlying biological mechanisms, and discovery of reliable unsupervised and supervised prediction models for relevant clinical and drug sensitivity outcomes -- to aid translational and precision medicine.",2018-06-08T12:06:00Z,2021-05-31T12:05:00Z,PAR-15-334,nofo_PAR-15-334,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,HOUSTON,TX,UNITED STATES,itcr
R21CA220352,Predicting the Presence of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer using Multiparametric MRI and MR-US Fusion Biopsy,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in American men, accounting for 26% of new cancer diagnoses and 9% of cancer deaths in men. Active surveillance, radical prostatectomy and radiotherapy are commonly used treatments for clinically localized prostate cancer. However, current risk stratification methods cannot be used effectively to avoid subjecting patients with clinically indolent cancers to unnecessary interventions, causing significant morbidity and cost. The primary components currently involved in screening are the digital rectal exam (DRE) and serum biomarkers, such as PSA, PCA3, PHI, and 4Kscore. Unfortunately, despite advances in these tests, overdiagnosis remains a major problem due to limited specificity. As a result, 90% of patients diagnosed with prostate cancer receive treatment, even though up to 60% of those patients could be candidates for active surveillance. Such treatment often results in long-term reductions in functional outcomes. The research objective of this R21 is to develop novel techniques using multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mp-MRI) and MRI-ultrasound (US) fusion guided biopsy data that provide discriminatory power in distinguishing indolent versus clinically significant prostatic adenocarcinoma based on non-invasive imaging. We propose to implement a multi-instance learning (MIL) based convolutional neural network (CNN) model for clinical prostate mp-MRI sequences to generate new quantitative imaging features representative of the underlying tissue. Our MIL-CNN model will accommodate ground truth labels from pathology whole mount specimens, as well as MRI-US fusion biopsy results. Hierarchical CNN features will be used to predict voxel- level cancer suspicion, thereby enabling a novel method for performing “imaging biopsy.” Finally, voxel-level suspicion maps will be aggregated into patient-level quantitative imaging biomarkers and combined with clinical data to create a multimodal nomogram for performing risk stratification.",2018-06-01T12:06:00Z,2021-05-31T12:05:00Z,PAR-15-334,nofo_PAR-15-334,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,LOS ANGELES,CA,UNITED STATES,itcr
R21CA220398,CGDnet: Cancer Gene Drug Network: Using patient-specific drug-gene networks for recommending targeted cancer therapies.,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Molecular profiling – the practice of molecularly testing tumors in order to find specific gene or protein alterations which can be used to recommend targeted therapies – is increasingly used in oncology and is fast becoming a major part of precision medicine. In practice, each patient or physician generally receives a list of molecular anomalies and a list of therapies which are predicted to be beneficial or not beneficial based on the tumor molecular profile. This may lead to a difficult process of prioritizing therapies for individual patients. In the current proposal, we will develop computational network-based approaches to therapy recommendation by using existing resources to inform the connections between drugs and gene or protein variants. We will consider approaches both for creating “average” networks based on population-level data and for creating “patient-specific” networks based on an individual’s specific tumor profile. We will also design and implement an interactive data visualization approach for these networks which will be usable by both clinical researchers and clinicians. The methods and tools developed as part of this project will be entirely reproducible and shared with the community via open-source software packages and interactive tools. We believe our project could eventually lead the way to improving the way therapies are targeted to cancer patients.",2017-06-06T12:06:00Z,2020-05-31T12:05:00Z,PAR-15-334,nofo_PAR-15-334,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,WASHINGTON,DC,UNITED STATES,itcr
R21CA220411,Somatic variant calling and phasing using colored de Bruijn graphs in heterogeneous tumors,"Abstract One of the central challenges in cancer genomics is the ability to accurately detect somatic mutations in heterogeneous tumors, and precisely determine which fraction of cancer cells harbor these mutations and at what frequency. Deeper understanding of the biological principals behind cancer evolution is central to the discovery of new cancer therapies. However, despite the tremendous advances in sequencing technologies over the last twenty years, most widely used computational approaches and biotechnologies still do not provide enough context to fully resolve the clonal structure in a tumor, due to a combination of low resolution, high cost, and prohibitive sample requirements. 10X Genomics has recently developed a new technology, called “linked reads”, that address some of these limitations by providing long-range phasing information at low cost and with minimal sample requirements. However, for this data to achieve its full potential and benefit the whole cancer research community, new computational tools must be developed combining novel algorithms for next- generation sequencing data analysis with the long-range information stored in the linked-reads. We propose to overcome these challenges by developing a new variant caller that combines the long-range information in the linked-reads with powerful colored de Bruijn graph data structures to accurately discover and phase inherited and somatic variants (SNVs and indels) in tumor-normal paired sequencing data. The colored de Bruijn graph approach will exploit the full information in the data by jointly analyzing reads coming from the tumor and the normal samples together. This will reduce the false-discovery rate of alignment-based variant caller when detecting longer insertions and deletions, without sacrificing the additional variant calling power provided by the assembly method. Furthermore, the linked-reads data will allow phasing of the variants and improve determination of subclonal structure by directly observing which variants are present on the same molecule, and therefore within the same subclone. We will develop and carefully test our novel variant calling framework using a combination of synthetic and genuine datasets designed to assess the variant calling abilities under diverse sequencing conditions, tumor clonality, and sequencing platforms.",2018-04-13T12:04:00Z,2020-03-31T12:03:00Z,PAR-15-334,nofo_PAR-15-334,NEW YORK GENOME CENTER,NEW YORK,NY,UNITED STATES,itcr
R21CA226106,Conservation and functional-characterization of tumor methylation sites,"We aim to develop statistical methods and software for analysis of DNA methylation data from human colorectal cancer samples [CRCs] and matched normal tissue. We hypothesize that because epigenetics determines mammalian cell phenotypes, it will be possible to reconstruct the phenotype of the tumor and its founder cell by comparing epigenomes sampled from opposite sides of the same CRC. Therefore, we will rank genes or cell pathways according to the degree of conservation of methylation status they exhibit, indicating which are likely to be most important during tumor growth. We propose three innovations to accomplish these goals. First, we exploit a new Illumina microarray which can measure methylation at ~850,000 CpG sites, allowing broad coverage of most human genes and enhancers. We will develop methods to enable us to conduct an analysis of such data. We will demonstrate this using a test dataset in which we have collected multi-regional sampling data (i.e., data in which we sample from a number of different parts of the same tumor) for 26 human colorectal tumors, along with paired samples of normal tissue for 6 of those patients and 9 other colons. Second, we propose a two-pronged attack designed to assess whether each CpG site should be classified as ‘stable’ or ‘unstable’ with respect to the degree of CpG variation permitted there. In Aim 1 we propose methods that are purely statistical in nature; In Aim 2 we propose methods that will be built upon an explicit mathematical model for tumor evolution. We will compare and contrast their results. An additional advantage of the second approach is that it will also allow us to reconstruct the epigenome of the founder cell. Third, we will assess conservation of variation within genes or pathways to assess which are most important during growth---pathways with smaller methylation differences between tumor sides are likely to be more important and under selective pressures. The significance of the proposed studies is that we will develop new methods to extract epigenetic information from multi-regional tumor sampling. Such data are rare at the moment, but will soon be routinely collected. For that reason, in our fourth aim we propose to produce and freely distributed software and Shiny applications. Our long-term goal is to facilitate more personalized and effective therapies that specifically target pathways or genes most important to the growth of individual CRCs. The development of methods and software to characterize variation in methylation patterns from multi-regional tumor sampling, and relate that to genes/pathways will facilitate this process, and the relative ease of obtaining epigenetic information using methylation arrays should allow widespread translation to other tumor types.",2019-03-01T12:03:00Z,2022-02-28T12:02:00Z,PAR-15-334,nofo_PAR-15-334,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,Los Angeles,CA,UNITED STATES,itcr
R21CA226188,Enhanced deconvolution and prediction of mutational signatures,"The goals of this proposal are to develop novel statistical tools and a software package for performing mutational signature deconvolution in cancer samples. Mutational signatures are patterns of co-occurring mutations that can reveal insights into a cancer's etiology and evolution. Currently, non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is the “gold-standard” for mutational signature deconvolution. However, NMF has several deficiencies in that it cannot do the following things: 1) easily characterize patterns within the flanking sequence beyond the trinucleotide context 2) simultaneously characterize patterns of several genomic features, and 3) predict mutational signatures of new samples given a previously trained model. In this proposal, we will develop a novel discrete Bayesian hierarchical model to characterize mutational signatures in tumor sequencing data that overcomes the limitations of NMF. These types of models are commonly used in text mining applications to infer topics by examining co-occurring word counts across documents. Our model will be able to characterize information about the flanking sequence far beyond the trinucleotide context, incorporate information from other genomic features such as strand or region, and predict signatures in single samples. Importantly, unlike NMF, the inclusion of extra genomic features in our clustering algorithm will not result in loss of power for discovery and will aid in prediction of mutational signatures targeted sequencing data by incorporating additional information. We will also develop an R/Bioconductor package for data preprocessing, inference, and visualization, which will streamline mutational signature analysis for researchers. Both NMF and our novel model will be available in the package so users can compare and contrast the different computational approaches for mutational signature inference. Interestingly, this package will have the capability to interface with several existing projects from the Informatics Technology for Cancer Research (ITCR) program. Finally, we will generate reference mutational signatures by analyzing a large-scale cancer exome sequencing dataset from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) that can be used to predict mutational signatures in single samples in clinical workflows. Overall, our model will be of great interest to the cancer community as it will provide greater insights into mutational signature patterns and will be useful in clinical settings where mutational signature inference is performed in single samples.",2019-03-01T12:03:00Z,2022-02-28T12:02:00Z,PAR-15-334,nofo_PAR-15-334,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,BOSTON,MA,UNITED STATES,itcr
R21CA231853,Inferring Kinase Activity Profiles from Phosphoproteomic Data,"Project Summary Phosphorylation can regulate protein function, which is a cornerstone of normal tissue development and home- ostasis. However, kinases, the enzymes that catalyze protein phosphorylation, are often dysregulated in cancer. Recently, advances have been made to measure global phosphorylation within human patient tumor samples. The hope is that this data holds the key to identifying patient-speciﬁc targets in cancer therapy. Unfortunately, challenges exist in interpreting phosphorylation data and its reﬂection of the underlying dysregulation of signaling networks. The goal of this project is to develop an algorithm that translates the measurements of phosphorylation in human samples to a prediction of kinase activity proﬁles. The kinase activity proﬁles could then be used to iden- tify new targets and classify tumor types. This goal will be achieved by: the development of graph-based score, based on predicted kinase-substrate relationships, interpretation of that score through statistical frameworks, and testing and improvement of the algorithms on available control and patient data.",2018-08-03T12:08:00Z,2021-07-31T12:07:00Z,PAR-15-334,nofo_PAR-15-334,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,CHARLOTTESVILLE,VA,UNITED STATES,itcr
R21CA231892,Bayesian learning algorithms for identifying and classifying heterogeneity of cell types in variety of solid tumors,"Abstract Solid tumors are comprise the large majority of cancers (>90%). Standard of diagnosis and care often involved serial MR imaging for monitoring tumor response. It is not well understood how heterogeneity at the cellular and molecular levels affects the macroscopic imaging characteristics of these tumors. The long-term goal of this project is to provide computation tools for understanding the histopathologic variation of solid tumors and aid the development of image guided therapies for individualizing solid tumor treatment. The overall objective is to combine radiographic imaging with histopathological samples (i.e., radio-pathomics) to create and validate predictive tools for accurately defining tumor margins and spatial molecular profiles. Our central hypothesis is that microscopic cytological features and spatially dependent molecular profiles are reliably detectable and quantifiable with macroscopic MR imaging and that they can contribute towards the development of adaptive radiation therapy (ART). Two specific aims will objectively test this hypothesis by first determining which microscopic tissue features contribute to distinct measurements with MR imaging, and second, determining the development of fast and accurate computational tools for using MR image guided radiation therapy in clinical settings.",2018-09-01T12:09:00Z,2021-08-31T12:08:00Z,PAR-15-334,nofo_PAR-15-334,MEDICAL COLLEGE OF WISCONSIN,MILWAUKEE,WI,UNITED STATES,itcr
R21CA231904,An Ontology-driven Faceted Query Engine for the Kentucky Cancer Registry,"ABSTRACT A key barrier in cancer research is the traditional data access workflow that requires a hypothesis prior to accessing patient data, rather than a workflow that begins with data exploration while protecting privacy. Existing query engines allow researchers to explore clinical data, build queries, and execute queries without the need for the user to understand how the data is stored. However, the interfaces of such query engines have not achieved usability approaching the levels of those for consumer websites due in critical part to the lack of faceted capabilities. Faceted systems for querying clinical data is currently unavailable due to the complexity of data and the mismatch between the ontologies used for organizing and annotating clinical data (such as NCI Thesaurus), and the desired facet structures and properties. We propose to overcome these challenges by developing OncoSphere, a query engine using the NCI Thesaurus as a nested facet system (NFS) to provide web-based exploration of the Kentucky Cancer Registry data using 3 Specific Aims. In Aim 1 we will develop an approach to transform and implement NCI Thesaurus into an NFS to enable OncoSphere’s interface features. In Aim 2 we will develop methods to perform quality auditing on the hierarchical structure of the NCI Thesaurus to enhance its quality in supporting faceted query for OncoSphere. In Aim 3 we will perform evaluation on OncoSphere’s query expressiveness, query performance and conduct preliminary usability assessment. OncoSphere will break new ground in web-based tools and capitalize on available data resources to accelerate cancer research. We expect OncoSphere and its future versions to become an invaluable resource for the cancer research community. The long-term goal of this study is to create data exploration systems for NCI’s Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program and other related cancer data resources through data science innovations to transform user experience with a new generation of data interaction modalities.",2018-06-06T12:06:00Z,2021-07-31T12:07:00Z,PAR-15-334,nofo_PAR-15-334,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,HOUSTON,TX,UNITED STATES,itcr
R21CA231911,STAN-CT: Standardization and Normalization of CT images for Lung Cancer Patients,"Project Summary/Abstract Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death and one of the most common cancers among both men and women in the United States. Recent advances in high-resolution imaging set the stage for radiomics to become an active emerging field in cancer research. However, the promise of radiomics is limited by a lack of image standardization tools, because computed tomography (CT) images are often acquired using scanners from different vendors with customized acquisition parameters, posing a fundamental challenge to radiomic studies across sites. To overcome this challenge, especially for large-scale, multi-site radiomic studies, advanced algorithms are required to integrate, standardize, and normalize CT images from multiple sources. We propose to develop STAN-CT, a deep learning software package that can automatically standardize and normalize a large volume of diagnostic images to facilitate cross-site large-scale image feature extraction for lung cancer characterization and stratification. By precisely mitigating the differences in advanced radiomic features of CT images, STAN-CT will overcome research silos and promote medical image resource sharing, ultimately improving the diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer. Our goal will be achieved through two Aims. In Aim 1, we will develop a working prototype to standardize CT images. First, we will collect raw image data from lung cancer patients and reconstruct CT images using multiple image reconstruction parameters, and we will scan a multipurpose chest phantom along with five different nodule inserts. Then, we will develop and train STAN-CT for CT image standardization. An alternative training architecture will be developed to achieve the improved model training stability. In Aim 2. We will deploy and test STAN-CT for image standardization locally and across three medical centers. First, we will make the STAN-CT software package available to the public by providing a menu-driven web-interface so that that users can conveniently convert medical images that were taken using non-standard protocols to one or multiple standards that they specify. Second, we will deploy STAN-CT at the University of Kentucky for local performance validation. We will test the functionality, reliability, and performance of STAN-CT using both patient chest CT image data collected at large-scale and the phantom image data, both independent to training. Third, we will deploy and test STAN-CT at the University of Kentucky as well as the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center and Emory University for cross- center performance validation. We will use the same multipurpose chest phantom and both standard and non- standard protocols to validate STAN-CT at the three centers. We will test the generalizability of STAN-CT using clinical CT images of human patients and will determine whether a model trained using the data from one medical center are applicable for images collected at another place. Finally, we will distribute the software package of STAN-CT for public use. STAN-CT will enable a wide range of radiomic researches to identify diagnostic image features that strongly associated with lung cancer prognosis.",2019-07-01T12:07:00Z,2022-06-30T12:06:00Z,PAR-15-334,nofo_PAR-15-334,UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY,LEXINGTON,KY,UNITED STATES,itcr
R21CA237493,Development and Dissemination of KiNet: A Novel Imaging Informatics Tool for Gastrointestinal and Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors,"PROJECT SUMMARY Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are one heterogeneous type of cancer affecting most organ systems. NETs must be correctly graded to ensure proper treatment and patient management. The proliferation index, as measured by Ki67 nuclear staining, is required for gastrointestinal (GI) and pancreatic NET grading per the criteria of the World Health Organization (WHO). Measuring the Ki67 labeling index (Ki67 LI) from pathology images requires accurate quantification of immunopositive tumor, immunonegative tumor and non-tumor cells. This process is an essential procedure in basic, translational and clinical research and in routine clinical practice. However, current Ki67 image analysis tools have a number of drawbacks: 1) Ki67 LI assessment is still mainly achieved with manual or semi-automated methods, leading to increased labor costs, awkward workflows, low-throughput image analysis and significant potential inter- and intra-observer variability; 2) computer-aided Ki67 counting is error-prone due to the multi-stage image processing design, where each stage itself is a very challenging task; 3) current algorithm design does not take into consideration the characteristics of Ki67 images such that it has technical difficulty in classifying different types of cells in Ki67 stained images. In this proposed research, we seek to develop and disseminate a novel deep learning-based imaging informatics system, KiNeT, specifically for better automated Ki67 LI measurement in GI and pancreatic NETs. KiNet will take advantage of cutting-edge machine learning algorithms, deep fully convolutional networks (FCNs), to develop an end-to-end, pixel-to-pixel model for single-stage Ki67 LI assessment. To this end, we will first formulate Ki67 counting as a cell identification problem and solve it using class-aware structured regression modeling within a novel FCN network. This network will simultaneously detect and classify immunopositive tumor, immunonegative tumor and non-tumor cells. Next, we will further enhance cell identification with another related task, extraction of regions of interest (ROIs), which will differentiate tumor from non-tumor regions by taking Ki67 image characteristics into consideration. These two tasks will be unified into one single neural network and jointly learned to benefit both cell identification and region classification. KiNet will provide a novel computational method for accurate Ki67 LI assessment, thereby enabling early detection and targeted treatments of the diseases. Compared to manual counting and current Ki67 image analysis methods, it will significantly improve the objectivity, consistency, reliability, reproducibility and efficiency. Additionally, the proposed single-stage Ki67 counting strategy, which is completely different from current multi-stage Ki67 image analysis pipelines, will provide a new perspective for Ki67 image quantification.",2019-04-02T12:04:00Z,2022-03-31T12:03:00Z,PAR-15-334,nofo_PAR-15-334,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,Aurora,CO,UNITED STATES,itcr
R21CA237686,Personalized dosimetry for liver cancer radioembolization using fluid dynamics simulation,"Project Summary/ Abstract Liver cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer deaths with rising incidence in the U.S and worldwide. Yttrium-90 microspheres radioembolization, or Selective Internal Radiation Therapy (SIRT), is a treatment in which a catheter inserted in the patient's hepatic artery delivers radioactive 90Y microspheres to the liver. It is increasingly utilized to treat patients with unresectable liver tumors in second or third line, but some of its potential to improve overall survival is still untapped. The major obstacle in making SIRT more efficient is the treatment planning. It consists in selecting the 90Y activity to inject based on the estimated dose to the tumor and organs-at-risk. The problem is that the dose calculation is highly unreliable and does not include important parameters, such as well-known non-uniformities or the injection point. As a result, physicians often choose very conservative dosage to limit toxicity at the expense of the tumor(s) dose, which drastically reduces SIRT efficacy. The objective of this project is to develop accurate patient-specific dosimetry for SIRT planning. We propose a novel method combining computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to simulate the 90Y microsphere 3D distribution and 90Y physics modeling to predict the absorbed dose. The central and novel approach is to carry out the CFD simulations for each patient's hepatic arterial tree to achieve high accuracy and precision, because anatomical features determining the microsphere distribution present wide variations across the patient population and prohibit the use of generic models. This novel CFD-based dosimetry will be the first comprehensive tool to integrate (1) the hepatic arterial tree extracted from the patient's standard-of-care angiogram, (2) CFD simulation in this hepatic arterial tree to predict and optimize the microsphere distribution, (3) calculation of the absorbed dose with 90Y physics modeling. Our long-term goal is developing a tool that can be integrated in clinical workflow to optimize the quantity and injection point of 90Y microspheres during SIRT planning. To this end, we will pursue two specific aims. (1) We will develop the CFD model and dose calculation using a pig model for validation; (2) we will develop a deep learning approach to simultaneously segment the hepatic artery from the standard-of-care patient angiograms and conduct a morphometric study of the obtained hepatic arterial trees to identify the principal parameters affecting the model. If successful, this project will generate a reliable, patient-specific dosimetry for SIRT providing a comprehensive calculation of the absorbed dose in individual lesions as well as in the healthy liver. This will enable high precision treatment planning to better treat the tumors with a “dose-painting” approach and ultimately improve long-term patient outcome.",2019-04-01T12:04:00Z,2022-03-31T12:03:00Z,PAR-15-334,nofo_PAR-15-334,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,DAVIS,CA,UNITED STATES,itcr
R21CA242861,A statistical framework to systematically characterize cancer driver mutations in noncoding genomic regions,"PROJECT SUMMARY Cancer genomes typically harbor a substantial number of somatic mutations. Relatively few driver mutations actually alter the function of proteins in tumor cells, whereas most mutations are considered to be functionally neutral passenger mutations. Over the past decade, the search for cancer driver mutations has focused on coding regions and several mutational significance algorithms have been developed for coding mutations. The contribution of mutations in noncoding regulatory regions to tumor formation largely remains unknown and current mutational significance algorithms are not designed to detect driver mutations in noncoding regions, due to biological differences between coding and noncoding mutations. The emerging availability of large whole- genome sequencing datasets (e.g. PCAWG and HMF datasets) creates an ample opportunity to develop new mutational significance algorithms that are particularly designed for the interpretation of noncoding regions. Recently, we have developed a new statistical approach that identifies driver mutations in coding regions based on the nucleotide context. Critically, consideration of the nucleotide context around mutations does not require prior knowledge for functional consequences associated with these mutations. Hence, we hypothesize that generalizing our nucleotide context model to noncoding regions will uncover novel noncoding driver mutations that cannot be detected using the mutational significance approaches currently available. For this purpose, we will develop a statistical framework that incorporates the biological differences between coding and noncoding mutations and that is specifically designed to detect driver mutations in noncoding regions. Specifically, we will consider the context-dependent distribution of passenger mutations, modeling of the background mutation rate, accurately partition the background mutation rate, model the sequence composition of the reference genome, and account for coverage fluctuation. We will then combine these statistical components by computing an independent product of their underlying probabilities. We will derive a significance p-value using a Monte-Carlo simulation approach, and use FDR for multiple hypothesis test correction. This strategy will allow us to accurately estimate the significance of somatic mutations in noncoding genomic regions. We will next apply this statistical framework to whole-genome sequencing data of 5,523 tumor patients, thereby deriving a comprehensive list of candidate driver mutations in noncoding regions. Finally, we will investigate whether noncoding mutations are overrepresented in transcription factor binding sites, regulate gene expression levels, induce alternative splicing, or affect epigenomic states. Upon the completion of this project, we will have developed and applied a statistical framework for discovery of significant somatic mutations in noncoding regions, and defined the mutational landscape of the non-coding cancer genome. All aspects of the methods developed and applied in this project will be made open source and developed in an online platform.",2019-07-01T12:07:00Z,2021-12-31T12:12:00Z,PAR-15-334,nofo_PAR-15-334,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,BOSTON,MA,UNITED STATES,itcr
R21CA242933,Data-driven QSP software for personalized colon cancer treatment,"Abstract Colon cancer is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States in both men and women. A major clinical challenge is to obtain an effective treatment strategy for each patient or at least identify a subset of patients who could beneﬁt from a particular treatment. Since each colon cancer has its own unique features, it is very important to obtain personalized cancer treatments and ﬁnd a way to tailor treatment strategies for each patient based on each individual's characteristics, including race, gender, genetic factors, immune response variations. Recently, Quantitative and Systems Pharmacology (QSP) has been commonly used to discover, validate, and test drugs. QSP models are a system of differential equations that model the dynamic interactions between drug(s) and a biological system. These mathematical models provide an integrated “systems level” approach to determining mechanisms of action of drugs and ﬁnding new ways to alter complex cellular networks with mono or combination therapy to obtain effective treatments. Since QSP models are a complex system of nonlinear equations with many unknown parameters, estimating the values of the model's parameters is extremely difﬁcult. Existing parameter estimation methods for QSP models often use assembled data from various sources rather than a single curated dataset. These datasets are usually obtained through various biological experiments, in vitro and in vivo animal studies, thus rendering QSP models hard to be practicable for personalized treatments. To the best of our knowledge, no QSP model has been developed for personalized colon cancer treatments. In this project, we propose a unique approach to develop a data-driven QSP software to suggest effective treatment for each patient based on gene expression data from the primary tumor samples. Since signatures of main characteristics of tumors, such as immune response variations, can be found in gene expression proﬁling of primary tumors, we use gene expression data as input. We develop an innovative framework to systematically employ a combination of data science, mathematical, and statistical methods to obtain personalized colon cancer treatment. We employ novel inverse problem techniques to estimate the values of parameters of the model and statistical methods to perform sensitivity analysis. We will use these techniques to propose an optimal treatment strategy for each patient and predict the efﬁcacy of the proposed treatment. The model might also suggest alternative therapies in case of low efﬁcacy for some patients.",2019-09-01T12:09:00Z,2022-08-31T12:08:00Z,PAR-15-334,nofo_PAR-15-334,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST,HADLEY,MA,UNITED STATES,itcr
R21CA242940,Semi-supervised Algorithms for Risk Assessment with Noisy EHR Data,"PROJECT SUMMARY Large electronic health record research (EHR) data integrated with -omics data from linked biorepositories have expanded opportunities for precision medicine research. These integrated datasets open opportunities for developing accurate EHR-based personalized cancer risk and progression prediction models, which can be easily incorporated into clinical practice and ultimately realize the promise of precision oncology. However, efficiently and effectively using EHR for cancer research remains challenging due to practical and methodological obstacles. For example, obtaining precise event time information such as time of cancer recurrence is a major bottleneck in using EHR for precision medicine research due to the requirement of laborious medical record review and the lack of documentation. Simple estimates of the event time based on billing or procedure codes may poorly approximate the true event time. Naive use of such estimated event times can lead to highly biased estimates due to the approximation error. Such biases impose challenges to performing pragmatic trials when the study endpoint is time to events and captured using EHR. The overall goal of this proposal is to fill these methodological gaps in risk assessment for cancer research using EHR data, which will advance our ability to achieve the promise of precision oncology. Statistical algorithms and software will be developed to (i) automatically assign event time information using longitudinally recorded EHR information; and (ii) to perform accurate risk assessment using noisy proxies of event times. The proposed tools for risk assessment using imperfect EHR data without requiring extensive manual chart review could greatly improve the utility of EHR for oncology research.",2019-07-01T12:07:00Z,2022-06-30T12:06:00Z,PAR-15-334,nofo_PAR-15-334,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,BOSTON,MA,UNITED STATES,itcr
R21CA248118,A Computational Method to Calculate the Radiation Dose to Circulating Lymphocytes,"There is growing enthusiasm in response to emerging data that combining immunotherapy with radiation therapy (RT) can increase response rates. However, persistent immunosuppression caused by radiation itself appears to limit this synergy. The effects of the exact RT delivery parameters (radiation modality, fractionation scheme, daily radiation exposure time and radiation dose rate) on the patient’s lymphocytes remain unknown, and there are currently no methods to calculate the radiation dose to circulating lymphocytes. The objective of this proposal is to develop a computational model to simulate the radiation dose to the lymphocyte population during intracranial irradiation based on vascular segmentation (SA1). The blood flow in the rest of the body will be modeled by a simplified Markov chain formalism. This will be combined with the patient-specific, time-dependent dose delivery information to simulate the dose to the circulating lymphocytes using a generalized Monte-Carlo approach. Furthermore we will validate our computational framework in patients treated with (conventional) photon and proton therapy. Due to the different dose distributions and time courses between proton and photon patients, we will be able to correlate the measured depletion in vivo to the patient-specific lymphocyte dose calculation to validate our computational model (SA2). Quantifying the dose delivered to the lymphocytes has great clinical potential and actionable significance because of the ease to modify radiation delivery parameters. Accurate knowledge of this effect would be transformative for the implementation of immunotherapy trials that are augmented with RT (>100 trials currently recruiting patients). Accurate dosimetry for circulating lymphocytes can control for variability among patients and will be key for the correct interpretation of trial results.",2020-08-01T12:08:00Z,2022-11-17T12:11:00Z,RFA-CA-19-038,nofo_RFA-CA-19-038,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,BOSTON,MA,UNITED STATES,itcr
R21CA248122,Inference of tumor growth dynamics using genomic data,"ABCTRACT Heterogeneity and evolvability are hallmarks of cancer. By the time of detection, a typical tumor comprises of billions of malignant cells that belong to multiple distinct subclonal cell populations, which trace their evolutionary lineage back to a single tumor initiating cell. Subclones arise at different time-points during tumor progression, and their population sizes grow (or in some cases shrink) with time. Quantitative assessment of subclonal growth rates of tumors can indicate the mode of disease progression, predict the risk of emergence of resistance, and can rationally guide clinical management of the patients in the Precision Medicine setting. It remains unclear whether the genetically distinct subclones in heterogeneous tumors tend to have major differences in fitness and growth rates in vivo, or most subclones grow comparably, as predicted by the neutral evolution model. This is due to a number of technical challenges. Patho-genomic profiling of biopsies and resected tumors provide limited and incomplete snapshots of cancer progression; much of the tumor evolution and clonal growth dynamics therein remain unobserved. Pathological assessment can indicate overall proliferative characteristics of a tumor but cannot attribute them to individual subclones and oncogenic driver mutations therein. Genomic approaches for delineating clonal architectures in tumors, or genetic and non- genetic heterogeneity also do not provide direct, quantitative estimates of subclonal growth rates. Incorrect measurements of intra-tumor subclonal properties have led to biased inference about tumor evolution and fueled controversies on multiple occasions - highlighting the immediate need for development of reliable resource in this area. To address this unmet need, this proposal aims to develop a novel framework to estimate subclonal growth rates in human tumors using emerging genomic approaches, and then validate them experimentally before applying the framework to estimate the selective advantage conferred by oncogenic drivers during tumor progression in individual patients. The resources developed in this proposal will enable us to revisit the ongoing debate about the neutral evolution and selection in cancer, and also help refine clinically relevant predictive models of tumor progression to generate testable hypotheses.",2020-05-15T12:05:00Z,2023-04-30T12:04:00Z,RFA-CA-19-038,nofo_RFA-CA-19-038,RBHS -CANCER INSTITUTE OF NEW JERSEY,NEW BRUNSWICK,NJ,UNITED STATES,itcr
R21CA253394,Optimizing the Population Representativeness of Older Adults in Cancer Trials,"ABSTRACT Clinical trials are often conducted under idealized and rigorously controlled conditions to ensure internal validity, but such conditions, paradoxically, compromise trials external validity (i.e., generalizability to the target population). Low generalizability has long been a concern and widely documented, especially, in cancer research community. Certain population subgroups, such as older adults, are often underrepresented in cancer studies due to [[overly restrictive (and potentially unjustified) exclusion criteria,]] which are arguably the biggest yet modifiable barriers causing low generalizability. Regulatory agencies (e.g., FDA), funding agencies (e.g., NCI), and research communities (e.g., ASCO) have called and provided guidance to broaden trial eligibility criteria to promote enrollment practices so that trials can better reflecting the population most likely to use the drug if approved. Nevertheless, trial sponsors and investigators are reluctant to broaden eligibility criteria due to concerns over potential increases in the risk of serious adverse events (SAEs) and their negative impact on the investigational drug’s safety and effectiveness profile. As a consequence, in cancer trials, elderlies are often excluded implicitly through excluding clinical characteristics that are more prevalent in the elderly. There is a gap between the need to broaden trial criteria and ways available to [[identify unjustified, overly restrictive exclusion criteria and then adjust them accordingly in practice]]. Previous studies, including ours, have validated and used the Generalizability Index of Study Traits (GIST), the best available quantitative, eligibility-driven, a priori generalizability measure, in a number of disease domains. GIST scores can potentially be used to guide adjustments to criteria towards better population representativeness. However, there are key barriers for its adoption in practice, especially in cancer trials: (1) the lack of a standardized, computable eligibility criteria (CEC) framework to translate criteria to data queries – a necessary step to define the populations for generalizability assessment, (2) the lack of a validation study that assesses GIST’s reliability and validity in cancer trials, and (3) the need to map the mathematical relationships between eligibility criteria and GIST as well as patient outcomes (i.e. SAE), which answers the critical question how broadened criteria will affect trial’s generalizability and patient outcomes simultaneously. To remove these barriers, we will systematically analyze existing female breast, lung, and colorectal trials in clinicaltrails.gov to create an ontology-driven, standardized library of CEC, validate GIST among cancer trials, and develop [[statistical models on how adjustments to eligibility criteria, especially those that limit the participation of older adults]], would affect (1) trial generalizability measured by GIST, and (2) outcomes (i.e., SAEs) of the target population, approximated using a large collection of real-world data (RWD) source – the OneFlorida network, that contains linked EHRs, claims, and cancer registry data for ~15 million Floridians.",2021-04-08T12:04:00Z,2024-03-31T12:03:00Z,RFA-CA-20-007,nofo_RFA-CA-20-007,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,GAINESVILLE,FL,UNITED STATES,itcr
R21CA253408,Cancer-specific gene set testing,"PROJECT SUMMARY Cancer develops when pathways controlling cell survival, cell fate or genome maintenance are disrupted by the somatic alteration of key driver genes. Understanding the mechanism and impact of pathway dis- ruption is therefore essential for an accurate characterization of cancer biology and identification of ther- apeutic targets. A common approach for studying pathway dysregulation in cancer involves the analysis of tumor gene expression data using gene set testing or pathway analysis techniques. Gene set testing is an effective and widely applied hypothesis aggregation method that uses prior knowledge regarding gene function to test a smaller number of more biologically meaningful hypotheses and thereby improve interpretation, replication and power relative to a gene-level analysis. Although the gene set analysis of large cancer gene expression data sets has successfully identified pathways commonly impacted in human cancer, existing pathway analysis methods have two important limitations when applied to can- cer gene expression data. First, most existing gene set collections model the pattern of gene activity found in normal tissues, which can differ significantly from the pattern found within tumors. Using these gene sets to analyze cancer gene expression data can result in misleading results with the potential for a significantly inflated type II error rate. Second, standard gene set testing methods leverage only the gene expression data for the analyzed samples. Although there are some cancer-specific pathway analysis methods that consider multiple omics modalities, e.g., expression and mutations, information regarding the expression of genes in the associated normal tissue is not utilized by existing techniques. Ignoring normal tissue gene expression can result in a cancer-focused analysis that simply recapitulates the phenotype of the associated normal tissue rather than capturing cancer-specific activity. To address these challenges, we will develop novel and innovative bioinformatics algorithms that 1) optimize exist- ing gene set collections to reflect the pattern of gene activity found in dysplastic tissue, and 2) leverage information regarding normal tissue gene activity during gene set analysis.",2020-09-01T12:09:00Z,2024-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-19-038,nofo_RFA-CA-19-038,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,HANOVER,NH,UNITED STATES,itcr
R21CA253498,PRISTINE: Pre-cancer histology identification of Endobronchial biopsies using deep learning,"PROJECT SUMMARY Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death. In order to increase survival, therapies are urgently needed to intercept the cancer development process and decrease the rate of patients presenting with advanced disease. A potential promising point of interception is to develop therapies to reverse or delay the development of lung premalignant lesions (PMLs). About 20% of lung cancers arise in the epithelial layer of the bronchial airways and these are preceded by the development of PMLs that are important clinical indicators of lung cancer risk in the airways or at remote parenchymal sites. As part of the NCI-Moonshot our group is engaged in creating a multi-omic lung Pre-Cancer Atlas (PCA). The success of this project in creating clinically relevant biomarkers and therapeutics depends on accurate assessments of histology and immune infiltrates in PMLs. Currently, however, pathologic assessment of the morphological stages of increasing abnormality from hyperplasia, metaplasia, dysplasia (mild, moderate, and severe), to invasive carcinoma is challenging and not routine. The objective of the proposed study is to develop and disseminate a computationally efficient deep learning framework to annotate a variety of histologic features in PMLs from the Lung PCA and associate these features with clinical and genomic data. Our central hypothesis is that deep learning can be applied to digitized H&E whole slide images (WSIs) of bronchial PMLs to identify a comprehensive set of histologic features and metrics summarizing their spatial organization that may enhance biomarkers of PML progression to cancer. We will test this hypothesis by pursuing two specific aims. First, we will annotate PMLs and develop a semantic segmentation framework using deep learning to predict histologic features of PMLs. Second, we will disseminate our deep learning framework and show its utility in enhancing PML-associated biomarkers. The proposed study is significant because the framework we develop can be applied to predict other features in the WSIs from PMLs and be modified to encompass other PMLs of the lung (e.g. those associated with lung adenocarcinoma) as well as other premalignant lesions found in other epithelial tissue types such as breast, colon, prostate, etc. Currently, deep learning approaches have not been applied to PMLs, and this proposal is innovative in the unique clinical specimens that it leverages with corresponding genomic and clinical data and in its development of a patch- based convolutional neural network to predict histologic features of PMLs. Our long-term goal is to develop a deep learning framework to predict a variety of features from lung PML WSIs and integrate these with genomic data on these same samples to discover robust biomarkers of PML progression and therapeutics to prevent invasive cancer development.",2020-09-01T12:09:00Z,2024-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-19-038,nofo_RFA-CA-19-038,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,BOSTON,MA,UNITED STATES,itcr
R21CA258242,Extraction of Symptom Burden from Clinical Narratives of Cancer Patients using Natural Language Processing,"Project Summary / Abstract Cancer patients frequently experience high levels of pain, tiredness, shortness of breath, decreased appetite, nausea, drowsiness, anxiety, and decreased sense of wellbeing, often related to the disease itself, its treatments, or both. This high symptom burden leads to significant impairment of cancer patients’ quality of life and may be associated with impaired survival. Optimal symptom management is required to minimize symptom burden and maximize quality of life for cancer patients throughout the course of their disease. Supportive care in cancer (SCC) teams are multidisciplinary teams that are focused on the prevention and management of the adverse effects of cancer and its treatments across the continuum of the cancer experience from diagnosis through treatment and beyond. These teams typically lack the resources to see all cancer patients and need to prioritize patients with the highest need, often relying on oncology physicians for referral. However, oncology physicians are often too focused on curing cancer than treating its symptoms. As a result, SCC services are often accessed by chance even when available, often later in the cancer trajectory. To improve recognition of SCC needs and to identify the symptom burden of cancer patients for better management and care, we propose to build natural language processing (NLP) approaches that can automatically extract symptom information from unstructured narratives. The proposed systems will utilize neural nets and build on the state of the art information extraction methods. To accomplish our goals, we will create a dataset of clinical notes for a large cohort of prostate cancer and Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) patients treated in Seattle Cancer Care Alliance (SCCA) and Huntsman Cancer Institute (HCI) between 1.1.2015 and 1.1.2020. We focus on these two types of cancer as examples of two very different and prevalent cancer types. We propose to represent symptom burden documented in clinical narratives with a generalizable frame representation that captures fine-grained details including presence/absence, change-of- state, severity, characteristics, duration, frequency, and anatomy information related to patient symptoms. We will use active learning to create a diverse and representative gold standard annotated with symptom frames to train and test the proposed neural-based NLP approaches. All models and their implementations produced during the execution of this project will be shared with the community as open source resources. After successful completion of the project, the developed NLP methods will be integrated into the information access methods of SCCA and HCI clinical repositories.",2021-05-19T12:05:00Z,2024-04-30T12:04:00Z,RFA-CA-20-007,nofo_RFA-CA-20-007,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,SEATTLE,WA,UNITED STATES,itcr
R21CA258493,Computerized platform for interactive annotation and topological characterization of tumor associated vasculature for predicting response to immunotherapy in lung cancer,"SUMMARY: The tumor microenvironment (TME) vascular network harbors a compelling amount of anatomical and physiological information embedded on the imaging scale. Although techniques like Radiomics have shown significant promise in several medical imaging applications, such approaches are limited to capturing properties such as lesion morphology and texture, and cannot comprehensively characterize or visualize the properties of the aberrant TME vasculature. We hypothesize that angiogenesis manifests as characteristic topological and geometrical patterns of vasculature in the nodule periphery, and is associated with disease progression and outcome. In this project, we propose to leverage these topological and geometrical constructs in building adaptive segmentation, quantification, and visualization tools for tumor associated vasculature. To demonstrate the clinical efficacy of these new tools in therapy response assessment, we propose to target unmet clinical needs in response prediction of lung immunotherapy. Fewer than 20% non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) respond favorably. Additionally, the associated costs are extremely high. Molecular markers and metrics evaluating changes in tumor size have not been very effective in predicting and monitoring response to ICIs. Intra- and peritumoral radiomic features have been recently shown to outperform traditional biomarkers in outcome prediction. None of the existing markers, however, consider the tumor associated vasculature in the clinical assessment of TME despite strong evidence of its role in determining disease progression and response to therapy. One critical obstacle is the lack of an efficient and easy-to-use 3- dimensional (D) vasculature annotation tool for clinicians. Despite rich literature, it is difficult to train an automatic segmentation model due of the highly heterogeneous and complex 3D morphology of vasculature. This is especially challenging near nodule periphery, where the pathological vasculature exhibits abnormal yet clinically relevant geometry and topology. We aim to 1) build a human-in-the-loop vasculature visualization and segmentation framework based on topological active learning, 2) characterize the topology and geometry of the extracted vessels to obtain a set of novel vascular radiomic markers, and 3) use the developed suite of quantitative vascular biomarkers to establish a risk scoring system for predicting clinical benefit for NSCLC patients undergoing ICI therapy. Specifically, these tools will be optimized to identify patients who will benefit from ICIs on pre-treatment CT. A major strength of our work is to provide clinicians an intuitive informatics platform to visualize topological and geometrical attributes of aberrant vasculature, thereby enabling them to better understand the role of vessel architecture in disease progression from a phenotypic perspective. The team will train these biologically interpretable radiomic tools using a learning set of N=120 NSCLC patients treated with ICI therapy at Stony Brook University Hospital. The developed tools will then be validated on a cohort of N=300 patients, treated at University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center.",2022-05-01T12:05:00Z,2024-04-30T12:04:00Z,RFA-CA-21-013,nofo_RFA-CA-21-013,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,STONY BROOK,NY,UNITED STATES,itcr
R21CA263704,A novel algorithm to compute adherence from electronic adherence monitoring devices,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Medication adherence is a current scientific priority of the National Cancer Institute and a top priority in clinical trials. Electronic adherence monitoring devices (EAMDs) are pill bottles or boxes that contain a computer chip that records the dates and times of each bottle/box opening (or “actuation”). Due to their accuracy and ability to capture day-to-day medication-taking behavior, EAMDs are increasingly cited (i.e., by the FDA) as the preferred measure of daily anticancer medication adherence in research. Unfortunately, researchers currently lack the tools they need to accurately and efficiently convert raw EAMD actuations into adherence data and current methods of completing this task are unstandardized, error-prone, and burdensome. The purpose of this R21 is to develop a novel algorithm to convert EAMD actuations into adherence data. To maximize potential uptake and usability, we will engage a multidisciplinary adherence science focus group to inform the design of the algorithm and associated user interface (Aim 1). We will then evaluate the accuracy of the algorithm in classifying daily adherence data (Aim 2) and obtain quality of use feedback (Aim 3) to inform final refinements prior to large-scale testing.",2022-09-06T12:09:00Z,2024-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-21-013,nofo_RFA-CA-21-013,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,CINCINNATI,OH,UNITED STATES,itcr
R21CA264257,Curve-free phase I/II clinical trial designs for molecularly targeted agents and immunotherapy,"Project Summary/Abstract The primary goal of this proposal is to develop transparent, ﬂexible and efﬁcient phase I/II clinical trial designs identifying optimal doses for molecularly targeted agents (MTA) and immunotherapy (IT). Conventional phase I/II clinical trial designs often use sophisticated parametric models to characterize the joint toxicity-efﬁcacy distribu- tions and to conduct the trials. However, the parametric models are hard to justify in practice, and misspeciﬁcation of parametric models can lead to substantially undesirable performances of phase I/II trials. Moreover, it is difﬁcult for the physicians conducting the trials to clinically interpret the parameters of these sophisticated models, and such great learning costs impede the translation of novel statistical designs into real-world trial implementation. To solve these issues, in this proposal we will propose transparent curve-free phase I/II clinical trial designs. The proposed designs make no parametric assumptions on either dose-response relationship or toxicity-efﬁcacy correlation and therefore performs robustly under any clinically meaningful dose-response curves. The concise clinically interpretable model expression and dose-ﬁnding algorithm make the proposed designs highly transla- tional from the statistical community to the clinical community. The proposed designs are also highly ﬂexible because they are applicable for both single-agent trial and drug-combination trial with either quickly observable outcomes or delayed outcomes. The preliminary simulation studies show that the proposed designs are highly efﬁcient in optimal dose selection and patient allocation. In addition, we will develop user-friendly web apps to facilitate the widespread application of the proposed designs in clinical practice.",2021-09-17T12:09:00Z,2024-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-20-007,nofo_RFA-CA-20-007,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,INDIANAPOLIS,IN,UNITED STATES,itcr
R21CA264339,A deep-transfer-learning framework to transfer clinical information to single cells and spatial locations in cancer tissues,"SUMMARY In the past 10 years, there has been an explosion of new high-resolution molecular data which revolutionize the way that cancer is understood and treated. They include, single cell transcriptomics, spatial transcriptomics, and computational image analysis. However, the study of the association of those data with clinical outcomes such as survival, relapse, metastasis and drug response were left behind. In the meantime, Deep learning field is maturing very fast with many diverse applications including on biological data. It frequently utilizes multi-layer neural network models to learn and extract highly non-linear representations of data. Transfer learning is the subfield of machine learning, which focuses on transferring knowledge learned from a set of source examples to another types of samples. Combining these two approaches constitutes deep transfer learning and is a promising solution to investigate and understand the association of high-resolution components of these new cancer data with the corresponding clinical outcomes. Here we propose the use of deep transfer learning to transfer patient outcome information learned from large patient transcriptomics cohorts to the cells, cell types, spatial regions, and image features, which can then be further prioritized by their assigned risks and be evaluated as potential targets in the aggressive cancers. Specifically, we will develop deep transfer learning frameworks DEGAS for cell type prioritization and test on glioblastoma and multiple myeloma single cell data to validate this approach. Then it will be applied on single cell data of more aggressive cancer types such as triple negative breast cancer, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, non-small-cell lung cancer, and gastric cancer to prioritize high risk cells and cell types. Then, it will be further modified for use with spatial transcriptomic (ST) data to prioritize high risk spatial regions of breast cancer and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma tumors. Since ST data can act as a bridge between single cell to patient-level transcriptomics, and histology images. We will further leverage our framework to identify high risk image features by linking histology image features to patient risk via ST data. Finally, our framework will be built into R and Python packages available through GitHub and Bioconductor for use by the broader cancer research community.",2022-07-01T12:07:00Z,2024-06-30T12:06:00Z,RFA-CA-21-013,nofo_RFA-CA-21-013,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,INDIANAPOLIS,IN,UNITED STATES,itcr
R21CA264343,Deep learning in cervical cancer radiogenomics,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The overall goal of this proposal is to optimize the use of radiomic and genomic data to develop biomarkers which make clinical predictions that change cancer patient management. While the need for such predictive biomarkers is evident across cancer types, we focus our proposal on the particularly prevalent and damaging condition of recurrent, locally-advanced cervical cancer (LACC). Cervical cancer remains the third most common cancer diagnosis of women, and treatment failure for locally-advanced disease is 30-50% following chemoradiation therapy. There is a pressing need to identify patients at risk for treatment failure to allow for personalized treatment including modified chemoradiation regimens, early escalation of therapy, and clinical trial enrollment. To develop radiogenomic biomarkers for LACC recurrence, this proposal addresses three outstanding methodological needs: limited availability of gene expression data for cancer subtypes, noisy and redundant imaging feature data, and lack of disease-informed, interpretable -omics integration, each addressed in its own specific aim. Aim 1 will use generative adversarial networks (GAN) to augment the small gene expression datasets for all high-risk HPV subtypes. Aim 2 will optimize imaging feature selection using a deep convolutional autoencoder (CAE). Aim 3 will integrate radiogenomic features through a structural equation modeling (SEM) approach incorporating HPV-specific oncogenic mechanisms as latent variables. Together, we expect fulfillment of these aims will create an optimized recurrence biomarker which will out- perform other prediction modalities as well as standard-of-care follow-up imaging. Beyond the specific application to HPV-driven malignancies, our proposal will generate novel tools and methods to integrate any high-dimensional radiogenomic data with hypothesis-driven research findings to improve cancer prediction.",2022-06-13T12:06:00Z,2024-05-31T12:05:00Z,RFA-CA-21-013,nofo_RFA-CA-21-013,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,SAINT LOUIS,MO,UNITED STATES,itcr
R21CA264353,scDECO: A novel statistical framework to identify differential co-expression gene combinations systematically using single-cell RNA sequencing data,"Project Summary Recent single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) studies have revealed complex tumor ecosystems characterized by intricate interactions between heterogeneous cell types and diverse transcriptional programs. Differential co-expression (DC) analysis is emerging as a crucial complement to the standard differential expression analysis (DE) for gene profiling data. DC analysis can detect correlation changes between pairs of genes across different modulating conditions. However, most DC analysis approaches are originally designed for use on either microarray or bulk RNAseq data. There is an urgent need to develop advanced DC analytical techniques that are tailored to the characteristics of single-cell data, study design and biological objectives. In Aim 1, we will develop a novel, flexible Bayesian model-based framework named scDECO to improve the accuracy of identifying DC gene combinations using scRNAseq data. Using data generated from various scRNAseq experiment protocols, we will evaluate the proposed scDECO algorithm and perform benchmarking analyses to compare our proposed approaches to current approaches. These analyses will provide a better understanding of the advantages and limitations of these methods. In Aim2, we will implement the scDECO algorithm using scRNAseq datasets from melanoma and prostate circulating tumor cells. By identifying sets of clinically relevant DC gene pairs using single-cell data, the findings can promote understanding of the transcriptional co-regulatory processes in cancer stem-like cells and other cells in the tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, the proposed framework has the potential to improve clinical disease severity prediction by incorporating gene co-expression information into risk score calculation. The predictive performance of the proposed algorithm will be further evaluated using both scRNAseq and bulk RNAseq data. Finally, in Aim3, freely available R/Bioconductor software packages will be distributed. The R/Bioconductor environments are both very commonly used by biomedical researchers. Ultimately, this proposed framework will accelerate studies seeking to understand the differential co-regulatory transcriptional activities in tumors.",2021-09-01T12:09:00Z,2024-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-20-007,nofo_RFA-CA-20-007,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,COLUMBIA,SC,UNITED STATES,itcr
R21CA264361,Inferring cell state tumor microenvironment maps by integrating single-cell and spatial transcriptomics,"SUMMARY Single-cell RNA-Sequencing (scRNA-Seq) has proved to be a transformative technology for cancer biology, enabling the unbiased transcriptomic profiling of individual tumor cells and revealing a striking amount of transcriptional heterogeneity in malignant cells. Many reports in recent years have identified a range of cancer cell states in diverse cancer types suggesting that these are stable and functional tumor units, with roles in tumor maintenance and progression. However, a major shortcoming of scRNA-Seq analysis is the loss of spatial information which follows from the dissociation of the tumor prior to sequencing. Lacking knowledge of the general location of each cell within the tissue, as well as its local neighborhood, scRNA-Seq cannot alone inform us about the complex set of relationships among cancer cell states, together with their interactions with the elements of the tumor microenvironment. Spatial transcriptomics is a disruptive new technology that for the first time is able to measure whole transcriptomes in a robust fashion throughout a tissue. While spatial transcriptomics maps the expression of all genes simultaneously – enabling systematic and unbiased transcriptome analysis – it is not itself a single-cell technology and thus also cannot alone inform us on the patterning of cancer cell states together with states of the tumor microenvironment. Sensitive and robust algorithms are thus required to harness the full power implicit in an integration of these technologies. Here we propose to develop a new computational method called SNAP (Single-cell Neighborhood Map) which uses matched scRNA-Seq and spatial transcriptomics data from the same tumor to infer the spatial location of each scRNA-Seq-identified cell by reference to the spatial transcriptomics data, and produces a neighborhood transcriptome for each scRNA-Seq cell. To analyze these novel neighborhood transcriptomes we propose an approach to cluster cells with common patterns of neighbors, thereby identifying sets of colocalizing cell states. SNAP promises to exploit the complementary aspects of single-cell and spatial transcriptomics to link co- localizing cancer cell states and states of the tumor microenvironment. The methodology presented here includes several novel algorithms, all of which will be made freely available to the community, where we expect them to be broadly applicable across cancer biology.",2021-09-01T12:09:00Z,2024-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-20-007,nofo_RFA-CA-20-007,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,NEW YORK,NY,UNITED STATES,itcr
R21CA264381,Computational approaches to unravel immune receptor sequencing for cancer immunotherapy,"PROJECT SUMMARY The adaptive immune system is responsible for the specific recognition and elimination of antigens originating from infection and disease. It recognizes antigens via an immense array of antigen-binding antibodies (B-cell receptors, BCRs) and T-cell receptors (TCRs), the immune repertoire. Because of the enormous breadth of epitopes recognized by immune repertoires, immune repertoires are extremely diverse and dynamic. Advances in immune receptor sequencing (Rep-seq), such as next generation sequencing, have driven the quantitative and molecular-level profiling of immune repertoires, thereby revealing the high-dimensional complexity of the immune receptor sequence landscape. However, current analysis tools lack the ability to track and examine the dynamic nature of the repertoire across serial time points or to identify the common features across repertoires thoroughly and efficiently. We will develop computationally efficient methods with advanced machine learning techniques, including network analysis, feature selection and classification, and advanced statistical approaches, to interrogate and measure immune repertoire architecture longitudinally, to identify common features across repertoires and to assess their clinical relevance. Network analysis is a powerful approach that can identify TCRs sharing antigen specificity and highly mutable BCR, which can help to develop or improve existing immunotherapeutics and immunodiagnostics. However, network construction is computationally expensive, therefore, we will develop an adaptive subsampling strategy to relieve computation burden. We will implement the proposed methods on two studies to better illustrate the diversity and richness of the data to demonstrate the flexibility and power of the proposed tools. Furthermore, we will develop bioinformatics software by incorporating the proposed methods and techniques to tackle the complexity of the Rep-seq data in a translational fashion and provide a comprehensive platform with user-friendly visualization tools.",2021-09-17T12:09:00Z,2024-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-20-007,nofo_RFA-CA-20-007,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",SAN FRANCISCO,CA,UNITED STATES,itcr
R21CA264383,Predicting transcriptional signatures and tumor subtypes from circulating tumor DNA,"Project Summary/Abstract Tumor phenotype changes, such as trans-differentiation in lethal prostate cancers and hormone receptor conversions in breast cancer, are increasingly frequent observations as resistance mechanisms to targeted therapies. Therefore, characterizing the transcriptional regulation that drives treatment-induced tumor phenotype changes during therapy in “real-time” has critical implications for studying mechanisms of resistance to therapies and informing clinical treatment decisions. Surveillance of molecular changes in tumors is especially challenging because the location and number of metastatic sites make it intractable to perform repeated biopsies. As a result, it is difficult to characterize tumor evolution and cellular plasticity during therapy, exemplifying a major limitation of current treatment strategies and precision medicine for patients with metastatic cancer. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) released from tumor cells into the blood is a non-invasive “liquid biopsy” solution for addressing challenges in tissue accessibility. Current research and clinical efforts have focused on detecting genomic alterations in ctDNA. However, studying the tumor phenotype from ctDNA remains challenging and is still a nascent area of research. The objective of this proposal is to develop an innovative computational method to profile and integrate genomic alterations, chromatin accessibility, and transcriptional regulation directly from standard ctDNA sequencing data. Recent advances and our preliminary studies now demonstrate the intriguing possibility to profile these “multi- omic” patterns solely from computational analysis of standard ctDNA whole genome sequencing data. However, there is still a lack of tools to predict transcriptional profiles from ctDNA. In Aim 1, we will develop a generalized framework to predict transcriptional regulation from ctDNA. We will optimize ctDNA data normalization and develop an unsupervised probabilistic generative model for predicting chromatin accessibility and transcriptional regulation in ctDNA. To evaluate the method, we will perform benchmarking using plasma ctDNA from patient- derived xenograft models. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that the multi-omic signatures profiled from ctDNA will provide a non-invasive approach to classify tumor subtypes and to survey molecular phenotype changes during therapy. We will develop classifiers for predicting tumor subtypes and phenotype changes in adult and pediatric cancers. To test the utility for characterizing multi-omic signature and predicting treatment-induced phenotype changes, we will analyze serial ctDNA samples from patients receiving targeted therapies. The method will be implemented as an open-source R package, and a workflow that can be deployed on local and cloud environments, facilitating its adoption in the cancer research community. This proposal addresses the urgent unmet clinical need for better analytical approaches to study cancer treatment resistance in “real-time” and to advance cancer precision medicine.",2021-09-10T12:09:00Z,2023-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-20-007,nofo_RFA-CA-20-007,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER CENTER,Seattle,WA,UNITED STATES,itcr
R21CA269415,Engineering model-based systems to monitor and steer subclonal dynamics,"ABSTRACT Primary tumors as well as cancer cell lines have been shown to exhibit extensive genetic and transcriptional heterogeneity, with multiple subclones co-existing in the same cancer population.1 Even after decades of in-vitro growth, established cell cultures continue to evolve.2 The heterogeneity of cancer cell lines over space and time crystallizes into three unmet needs: i) cell culture protocols that offer a high temporal resolution on in-vitro growth dynamics; ii) close monitoring of the temporal separation between genotypic and phenotypic measurements and iii) reconciling the cost-prohibitive nature of repeated high-throughput multi-omic measurements with ceaseless changes in subclonal composition. To fill these needs, we propose to engineer how in-vitro and in-silica experiments interact into a software solution called CLONEID. An SOL database in the backend, a Java core and an R user interface will come together to form two modules: One will record the pedigree of lineages grown in a lab and use computer vision to monitor phenotypic changes, such as variable growth rates. The second module will link subclonal multi-omics profiles from different high throughput assays to each other and to the phenotypes from the first module. In aim 1 we will develop the first module and use it to demonstrate feasibility of monitoring phenotypic transitions of cell lines with CLONE ID at high temporal resolution, without any specialized equipment. Aim 2 will use this data in conjunction with existing single cell sequencing of the same cell lines to develop and test the second module and use it to identify subclone-specific biomarkers of growth. Together these aims will pave the way to more complex mathematical models of carcinogenesis, that do not have to rely on the simplifying assumption that individual driver mutations have equal fitness effects and that individual subclones have a fixed growth rate. In the future, the framework developed here will serve as foundation to deploy computer vision for early detection of morphological changes, including adaptation from in-vivo to in-vitro growth and mycoplasma contamination.",2023-05-01T12:05:00Z,2025-04-30T12:04:00Z,RFA-CA-22-021,nofo_RFA-CA-22-021,H.

R21CA269425,Identifying Recurrent Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma in Electronic Health Data,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Electronic health records (EHRs) represent a rich resource for the efficient study of outcomes for patients diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). However, cancer recurrence is not required to be reported to cancer registries, and as a result, innovative algorithms based in EHR data are needed to validly identify this important patient outcome for population-based studies. This proposal aims to construct algorithms first using a rule-based approach informed by expert knowledge, and second using a data-driven machine learning approach to detect recurrence of two common histologic subtypes of NHL: the aggressive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and the more indolent follicular lymphoma (FL). Approximately 20-25% of DLBCL and 25- 35% of FL survivors will experience disease recurrence, yet modifiable risk factors for recurrence are largely unknown. Subtype-specific algorithms will be developed using longitudinally collected EHR data from two large healthcare systems serving demographically diverse populations, and who share a history of conducting collaborative cancer research. The long-term goal for this work is to apply the validated algorithms to additional healthcare systems with shared data infrastructure to establish a multi-site study of patients diagnosed with NHL to identify determinants of lymphoma outcomes and advance this understudied field of research. The proposed project will include 1,128 DLBCL and 519 FL cases aged 18 years and older at diagnosis (2000- 2018) with follow-up through 2021 from Henry Ford Health System (Detroit, MI) and the Meyers Primary Care Institute/Reliant Medical Group (Worcester, MA). Essential post-diagnosis data including detailed treatment history, tumor characteristics, and healthcare utilization will be compiled for all study participants, along with text-based clinical notes and reports. The proposed research aims to: 1) develop and evaluate rule-based algorithms integrating data from health claims, EHRs, and tumor registries, including specific treatment data and results from relevant procedures; and 2) adopt a machine learning approach integrated with natural language processing to improve algorithm performance. We will validate the algorithms for each NHL subtype against a gold-standard recurrence registry at HFHS and targeted EHR review at both study sites. The positive predictive value of each algorithm will be calculated. By successfully identifying patients with recurrent NHL in real-world electronic health data, we will take the first step towards identifying factors that increase a patient’s risk of recurrence. This cohort of patients with NHL will benefit from up to 21 years of clinical follow-up and detailed treatment data collected from standardized electronic data resources. Accurately capturing disease recurrence in patients with NHL through EHR data will facilitate the application of these algorithms to additional healthcare systems with shared data infrastructure, and allow for the efficient conduct of large-scale, population-based studies of critical, yet understudied, patient outcomes.",2022-09-14T12:09:00Z,2025-03-31T12:03:00Z,RFA-CA-21-013,nofo_RFA-CA-21-013,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,WORCESTER,MA,UNITED STATES,itcr
R21CA274487,Geles: A Novel Imaging Informatics System for Generalizable Lesion Identification in Neuroendocrine Tumors,"PROJECT SUMMARY Gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs) are difficult to detect tumors which commonly present at advanced stages, with the liver as the most common site of metastases. 68Ga and 64Cu DOTATATE positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET/CT) are the most sensitive methods to identify somatostatin receptor subtype 2 positive GEP-NETs, and targeted peptide radionuclide receptor therapy with 177Lu DOTATATE is the most effective systemic therapy for many patients. Despite the clear advantage in progression-free survival compared to prior standard of care, the vast majority of patients (99%) do not have complete response and require additional therapies. Further development of treatments requires an accurate assessment of the response to therapy. However, there is currently an unmet medical need for automated, standardized quantification of 68Ga DOTATATE positive disease burden, which could have a great impact on novel therapeutic drug regimen development. Deep learning-based approaches have recently been applied to automated lesion detection and quantification, and have achieved state-of-the-art performance. These methods, however, do not consider dataset/domain shifts between training and testing data. In dataset/domain shifts, data used to build and train models might have a significantly different distribution from that used for model testing. Therefore, models without considering domain shifts would not generalize well to unseen data, leading to poor lesion detection performance. In this proposed research, we will develop a novel deep learning-based imaging informatics system, termed Geles, for automated, Generalizable lesion detection for livers in GEP-NET PET/CT imaging. This system will use list-mode data acquisition to produce a large, diverse annotated training dataset, followed by novel adversarial learning to enhance model generalizability. The proposed Geles system will consist of two modules, domain generalization and domain adaptation. Aim 1 will develop an adversarial domain generalization module that is generalizable to unseen domains or resources. This module will build a deep neural network with domain-adversarial learning and extract domain-invariant feature representations for individual lesion identification, so that the system can generalize to unseen domain data, such as PET images from different institutions, devices, imaging protocols, and other variations. Aim 2 will develop a target-oriented domain adaptation module that is automatically adaptable to new specific datasets of interest (i.e., target datasets). Given a small set of unannotated images from a certain target dataset, this module will conduct low-resource unsupervised domain adaptation to further boost the lesion detection performance. Specifically, it will build a novel, augmented generative adversarial network for image-to-image translation in a low-resource setting, so that Geles can take advantage of limited, unannotated specific target data and conduct target-oriented, enhanced lesion detection.",2023-09-19T12:09:00Z,2025-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-22-021,nofo_RFA-CA-22-021,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,Aurora,CO,UNITED STATES,itcr
R21CA274500,Individualized estimates of treatment benefit from hormone therapy for men with prostate cancer,"Abstract National treatment guidelines, including those from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), for men with localized prostate cancer are based on prostate cancer specific mortality (PCSM) risk and life expectancy which is driven by other cause (non-cancer) mortality (OCM). While OCM is the dominant risk for many prostate cancer patients, it has received limited attention in the literature. We developed and validated a clinically relevant model for OCM and life expectancy using prospective data from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial (PLCO) trial. OCM varied substantially based on patient demographics and comorbidities and found that social security life expectancy estimations based on age alone generated substantially biased estimates. Our team also developed and validated a clinical prognostic model for PCSM published in JAMA Oncology in 2020 (STAR-CAP). While the importance of competing risks in prostate cancer is widely recognized, there are no models to date which provide PCSM risk estimates individualized by OCM risk. Many of the common and important treatment decisions for men with localized PC include whether to treat with hormone therapy (ADT) and for how long. Guidelines recommend ADT for many men who are treated without it due to morbidity and questions as to actual treatment benefit for individual patients. Phase III trials have provided overall estimates of the benefit of ADT in terms of reduction in PCSM over large groups of patients (e.g. intermediate risk). To date however, there are no tools which provide treatment benefit estimates for individual patients based on PCSM and OCM risk. We propose to address these shortcomings through two aims. In Aim 1 we will integrate our model for OCM risk with models for distant metastases (DM) and PCSM to provide estimates of the absolute risk of DM and PCSM that are personalized using both PCSM and OCM risk factors. We hypothesize that the integrated model estimates will differ from clinical ad hoc estimates and significantly improve upon current estimates of PCSM that do not consider OCM risk. In Aim 2 we will develop a web app which provides individualized estimates of ADT treatment effect in three common clinical scenarios: RT vs RT + short term ADT in intermediate risk, RT + short term ADT vs RT + long term ADT in high risk and RT vs RT + ADT in the salvage setting. To do this we will combine the integrated multistate model from Aim 1 with published hazard ratios for outcomes of PCSM and DM. Our group is uniquely positioned to carry out this work as we have already developed the component models, have access to the patient level data for additional analyses and have a track record of successful development of web apps to aid in clinical decision making. If successful, the tools developed in this application will provide clinicians and patients the key information they need to make informed treatment decisions.",2023-09-20T12:09:00Z,2025-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-22-021,nofo_RFA-CA-22-021,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,ANN ARBOR,MI,UNITED STATES,itcr
R21CA274545,Oncology Knowledge Rapid Alerts: Integrating biomarker-driven clinical decision support for therapy selection at point-of-care,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Precision cancer medicine uses patient molecular test results to guide cancer therapy selection. An increasing number of cancer therapies are now targeted to specific molecular alterations, and tumor molecular testing is now standard of care. A significant obstacle in advancing precision cancer therapy is the rapid pace of change in this field—making it challenging for oncologists to stay up to date. The long-term goal of this project is to integrate clinical decision support (CDS) for precision cancer therapy selection directly into the electronic health record (EHR). Ultimately, we will create an integrated CDS solution within the EHR that includes best practice alerts to oncologists and integration of CDS into the molecular testing result report. The objective of this R21 is to develop a CDS algorithm to match molecular test results to targeted therapy assertions from a widely used precision oncology knowledgebase, deliver an open-source web service application programming interface (API) that can support vendor-agnostic integration with any EHR that uses the new genomic data standards, and provide proof-of-concept, point-of-care CDS in our local EHR environment. We will accomplish this through the following specific aims: Aim 1. Develop an open-source algorithm and API for computing and storing biomarker-driven CDS from the My Cancer Genome (MCG) knowledgebase. We will develop an algorithm that will compute targeted therapy options for a patient’s tumor histology and molecular profile from the data stored in the MCG knowledgebase. We will build a web service API that receives molecular testing data, calls the MCG knowledgebase, runs the CDS algorithm, and outputs the computed CDS in a format that can be stored for rapid retrieval and that is compatible with EHRs using the new genomic data standards. Aim 2. Develop methods for integration of biomarker-driven CDS into the EHR as human-readable statements. In this aim, we will build API functions to receive communications from the EHR when an oncologist views tumor test results, retrieve cached CDS, and send CDS to the EHR. Using non-small cell lung cancer as a proof-of-concept, our initial use cases will provide integration of CDS with the molecular results report and best practice alerts to oncologists. This project will provide tools to match patient molecular test results to appropriate targeted therapies. At the conclusion of this project, an oncologist will be able to view CDS when they access patient molecular results in the EHR. This point-of-care CDS will facilitate delivery of the right information to the right person at the right time to maximize impact on clinical care.",2022-09-19T12:09:00Z,2024-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-21-013,nofo_RFA-CA-21-013,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,NASHVILLE,TN,UNITED STATES,itcr
R21CA274620,Predicting actionable cancer vulnerabilities enabled by mutant-directed protein-protein interactions,"Cancer is the second leading cause of death worldwide, causing more than 10 million deaths every year. In response, tremendous efforts have been made over the past decades to understand the molecular mechanisms of tumorigenesis and inform new therapeutic strategies in cancer. Unraveling the cancer genome and proteome landscapes revealed that genomic alterations, such as missense mutations, promote tumorigenesis by rewiring networks of protein-protein interactions (PPI). However, the understanding of how mutant-directed neomorph PPIs (neoPPI) lead to the acquisition of cancer hallmarks and the discovery of neoPPI-enabled cancer vulnerabilities remain major challenges. We propose to address this challenge by developing novel computational methods termed Averon Notebook to discover actionable vulnerabilities enabled by rewired oncogenic networks. To achieve this goal, we will leverage our expertise in both cancer bioinformatics and experimental cancer biology demonstrated in numerous publications and long-time participation in the Cancer Target Discovery and Development (CTD^2) Network of the National Cancer Institute. Over the past decade, we have established comprehensive bioinformatics workflows and novel analytical tools to collect, process, integrate, and analyze different types of cancer-related data. To integrate cancer genomics data with protein- protein interaction networks and clinical compounds, we have developed the OncoPPi Portal, which has already enabled the discovery of multiple new molecular mechanisms of tumorigenesis. In this project, we will capitalize on our expertise in computational science and cancer biology to develop i) a new algorithm to determine the neoPPI-regulated biological programs, and ii) methods to determine actionable vulnerabilities in neoPPI- regulated pathways. Ultimately, this project will provide the first computational environment specially designed to rapidly identify actionable targets and pathways enabled by mutant-directed protein-protein interactions to inform target discovery in cancer.",2022-09-01T12:09:00Z,2024-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-21-013,nofo_RFA-CA-21-013,EMORY UNIVERSITY,ATLANTA,GA,UNITED STATES,itcr
R21CA274622,Artificial intelligence enhanced cancer cell classification based organelle morphology and topology,"ABSTRACT Breast cancer is a highly heterogenous disease, both phenotypically and genetically. The quantity and subcellular location of cancer protein biomarkers are used to classify breast cancer types. Transcriptomics, multiplexed imaging, or mass cytometry have been used to classify breast tumor cell heterogeneity with varying success. Although genomics and proteomics have been successful in the identification of tumor cell populations involved in metastatic progression, the ability to determine whether patient tumors contain metastatic subpopulations is still lacking. Recently, organelle morphology and function has been used as a direct readout of the functional phenotypic state of an individual cancer cell. We propose to use the spatial context of organelles, specifically their subcellular location and inter-organelle relationships (topology), to classify novel and distinct metastatic cancer cell subpopulations. We developed an Organelle Topology-based Cell Classification Pipeline (OTCCP) to quantify, for the first time, the topological features of subcellular organelles, defined as the distance between each organelle object and all its neighbors within a cell. Under RFA-CA-21-013 (Development of Innovative Informatics Methods and Algorithms for Cancer Research and Management), we will adapt or develop Machine learning and Deep Learning methodologies to accelerate and automate OTCCP-based organelle- based topology cancer cell classification to identify subpopulations of metastatic cells within heterogeneous primary tumors with potential diagnostic and prognostic value. This approach will also have major impact as a discovery tool to advance our understanding of cancer cell biology on a subcellular level.",2022-09-01T12:09:00Z,2024-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-21-013,nofo_RFA-CA-21-013,ALBANY MEDICAL COLLEGE,ALBANY,NY,UNITED STATES,itcr
R21CA279068,GPU-based SPECT Reconstruction Using Reverse Monte Carlo Simulations,"Project Summary/Abstract Interest in applications of radiopharmaceutical conjugates has notably increased in the last few years for the treatment of a variety of cancers. These conjugates are composed of chelators to target cancer cells and radionuclides to employ the cytotoxicity of ionizing radiation. Radiation dosimetry is required to determine the dosages, efficacy, and safety of these treatments, and 3D quantitative imaging of the biodistribution of activity represents the best tool to perform dosimetry. For most radionuclides employed (non-positron-emitters), SPECT imaging is needed for patient-specific dosimetry. However, multiple physical factors affect SPECT image quality, such as attenuation, scattering, or the response collimator-detector system in SPECT scans. To account for them, Monte Carlo techniques can be used due to their remarkable accuracy in representing physical processes relevant to the transport of ionizing radiation. In particular, 3D SPECT reconstruction from the acquired bidimensional projections may be obtained by transporting backward the photons detected in the gamma camera projections, although many photons to be reversely transported require specially optimized architecture and simulations. This project will develop a new reverse Monte Carlo software for SPECT reconstruction, built from scratch in the GPU to speed up simulations. First, only the relevant reverse physical processes will be selected and modeled using inverse processes of the well-characterized TOPAS Monte Carlo code for radiation transport. Then, specific properties of collimator-detector systems will be integrated into our code to determine the angular distributions for the photons detected. Finally, these developments will be integrated into a GPU-based platform and shared with the Informatics Technology for Cancer Research program at NCI for further results of specific commercial SPECT scans from the research community.",2023-09-08T12:09:00Z,2025-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-22-021,nofo_RFA-CA-22-021,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,BOSTON,MA,UNITED STATES,itcr
R21CA279630,Spatio-temporal mechanistic modeling of whole-cell tumor metabolism,"Abstract Understanding the metabolic characteristics of tumors and their environments is crucial for elucidating the mechanisms of cancer development and for developing therapeutic strategies. Despite the increasing availability of 3D gene expression and other high-throughput data, a major unresolved challenge is how to translate complex datasets and knowledge of human metabolism and cellular biophysics into forecasts of tumor growth dynamics, spatial structure and severity, and possible therapeutic strategies. Our highly interdisciplinary project will leverage existing computational approaches to address this challenge, establishing a new avenue for performing spatio-temporal modeling and simulations of whole-cell cancer metabolism in its microenvironment. Previous work has explored 3D mathematical models of cancer growth based on simplified descriptions of cell populations, e.g. through differential equations. In parallel, based on the approach of flux balance analysis, detailed tumor metabolism models have been used to predict all steady state fluxes in the cell, and the effects of perturbations of target genes. While in principle possible, models combining 3D spatio-temporal dynamics with detailed genome-scale metabolism, have not been developed yet. Here, we propose to repurpose our free and open- access software platform for computation of microbial ecosystems in time and space (COMETS) towards the study of tumor growth dynamics. Specifically: Aim 1: We will generate omics-data-constrained genome scale models of specific cancer cell lines, and import them into COMETS. We will then simulate overall tumor growth dynamics, and test our capacity to accurately predict key metabolic phenotypes, such as growth curves, glucose and amino acid uptake, and lactate secretion. Aim 2: We will build upon our capacity to accurately simulate with COMETS fine details of multicellular dynamics in 2D to generate and test predictions of tumor growth on a surface. We will vary tumor geometry and microenvironment composition, and experimentally test predictions using a cancer on-chip approach. Aim 3: Using the advanced capabilities of COMETS, we will explore tumor heterogeneity, and extend our detailed biophysical model for biomass propagation to 3D realistic microenvironments (with gradients and vascularization), in search for metabolic characteristics associated with morphological features of 3D tumors. We expect that results generated through this project will pave the way for predictive modeling of cancer growth and metabolism, applicable to the study of in vivo tumors. Gradual application of new COMETS capabilities will allow us to extend initial models to more complex scenarios and configurations, including interactions between different cell types, detailed modeling of specific tumor geometries based on imaging data, predictions of metastasis and metabolic adaptation in tissues other than the tissue of origin, simulations of interactions with the microbiome, and the implementation of in silico testing of thousands of combinatorial therapeutic strategies.",2023-05-01T12:05:00Z,2025-04-30T12:04:00Z,RFA-CA-22-021,nofo_RFA-CA-22-021,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),BOSTON,MA,UNITED STATES,itcr
R21CA284221,Defining therapeutic strategies for boosting T-cell infiltration into cold tumors with spatial proteomics and machine learning,"Project Summary Immunotherapies such as immune checkpoint inhibitors and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR-T) cell therapy have been highly successful in reversing cancer progression in a subset of patients. However, immunotherapies fail in patients with “cold tumors,” where T-cell infiltration and function are suppressed by inhibitory signaling environments generated by cancer and stromal cells. Poor CD8+ T-cell infiltration due to suppressive signaling environments is a primary obstacle to effective immunotherapy in many solid tumors including breast, liver, prostate, and colon cancer. Recent advances in high-resolution molecular imaging technologies, known as spatial proteomic methods, now allow micron-resolution profiling of signaling environments in cold and hot human tumors across up to 50 molecular channels providing a new data source for identifying signaling cues that promote or suppress T-cell infiltration. There is an urgent unmet need for computational strategies that can analyze large-scale, spatial proteomic data sets collected from human patient data to identify features of the tumor microenvironment that promote cold vs hot tumor phenotypes. Computational methods must be designed to extract concrete and specific therapeutic strategies that can be tested clinically for reprogramming the tumor microenvironment to promote T-cell infiltration and function. In this project, we develop a machine learning framework that uses cutting-edge spatial proteomic data to identify signaling molecules and guidance cues that promote the infiltration and function of T-cells into a tumor microenvironment. Our approach first trains a neural network on spatial proteomic data to predict T-cell infiltration using signaling and guidance cues. We, then, apply “counterfactual reasoning” to the classifier to predict optimal signaling perturbations for increasing CD8 T-cell infiltration into tumors. In preliminary data, we applied our strategy to melanoma and identified a therapeutic strategy that involves manipulation of five chemokine and signaling molecules in melanoma based on spatial proteomic data from 300 patients. In the work to be performed here, we aim to generalize our approach to a broader range of cancer types and larger patient data sets. We will systematically test neural network architectures to identify optimal architectures for different cancer types. Since spatial proteomic training data is currently limited, we will collect new training data from human patients across a broader set of tumors, for which we will profile chemokine and signaling molecules through a collaboration between Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and Caltech. We will generalize our counterfactual reasoning strategy to breast and prostate cancer to identify optimal therapeutic targets and to compare targets for different base tumor types. Broadly, our work will develop a novel machine learning approach for converting large-scale spatial proteomic data into specific molecular hypotheses for increasing T-cell infiltration into cold tumors across a range of solid tumor types.",2023-09-05T12:09:00Z,2025-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-22-021,nofo_RFA-CA-22-021,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,PASADENA,CA,UNITED STATES,itcr
R21CA284233,Deep Learning of Mass Spectrometry Imaging,"PROJECT SUMMARY Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is a rapidly developing technology which gives pathologists many new types of targets (e.g., metabolites and lipids) to assess for translational cancer research. However, the resulting data are even more complex than traditional images because they are highly-dimensional, and large (~100GB per tissue section). Each “pixel” in the resulting data structure contains a 2-dimensional mass spectrum made of both measured ion mass and ion mobility (m/z, 1/K0), and each spectrum typically contains hundreds to thousands of individual ions (metabolites and lipids). Deep-learning methods (machine learning) have been successfully applied to histopathology data by several laboratories including Dr. David Fenyo, Co-Investigator of the current proposal, with such models being able to discriminate between different cancer subtypes and grades for example. However, most machine learning models of image-data are designed around 3-data channels (Red, Green, Blue) for analysis of digital images. Therefore, the n-dimensional data structure of mass spectrometry imaging datasets is not easily amenable to these proven machine learning workflows. We will make MSI data accessible to these approaches by expanding to n-dimension “color-channels”, with each unique metabolite or lipid image serving as an individual data input. For the deep learning component, we will retain the same overall architecture and workflow of the Panoptes tool, published by Fenyo et. al., (Cell Reports, Medicine, 2021) but we will apply an n-dimensional approach and test the data structure on existing data which has parallel H&E stain information annotated by pathologists. These challenges are addressed in Aim1 of the current proposal, while Aim 2 addresses a closely related challenge of detecting image correlations both within and between these data structures and other imaging modalities. Image correlations within such data are more trivial, but these analyses are not well supported by existing academic or vendor software due to the amount of computation needed for hundreds of data dimensions. We further propose and test an approach for converting these multi- dimensional data into centroided single ion images, followed by linearization of the image to enable a simple Pearson correlation metric, thereby making a complete correlation matrix accessible by a scaling factor of n2 to the number of detected ions. Secondly, to deal with spatial correlations between MSI datasets and images from other modalities, or adjacent tissue sections which may be different in size and shape, we propose to implement a spatially aware elastic transform of the centroided image data prior to correlation analysis and machine learning.",2023-09-07T12:09:00Z,2025-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-22-021,nofo_RFA-CA-22-021,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,NEW YORK,NY,UNITED STATES,itcr
R37CA218570,Transforming family dogs into a powerful and accessible model for human cancer,"ABSTRACT There is an unmet need for novel approaches to cancer research, including improved model systems. Pet dogs are among the most promising natural models for translational cancer research. They share our environment and develop cancers with clear clinical, histological, and genomic similarities to human cancer. We propose to use new genomic technology and a direct-to-dog-owner approach to overcome existing limitations of the canine model. To accomplish this, we will use new liquid biopsy technology, which makes it possible to sequence tumor exomes in circulating cell-free DNA from a blood sample, and thus achieve deeper understanding of tumor genomics without invasive biopsies. The power of these minimally invasive sampling technologies is greatest in application to very large sets of clinical samples. Family dogs, whose environments are shared with humans and for which tumor genomics are similar to human cancers, offer an unparalleled model in which to assemble clinical sets of size sufficient both to confirm the relevance of known genetic pathways, and to identify new ones. We propose to combine the power of cell-free DNA sequencing, the enthusiasm of citizen-scientist pet owners, and the clinical experience of veterinarians. We will create a research portal for collection of information on diagnosis, treatment, and outcome for thousands of dogs with cancer, as well as their environment and lifestyle. We will also develop new computational methodologies to identify genomic similarities between canine and human cancers. Comparison of these canine and human mutational profiles will enable matching of canine cancer subtypes with human cancer subtypes based on genetic pathways, facilitating canine trials to advance human clinical studies. We aim to: Aim 1. Develop software to Identify canine models for human cancers using genomic data and comprehensive, histology-blind analysis approach. Aim 2. Develop and optimize cell-free DNA sampling and sequencing methods in dogs, including ultra-low-pass whole genome sequencing and whole exome sequencing. Aim 3.

R37CA234021,Developing and credentialing patient-derived xenograft models to advance therapeutic approaches for chronic myelomonocytic leukemia,"Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia (CMML) is a lethal subtype of leukemia characterized by cytopenias, marrow dysplasia, monocytosis, and a propensity for transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). It is among the most aggressive chronic myeloid malignancies with a median survival of 34 months. Recurrent mutations in CMML have been identified in over 40 genes affecting chromatin state, mRNA splicing, hematopoietic differentiation, and cytokine signaling pathways. Unfortunately, despite the increasing number of genetic alterations identified in CMML, no therapies have been developed with the potential to improve the poor natural history of CMML. Moreover, attempts to model CMML using genetically engineered mouse models have not recapitulated the unique clinical or histological characteristics of the human disease. Patient-derived xenografts (PDX) of acute leukemias have been created using immunocompromised mouse hosts that accurately model the disease and have been used to credential putative therapeutic targets in vivo. However, until now, there has been limited success with development of PDX models for CMML. Recently, our groups have overcome this limitation and generated highly and genetically accurate PDX models of CMML through the use of several novel modified NOD/SCID IL2R null (NSG) mouse strains expressing human cytokines that uniquely drive CMML. Moreover, we have utilized these PDX models to identify novel therapies targeting aberrant cytokine-signaling characteristics and mRNA splicing in specific genetic subsets of CMML. In this proposal we aim to further define the fidelity of these models to the human condition and test several novel preclinical therapeutic approaches with immediate translatability to CMML patients as follows: In Aim 1 we will rigorously explore the fidelity of our PDX models compared to their respective patients by determining if PDX models recapitulate the entire clinical, transcriptional, and proteomic spectrum of CMML ; Aim 2 will determine whether CMML PDX models can recapitulate patient-specific responses to JAK2 inhibitors using samples from both our completed phase I/II clinical trial of the JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib in CMML and a prospective phase 2 ruxolitinib CMML clinical study; Aim 3 will determine the efficacy and mechanism of action of spliceosomal modulatory compounds in CMML PDXs based on spliceosomal gene mutation status. The significance of these studies is that they will create genetically and phenotypically accurate models of an aggressive form of cancer that is lacking preclinical models currently. Moreover, the health relatedness is that our studies will identify novel therapies for this condition, which lacks any effective therapies currently.",2019-08-12T12:08:00Z,2024-07-31T12:07:00Z,PAR-17-245,nofo_PAR-17-245,H.

R37CA248289,Expansion of Tumoroid Models for Precise Treatment of the Rectal Cancer Patient,"We propose to develop rectal cancer organoids (tumoroids) as individualized models and to build a large rectal cancer tumoroid repository. Research on rectal cancers is hampered by the paucity of models. Of the few existing in vivo models of rectal cancer, none place the tumors in the rectal lumen, so the models fail to mimic the correct anatomic environment and local invasion. The existing models also have not been observed to metastasize. Another problem is that we lack accurate means to predict whether individual rectal cancer patients will respond to chemotherapy or radiation, both of which are part of the current standard of care. We believe that both the paucity of models and the lack of predictive tools can be addressed by patient-derived tumoroids. Tumoroids can be grown in 3-dimensional culture ex vivo or implanted into mice, so they offer a flexible research platform. In preliminary results, we have derived tumoroid lines from multiple patients' rectal cancers and found them to resemble the corresponding patient tumors. The tumoroids, when implanted in mice endoluminally (i.e. in the rectum), formed locally invasive tumors capable of metastasis. Moreover, we found tumoroids to have clinically relevant responses to chemotherapy and radiation. Thus, drawing from these preliminary data, we hypothesize that rectal cancer tumoroids mirror the traits of their original tumors, can be used to predict patients' response to therapy, and, when implanted endoluminally into mice, can serve as an optimal model of rectal cancer. We plan to develop 100 new tumoroids, which we expect to encompass much of the diversity of human rectal adenocarcinoma. The tumoroids will be analyzed in ex vivo culture and in two mouse models: the endoluminal implantation model and a conventional flank injection model. In these settings, we will test whether the tumoroid accurately reflects its tumor of origin in terms of mutations, histology, and gene expression. We will determine whether response of the tumoroids to patient-specific chemotherapy and radiation can predict the corresponding patient's response. Of particular interest is whether individual human rectal cancers are more accurately modeled by endoluminal implantation than by flank injection. Finally, to integrate our findings into a comprehensive platform for broad use, we will develop a rectal cancer tumoroid biorepository seamlessly integrated with online pathologic, genomic, and model-specific information. The online platform will be built within our institution's cancer genomics portal, then integrated into the NCIP Hub. We have assembled a collaborative team with expertise in colorectal surgical oncology, radiation oncology, and pathology; organoids; mouse models; biostatistics; and bioinformatics. We anticipate that the proposed research will credential tumoroids as accurate models for rectal cancer research and for predicting patient responses to therapy. The large tumoroid biorepository is likely to stimulate research on new treatments for rectal cancer. The ultimate result will be new treatment options and better treatment selection for patients affected by this deadly disease.",2020-03-01T12:03:00Z,2025-02-28T12:02:00Z,PAR-17-245,nofo_PAR-17-245,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,NEW YORK,NY,UNITED STATES,omf
R37CA255330,Improving the translational value of head and neck cancer patient-in-mouse models,"Project Abstract: Patient-derived model systems are commonly used to study tumor biology and test novel treatments for head and neck cancer. These models are established using patient tumors sourced from surgical specimens and typically implanted into the subcutaneous tissue of the mouse. There is little data available to support the decisions we make during the initial handling of the tumor samples and, most importantly, how these decisions impact the results of subsequent studies. Our long-term goal is to improve outcomes for head and neck cancer patients using valid, predictive, and well characterized model systems. The overall objective of this application is to improve our use of these mammalian model systems by understanding the impact of choices we make when we establish them. By combining innovative approaches to study cancer evolution with rigorous assessment of tumor biology and therapy response we hope to ultimately improve the relevance of studies using these mammalian models to improve the care of human patients. Our central hypothesis is that the approach used to establish patient-derived xenografts has a critical impact on their relevance as translational models. To achieve our goals, we proposed three aims. In Aim 1, we will determine the role of heterotopic vs. orthotopic implantation on the biology of the tumor, how patient-derived animal models change with increasing passage in animals, and how these factors impact tumor evolution. In Aim 2, we will test the concordance of response between patient derived models and patients by using patient derived xenografts established as part of an ongoing (and separately funded) window-of-opportunity trial and will assess consistency in response to standard treatments over time. In Aim 3, we will use an innovative humanized mouse model developed at Wisconsin to assess the evolutionary interplay between the tumor and immune system, understand whether these novel mice replicate the tumor/immune interface seen in human cancers or in syngeneic HNC models, and investigate how well the response to immunotherapy replicates that seen in patients. In summary, these studies will provide compelling evidence for how to optimize our use of mouse models of human head and neck cancer. Completion of this project will provide robust evidence delineating and refining best practices for the translational use of patient derived xenograft animal models of head and neck cancer.",2021-07-01T12:07:00Z,2026-06-30T12:06:00Z,PAR-20-131,nofo_PAR-20-131,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,MADISON,WI,UNITED STATES,omf
U01AA027681,Immunosuppressive mechanisms responsible for development of non-viral liver cancer and control of its response to immune checkpoint inhibitors,"PROJECT SUMMARY This project will explore adaptive immune mechanisms that control development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a leading cause of cancer-related deaths, and dictate its responsiveness to PD-1:PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors. Our team, including Michael Karin, Ph.D. and Shabnam Shalapour, Ph.D. at UCSD School of Medicine and Hidekazu Tsukamoto, D.V.M., Ph.D. and Anthony El-Khoueiry, M.D. at USC Keck School of Medicine, represents an ideal blend of basic researchers, translational scientists and oncologists who are interested in HCC molecular pathogenesis and treatment, especially in HCC caused by non-alcoholic (NASH) and alcoholic (ASH) steatohepatitis. Although the US incidence of HCC and its associated mortality have nearly tripled in the past generation, insufficient effort has been made toward identification and development of innovative and effective HCC therapies. However, the ideal and timely confluence of basic preclinical research and applied clinical studies carried out by our team members has the potential to critically transform HCC treatment forever. Together we found that chronic liver inflammation results in suppression of HCC-protective immunosurveillance to support rapid malignant progression. This unique immunopathogenic mechanism renders HCC responsive to drugs that disrupt the PD-1:PD-L1 checkpoint, but even the impressive response seen thus far and the selection of patients who will benefit from this therapeutic approach can be further improved. Such improvements can only be achieved by a deeper understanding of the mechanisms through which PD-1:PD-L1 inhibitors act, the factors that determine their efficacy, and the causes of treatment failure. We will achieve these goals through integrated studies of clinical specimens collected by Dr. El-Khoueiry and sophisticated, faithful and robust mouse models of non-viral HCC developed by Drs. Tsukamoto, Shalapour, and Karin. The immune mechanisms that control NASH- and ASH-driven HCC development in these models are highly similar to those that operate in human patients. Using this integrated approach, we will pursue five specific aims: 1) determine whether serum IgA concentrations correlate with therapeutic response to PD-1 blockade in patients with non-viral HCC; 2) develop reliable mouse models of ASH-driven HCC; 3) compare the immunosuppressive mechanisms that contribute to development of NASH- and ASH-driven HCC and control their response to PD-L1 blockade; 4) determine whether excessive peritumoral fibrosis correlates with diminished response to PD-1 blockade in HCC patients; and 5) determine whether agents that inhibit or attenuate stellate cell activation potentiate the response to PD- 1/PD-L1 blockade in non-viral HCC. The successful completion of these studies will result in substantial improvements to HCC immunotherapy and will establish reliable procedures for identification of patients who are most likely to benefit from PD-1/PD-L1 targeting drugs, advances that will result in significant cost savings which may amount to hundreds of millions of dollars annually.",2018-09-25T12:09:00Z,2024-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-17-045,nofo_RFA-CA-17-045,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",LA JOLLA,CA,UNITED STATES,iotn
U01CA062461,Phase I Studies of Targeted Anti-Cancer Therapies,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Historically, there have been major problems with the paradigm for the treatment of metastatic cancer. These include poor discrimation of drugs between host and cancer tissues, limited knowledge of appropriate targets, and inability to select patients who are likely to respond. Current advances, especially the introduction of targeted agents into the clinical setting, allow these critical issues to be addressed. We propose that the Phase I trial, which is the cornerstone for drug development, should be designed to provide basic knowledge regarding target impact and selection, upon which further trials can be built. In this regard, it is critical to recognize that molecularly targeted compounds may behave in a way that is fundamentally dissimilar to cytotoxic chemotherapy. For instance, targeted agents may be cytostatic, rather than cytotoxic, and only patients who bear a specific protein capable of being modulated by the drug may respond. Thus, rather than utilizing the standard paradigm for Phase I development of chemotherapeutic agents that is based predominantly on determination of maximum tolerated dose (MTD), a more suitable paradigm involving surrogate markers and functional endpoints is crucial. We, therefore, hypothesize that integration of intermediate biologic endpoints, which reflect interaction with or functional impact on the target, will provide key information for determining optimal biologic dose (OBD), as well as the foundation for further study of biomarker identification of responsive patients in subsequent Phase II studies. With such an undertaking, there must be effective cooperation between clinical and laboratory investigators, in addition to experts in the field of molecular imaging, in order to evaluate the ability of targeted drugs to modulate, interact with, or inhibit specific molecular and biochemical targets. Such cooperation is found at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC), where great emphasis is placed on clinical and translational drug development, as evidenced by our tremendous infrastructure! and educational support for clinical trials research. Indeed, MDACC has extensive facilties and extremely experienced faculty and personnel for data management, quality control, regulatory oversight, specimen acquisition, patient care, and translational studies to identify pharmacodynamic and molecular biomarkers. The significance of our proposed research is that it should advance the development of new cancer therapeutics by providing the groundwork for elucidating how response correlates with target impact, hence laying the foundation for successful personalized cancer treatment.",1994-03-01T12:03:00Z,2015-02-28T12:02:00Z,RFA-CA-02-011;RFA-CA-07-031,nofo_CA-07-031,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,HOUSTON,TX,UNITED STATES,etctn
U01CA062487,Early Clinical Trials of New Anti-Cancer Agents,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Roughly 500 anti-cancer agents will be available for development within the next decade. The Phase I community will face significant challenges making swift and accurate go/no go drug development decisions, due to limited resources for continued clinical development as well as potentially unique profiles that the clinical drug candidates may unfold. It is important to be proactive, anticipating many of the challenges. Maximizing the knowledge base and combining resources to assist in overcoming many of these challenges will be a key component of continued success. Karmanos Cancer Institute (KCI) and University of Maryland Marlene & Stewart Greenebaum Cancer Center (UMGCC) jointly are submitting this application to maximize our strengths as a Phase I Consortium. The combined expertise of both institutions define us as thought leaders in pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), imaging and biostatistics, all necessary components of an efficient and effective phase I program. Both institutions have recognized the greater need for understanding tumor-related targeted drug effects. Drs. LoRusso (KCI Principal Investigator) and Sausville (UMGCC Principal Investigator) have both involved exploration of PD effects of several different classes of agents. Dr. Sausville has developed a PD translational research laboratory at UMGCC to help further develop select PD endpoints for implementation in the clinical trials to be pursued by this consortium. The combined expertise of Drs. LoRusso and Sausville lend collectively at least 40 years experience in preclinical and clinical cancer drug development. Their efforts have led to the development of several commercially available or recently filed agents, including Velcade¿1/2, Ontak¿1/2, capecitabine, zoledronic acid, gefitinib, lapatanib, and ixabepilone, to name a few. Their programs have recognized that patient resources are valuable and limited, and have had significant success developing and evaluating novel trial designs to minimize patients treated at ineffective doses. The locations of both institutions lend themselves to service inner city populations with large women and minority bases, offering the potential for special population studies. Dr. Shields, our collaborator at KCI, has been a thought leader in PET imaging, with several tracers, including FDG and FLT, to his portfolio. This imaging oriented capacity is yet an additional unique feature available to his consortium. With the continued growth and expansion of both programs, we feel this collaboration will be well positioned for the continued development of novel agents offered through the Cancer Treatment Evaluation Program at the National Cancer Institute.",1994-03-04T12:03:00Z,2015-02-28T12:02:00Z,RFA-CA-02-011;RFA-CA-07-031,nofo_CA-07-031,WAYNE STATE UNIVERSITY,DETROIT,MI,UNITED STATES,etctn
U01CA062490,Early Clinical Trials of New Anti-Cancer Agents with Phase I Emphasis,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall objective of this U01 application from the Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center (DF/HCC) is to provide clinical and scientific experience and patient resources to perform Phase I single agent clinical trials* Phase I agent combination clinical trials, limited Phase II clinical trials, and pilot clinical trials of novel anti- cancer agents. These studies will be performed by the DF/HCC Phase I Oncology Group consisting of investigators at the participating Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI), Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH), Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) sites. The DF/HCC Phase I Oncology Group has interacted over the past 15 years (1992-2007) in the conduct of more than 70 Phase I, l-ll pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic clinical trials of investigational new cytotoxic agents, angiogenesis inhibitors, signal transduction/cell cycle inhibitors, differentiating agents and anti-cancer vaccines. Trials performed over the past 4 years (2003-2006, prior funding period) include 10 agents from the NCI Clinical Trials Evaluation Program (CTEP). The DF/HCC Phase I Oncology Group has accrued 219 patients to the 10 CTEP trials during 2003-2006 with an average accrual of 55 patients annually. These trials have been integrated with pharmacokinetic, biochemical, pathological, immunological, molecular and imaging studies that correlate effects of the agents on their targets. The Specific Aims of the DF/HCC application are 1) To perform Phase I, limited Phase II and pilot clinical trials of novel agents in the NCI CTEP IND portfolio that target relevant cancer cell signaling pathways involved in the regulation of cell survival, proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation and angiogenesis; 2) To assess pharmacokinetics of these agents when administered alone or in combination and establish relationships between dose, schedule, exposure and effect; 3) To perform these trials with novel designs where appropriate, including accelerated titration and other advanced design schemes; 4) To establish safe and biologically active treatment schedules for patients with cancer, including those with hepatic and/or renal dysfunction; 5) To obtain mechanistic proof-of-principle data for new agents directed at novel molecular targets; and 6) To evaluate translational endpoints of expression and/or activity of molecular targets and downstream effectors that are regulated by these agents. The importance of this work to the public health is realized by the need for more and better treatment options for the substantial number of cancer patients who, because of disease unresponsive to existing treatments, become candidates for new investigational agents. The research proposed in this U01 agreement is focused on accelerating access of these cancer patients to new treatment strategies.",1994-03-02T12:03:00Z,2014-02-28T12:02:00Z,RFA-CA-02-011;RFA-CA-07-031,nofo_CA-07-031,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,BOSTON,MA,UNITED STATES,etctn

As a result, we have played an active role in the evolution of early drug development and built the foundation to help set the standard for the delivery of individualized cancer care in the future. This application represents the renewal of U01 CA062491. Our Phase I Program continues to emphasize the tradition of excellence in clinical trials established in 1979 with a commitment to: 1) support the diverse array of preclinical research being performed at the UWCCC; 2) provide a stable infrastructure devoted to clinical research; 3) maintain an outstanding group of clinical investigators who perform high quality trials; and 4) promote the interactions between experts throughout the UWCCC and campus. This application details our experience in NCI-sponsored drug development studies over the last grant period and also describes the methods by which we performed these studies.

U01CA062502,Early Clinical Trials of New Anti-Cancer Agents with Phase I Emphasis,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of the Case Comprehensive Cancer Center (Case CCC) Developmental Therapeutics Program Phase I effort is to promote the discovery and evaluation of new, mechanism-based therapeutics for the cancer patient. The program brings together interactive teams of biochemists, molecular biologists, biochemical and clinical pharmacologists, cancer and vascular biologists, virologists, imaging scientists and radiologists, and clinical investigators around specific-mechanism-based targets and imaging technology platforms. New mechanism-based therapies discovered in model systems in a cooperative manner with NCI/CTEP, pharmaceutical partners, and in Cancer Center laboratories are evaluated for feasibility and efficacy in cancer patients by conducting investigator-initiated Phase I and II clinical trials. The Program also pursues development and identification of potential biomarkers to better inform and guide our developmental therapeutics pursuits. There are 3 mechanism-based therapeutic strategies that serve as the primary scientific focus for our Phase I investigative teams: (1) DMA metabolism and repair, (2) cancer angiogenesis, and (3) cell signaling and apoptosis. The Phase I Program benefits from all the scientific and clinical research resources of the Case CCC including the 9 scientific programs and pivotal core facilities (e.g., Translational Research, Clinical Trials, Biostatistics, Cancer Pharmacology, Athymic and Xenograft, Imaging Research, and Flow Cytometry Shared Resources). The Phase I program has provided national leadership to CTEP in the pursuit of mechanism-based early phase drug development, incorporated novel imaging strategies to monitor drug and target effects, developed novel biomarkers to guide drug development and therapeutics, and provided significant contributions to the CTEP Organ Dysfunction Working Group. During this past U01 funding cycle, investigators at the Case CCC contributed 250 patients to CTEP Phase I trials and another 254 patients to CTEP Phase II trials, predominantly with agents that were developed in the Phase I setting (e.g., O6- benzylguanine and rebeccamycin analog) by our group. It is the intent of this application to continue to build on this strong clinical translational research platform and, more importantly, to provide a resource for the cooperative evaluation of scientifically directed Phase I trials of promising anticancer agents available from the NCI drug screening program or referred to NCI from other sources.

U01CA062505,Phase I Molecular and Clincal Pharmacodynamic Trials,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The principal goal of this application by a group of molecular and clinical pharmacologists, molecular biologists, and clinical scientists from the California Cancer Consortium (CCC) comprised of three NCI-designated Cancer Centers is to develop new laboratory-based cancer treatment strategies for application in the early therapeutic trial setting. These Phase I studies will lead not only to the assignment of a recommended, biologically effective Phase II dose, and to an understanding of the spectrum of normal tissue toxicity for specific antineoplastic agents that are directed against novel molecular pathways, but will also provide a mechanistic validation of the effects of the agents on critical tumor cell targets, correlate drug-related alterations of tumor and host biologic markers with clinical outcome, and develop new insights into the therapeutic mechanism of action of Phase I compounds both in the laboratory and the clinic. The investigational methodologies to be used are based on specific areas of scientific and clinical research expertise available at the City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center (COM), the University of Southern California (USC)/Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, and the University of California; Davis Cancer Center (UCD). The Phase I trials to be pursued will be supported by the availability of a large patient resource (in excess of 10,000 new cancer patients per year), a strong record of accrual to Phase I and Phase ll-lll cancer clinical trials (over 1250 total patient accessions in 2006), and a history of productive clinical research interactions among the three institutions (over 2000 patients entered on joint Phase I and II studies). We propose to utilize the combined expertise of COH, USC, and UCD in the areas of molecular pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, pharmacogenomics, signal transduction, cell cycle regulation, non-invasive imaging, and bioinformatics to conduct innovative, laboratory-directed Phase I developmental and pharmacokinetic studies supported by CTEP, NCI that focus on: 1) agents that target genetic or epigenetic abnormalities in cancer cells; 2) agents that target signal transduction pathways, the cell cycle, and host/tumor interactions; 3) agents that are potentially active in hematologic malignancies; 4) agents developed through CCC investigator-initiated RAID projects; and additionally, 5) to examine in special patient populations the clinical pharmacology of targeted anticancer agents whose therapeutic effects may be altered because of abnormal organ function or because of inherited differences in genes controlling drug disposition and activity; and 6) to identify new and informative laboratory correlates of biologic activity and drug resistance and explore novel functional endpoints of tumor response, progression, and clinical benefit for patients entered on the Phase I clinical trials of the CCC.",1994-03-14T12:03:00Z,2015-02-28T12:02:00Z,RFA-CA-02-011;RFA-CA-07-031,nofo_CA-07-031,BECKMAN RESEARCH INSTITUTE/CITY OF HOPE,DUARTE,CA,UNITED STATES,etctn

This application includes four ongoing studies: 1) XK469 as a single dose every 3 weeks, 2) cilengitide by prolonged continuous infusion, 3) PXD101 and 5-azacitidine in leukemia, and 4) a randomized dose-escalation study of sorafenib using 12- hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring as a biomarker. These studies build on the applicants' prior experience with these and related drugs. New studies will be proposed, as based upon the availability of new agents (in response to NCI requests for Letters of Intent). In addition, unsolicited Letters of Intent will be submitted, as determined by the scientific interests of the applicants. Particular areas of expertise and interest include pharmacogenetics and noninvasive biomarkers (such as ambulatory blood pressure monitoring or serum measurements of tyrosine kinase receptors). Most of the studies will evaluate novel therapies in patients with advanced solid tumors. In addition, the applicants anticipate maintaining at least one ongoing study for patients with advanced hematologic malignancies, and at least one study that is open to older children (minimum age 14 years or weight of 45 kg or more). All of the proposed studies will include pharmacokinetic or correlative components.

U01CA069853,Phase I Clinical Trials of Anti-Cancer Agents,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal entitled, ""Phase I Clinical Trials of Anti-Cancer Agents,"" prepared in response to RFA No. CA-02-011, requests support for early stage clinical evaluations, particularly phase I, pharmacological and relevant biological studies, of investigational anti-cancer therapeutics. The greatest advances in the cancer therapy have resulted from the introduction of novel anti-cancer therapeutics and their subsequent optimization (i.e. dosing, scheduling, sequencing, deployment in combination) for clinical practice. The phase I stage represents a crucial step in this developmental process, and the reliability of clinical and supportive pharmacological and biological data may significantly impact on the expedient and optimal development of new therapies. This is especially true for selective rationally-designed, target-based agents. The sheer number investigational candidates is striking relative to available developmental resources, and prioritization of these resources by considering the ultimate impact of the therapeutic represent major developmental challenges that must be overcome. Furthermore, unlike nonspecific cytotoxics, in which anti-cancer activity is often dose-related and, hence, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is generally sought, the preponderance of preclinical data with selective target-based therapeutics suggest that maximal biological effects will occur at doses that are substantially lower than the MTD. Selection of a maximal biological dose would likely result in greater therapeutic indices and more ""breathing room"" for combination development. The preponderance of preclinical data also suggests that the predominant beneficial effects of target-based therapeutics will be tumor growth inhibition, which may not be appreciated in nonrandomized studies. This proposal will describe the San Antonio Drug Development Group's (SADDG) approach to meet these challenges. The specific aims are directed at discerning both traditional phase I study endpoints (e.g. MTD, characterization of toxicity) and relevant biological and pharmacological endpoints (e.g. maximally effective dose.) The latter is particularly important in view of the expectations that many novel anti-cancer agents may not have clear toxicological endpoints, and the prospects for clinical utility may not be known until further evaluations have been completed. Therefore, other specific aims, including the assessment of relevant biological activity at the target level, are of utmost importance to ultimately optimize the therapeutic indices of investigational cancer therapies. The SADDG proposes to perform rigorous and comprehensive toxicological, pharmacological, and biological evaluations in the course of early clinical trials. The results will be synthesized to address therapeutic optimization issues, ascertain proof of principle, and develop assays to discern the relevant effects of the therapy on the target. The development of such assays may be even more crucial for subsequent disease-directed studies to gauge biological targeting and/or tumor growth inhibition in vivo. In addition to the methodology proposed to meet these challenges, the proposal will demonstrate the immense experience, success, and dedication of the SADDG to the comprehensive development of anti-cancer therapeutics, as well as the strong institutional commitment.",1995-07-01T12:07:00Z,2009-02-28T12:02:00Z,RFA-CA-02-011,nofo_CA-02-011,CANCER THERAPY AND RESEARCH CENTER,SAN ANTONIO,TX,UNITED STATES,etctn
U01CA069856,Early Clinical Trials of New Anti-Cancer Agents with Phase 1 Emphasis,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goals of our Phase 1 research program at MSKCC are to: 1) identify promising new therapeutic agents; 2) preclinical study of these agents to better understand the mechanism of action of these agents; 3) extension of preclinical data into rational patient-oriented clinical trials through dose-finding (Phase I) single agent or combination trials; and 4) identification of innovative approaches to Phase 1 study conduct using novel biostatistical, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic approaches. A close collaboration between laboratory and clinical scientists are required to accomplish these goals. We will focus on projects as illustrative of the lab-to-clinic translational research at MSKCC: (1) Hsp90 is an abundant cellular chaperone that is required for refolding of unfolded proteins and we have demonstrated that inhibition of Hsp90 induces the rapid degradation of HER2 and loss of its expression on the membrane. We took advantage of this unique property of Hsp90 inhibitors and developed a novel non-invasive method for imaging loss of HER2 expression in the tumors. This molecular imaging approach will provide a platform for in vivo testing of HspQO inhibitors in patients; (2) Cytotoxic chemotherapy continues to be the mainstay of treatment for many cancers. Since most conventional anti-cancer agents impart damage to the genome and therefore also activate cell cycle checkpoints, pharmacological disruption of collateral checkpoint pathways might create 'synthetic lethality' selectively in tumors and represent a significant therapeutic opportunity; the basic understanding of the targets and sequence of treatment is necessary for our clinical study design; (3) Epidermal growth factor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR TKIS) such as gefitinib and erlotinib have changed how we treat non-small lung cancers. Certain EGFR kinase domain mutations underlie dramatic sensitivity to EGFR TKIS but we have shown that acquired resistance to EGFR TKIS invariably occurs and is often associated with the T790M resistance mutation of EGFR and represents a significant problem for patients with lung cancer. Further understanding of the mechanisms underlying this process will facilitate ways to both to both overcome and suppress the development of acquired resistance. These projects focus our effort on building strong bench-to-bedside and back-to-bench research. This iterative research approach to develop novel targeted therapy is critical to our success in the fight against cancer.",1995-05-16T12:05:00Z,2014-02-28T12:02:00Z,RFA-CA-02-011;RFA-CA-07-031,nofo_CA-07-031,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,NEW YORK,NY,UNITED STATES,etctn
U01CA069912,Phase I Clinical Trials of Anticancer Agents,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We will conduct Phase I clinical trials of new anticancer agents or combinations of anticancer agents for the purposes of characterizing drug toxicity, determining the maximum tolerated dose, performing pharmacogenetic analysis, evaluating the pharmacokinetics, and relating clinical endpoints to the derived pharmacokinetic parameters, pharmacogenetics, and/or relevant biologic endpoints. A major focus of this application is the study agents that interact with novel targets such as signal transduction pathways, cell cycle regulation checkpoints, DNA repair pathways and apoptosis regulators, either alone or in combination with standard chemotherapy. The endpoints for the evaluation of such treatments will be clinical effect (toxicity and antineoplastic response) as well as alterations in biochemical pathways affected in preclinical model systems. The specific aims of these studies are: to determine as efficiently as is compatible with patient safety the appropriate dose of new anticancer agents selected by the National Cancer Institute for evaluation of therapeutic activity in subsequent Phase II trials; to identify clinical, pharmacokinetic or other laboratory parameters that may predict toxicity; to determine whether functional polymorphisms of drug metabolizing or other enzymes associated with drug response alter pharmacokinetics, toxicity and/or activity of agents being studied; and to evaluate biological endpoints that may be used as surrogate markers of drug effect. Studies of drug combinations will be designed based on preclinical data identifying the appropriate schedule and exposure duration of the agents in vitro. Studies of novel modulating agents will be constructed to monitor and evaluate the intended modulation. Each new agent will be evaluated using a standard modified Fibonacci dose escalation scheme or novel dose-escalation methods as appropriate. Studies will be designed to incorporate the appropriate pharmacokinetic and pharmacogenetic analysis, drug analysis, and pharmacodynamic assessments. Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling of the data will be performed in those studies in which it is appropriate. By performing Phase I studies in this fashion, we will facilitate translation of novel preclinical observations into treatments that can be assessed for efficacy in Phase II and Phase III trials.",1996-03-01T12:03:00Z,2014-02-28T12:02:00Z,RFA-CA-02-011;RFA-CA-07-031,nofo_CA-07-031,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,ROCHESTER,MN,UNITED STATES,etctn
U01CA070095,Phase I Clinical Trials of New Anti-Cancer Targeted Therapies,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is to evaluate promising new therapies for patients with malignant disease in a clinically efficient, regulatory-compliant, and scientifically rigorous research environment. Phase I clinical studies of new anti-cancer therapies continue to evolve as basic / translational research has broadened the targeted opportunities to treat malignant disease. Building upon a strong foundation in the conduct of phase I studies, we have assembled an interactive research team that uses rationally designed clinical trials that enhances the molecular / pharmacologic assessment of new drug activity. These trials and assessment methods are designed ultimately to impact on the clinical care of patients diagnosed with cancer. The overall objective of these Phase l/ll studies is to determine the appropriate dose and schedule of experimental agents for further evaluation of efficacy in solid tumor /hematologic malignancies and to characterize the acute and chronic toxicities of these anti-cancer therapies. Our Specific Aims are 1) To conduct Phase I clinical trials of novel anti-cancer agents (alone or in combination) in a timely manner; 2) To perform detailed pharmacokinetic studies of these new agents and to correlate these observations with relevant clinical I biologically sound endpoints; 3) To implement correlative and pharmacodynamic laboratory evaluations in proof of drug mechanism phase I clinical trials and to explore optimal relationships between parameters of drug exposure and biological effects; and 4) To maintain a clinical trial infrastructure that is current and compliant with regulatory standards that assure quality care to patients enrolled on early phase clinical trials. Over the past 4 years, our UO1 Phase I program has enrolled over 500 patients (131 patients/year average), completed 12 trials, submitted 38 Letters of Intent, have 12 ongoing trials and 4 new trials approved, and have over 80 publications directly related to this Collaborative agreement. Our research group remains flexible to expansion and to explore other targets of interest / trial designs as well as well-positioned to further incorporate novel imaging into our early phase clinical trials. Given our productivity, experience, and expertise in early phase clinical trials, we fully expect to enroll 100 patients / year and to complete 2-3 phase l/ll clinical trials/ year via this cooperative agreement.

U01CA076576,Phase I Trials of Anti-Cancer Agents,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Phase I studies play a critical role in the development of new cancer therapies. These trials are the initial interface between basic and clinical research for ""first in human"" studies. Successful therapeutic research embodies an iterative process between the clinic and the laboratory during this critical period of initial development. Whereas in the past, phase I trials focused strictly upon defining the toxicity and pharmacokinetics of new agents, the current emphasis requires that more information is efficiently procured without compromising the analysis of safe and effective administration. This mandate requires real-time procurement of pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacogenomics as well as meticulous clinical assessment. In this application, both clinical and basic science investigators of The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center (OSUCCC) join in a collaborative approach to conduct phase I trials of new cancer therapeutic agents and regimens. Investigators will cooperate closely with the National Cancer Institute in developing correlative studies to evaluate clinical outcomes in the context of basic science observations. The present application builds upon approximately 30 years of experience and the scientific strength of the OSUCCC in conducting clinical trials with pertinent biologic measurements. Trials will target agents and strategies with which our faculty has prior preclinical experience and/or cellular and molecular networks under study in their laboratories. The Experimental Therapeutics Program at OSUCCC has expertise in signal transduction pathways, angiogenesis, cell cycle control, selective induction of tumor cell apoptosis, monoclonal antibodies, molecular genetics, histone protein modification, DMA methylation and other basic targeted therapeutic strategies. The Ohio State University represents one of the most comprehensive biomedical research campuses in the world dedicated to interdisciplinary research. Respective scientists associated with experimental therapy of cancer form a critical mass within the Colleges of Medicine and Public Health, Pharmacy, Biological Sciences, Mathematical and Physical Sciences, Veterinary Medicine, Engineering, Dentistry, and Nursing. This is a Phase I clinical trials program designed to achieve the ultimate goals of expedient (yet thorough) dose-finding trials in man with the intention of providing safe and effective new therapy to benefit patients with malignant diseases.",1998-04-15T12:04:00Z,2015-02-28T12:02:00Z,RFA-CA-02-011;RFA-CA-07-031,nofo_CA-07-031,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,COLUMBUS,OH,UNITED STATES,etctn
U01CA086400,Great Lakes New England Clinical Validation Center,"The Great Lakes New England Clinical Validation Center (GLNE CVC), a Clinical Validation Consortium component of the Early Detection Research Network (EDRN) is a highly collaborative group of investigators whose aims to validate biomarkers for the early detection and risk assessment of cancers of the gastrointestinal tract. In this fifth competitive application, the GLNE continues to test the overall hypothesis that a panel of circulating and stool based biomarkers will increase the adherence to colorectal screening and in doing so reduce mortality caused by colorectal cancers. Based on the rising incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) among adults age <50 in the US, and the low compliance and high mortality in underserved populations, increased emphasis is placed on these populations. The GLNE also proposes to continue its ongoing support of EDRN discovery priorities. We propose to address the following aims: (1) Primary Aim To expand and renew the archive of appropriately preserved stool, serum, plasma, urine, tissue and DNA biospecimens to be used by EDRN investigators for current and future validation and biomarker discovery research with expanded inclusion of subjects with early-onset CRC and underserved populations. This will allow assessment of the utility of individual stool-based, and serum-based biomarkers and biomarker panels for discriminating between individuals without neoplasia (subjects both at average and higher risk for developing colon cancer), and those with colon cancer or screen-relevant neoplasia (cancer plus advanced adenoma), and construction of panels of markers to discriminate between these groups. (2) To perform validation trials of promising biomarkers discovered by EDRN investigators, external collaborating institutions and collaborating EDRN industrial partners for the early detection of colorectal neoplasia. In this context we propose to (a) to clinically validate (via a methods comparison study) the performance of a point-of-care blood- based biomarker panel with the testing of serum/plasma samples obtained in clinics serving low-income and underserved communities and (b) to clinically validate an established 4-plex stool protein panel for early diagnosis of CRC. (3) To follow prospectively subjects enrolled in an established prospective Phase 2 validation trial to identify pre-diagnostic specimens which may be used to develop predictive markers.",2000-05-15T12:05:00Z,2027-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-14-015;RFA-CA-21-033,nofo_CA-21-033,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,HOUSTON,TX,UNITED STATES,edrn
U01CA086402,San Antonio Center for Biomarkers of Risk for Prostate Cancer (SABOR),"﻿ DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prostate cancer is the most common non-cutaneous cancer in American men. In May of 2012, the U.S. Preventive Task Force recommended that serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) screening no longer be recommended as standard clinical practice. A factor contributing to this recommendation is that many prostate cancers diagnosed via PSA-screening are indolent disease that will never progress. Current American Urologic Association recommendations stress informed decision making. To this end, this Clinical Validation Center will address the following major unmet clinical needs: 1) Optimize serum PSA screening protocols to identify men with aggressive diseases and reduce screening and detection of men with low risk disease (aim 1); 2) Validate markers that distinguish indolent versus aggressive disease using serum, DNA, urine, and tissue markers (aims 1 and 2); 3) Enhancing risk assessment for informed decision for individual patients, improving their ability to determine if a biopsy is in their best interest; 4) Develop a risk assessment tool for men on active surveillance to assist patients and physicians with decision making regarding biopsy. The SABOR EDRN Clinical Validation Center, established in 2000, has a long history of development of new tests for prostate cancer and critically evaluating such tests to ensure that, if they are used in the clinic, patients benefit from their use. Using the 4000-man SABOR cohort with other established cohorts (e.g., SWOG PCPT and PASS), Phase II and III validation studies will be conducted to improve biomarker performance related to prostate cancer risk and long term disease outcomes. The first aim focuses on assessing long term performance of current biomarkers including PHI, PCA3 and TMPRSS2:ERG. Also proposed in this aim are validation studies of constitutional genetic variants that may identify men at greater cancer risk or who are more likely to have poor disease outcomes. In aim 2, tissue microarrays (TMAs) will be developed for validating published markers of prognosis. In addition, TMAs that allow evaluation of performance of new tissue-based markers in ethnical/racial diverse tumors will be constructed. For the third aim, the PCPT risk calculator will be refined and a new tool developed to help men on active surveillance determine if a surveillance biopsy is necessary. The Center will continue its work to provide carefully-collected samples from patients to other investigators to either help discover the tests of the future or to conduct studies to ensure that the tests trul help patients. In addition, the SABOR scientific personnel will continue to provide service in leadership positions of the EDRN to ensure that the entire Network accelerates toward the goal of successful early detection and cure of cancer.",2000-05-15T12:05:00Z,2020-03-31T12:03:00Z,RFA-CA-14-015,nofo_CA-14-015,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCIENCE CENTER,SAN ANTONIO,TX,UNITED STATES,edrn
U01CA099118,Biomarker Studies for Novel Anti-Cancer Agents,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this UO1 phase I application is to efficiently and safely conduct dose finding, pharmacological, and bio-marker evaluation clinical trials of novel anti-cancer agents from the NCI. Information from phase I studies will guide selection of optimal dose and schedule for further study. Most new anti-cancer agents are mechanism-based, have limited toxicities, limited single agent activity, and may be most effective in combination with other therapies, or in populations expressing a specific molecular target or targets. For successful development of such agents, it is essential to provide evidence that these agents hit the intended molecular targets in patients before moving these agents into full scale clinical development. It is also critical to better understand the physiological consequences of this effect in relation to the new agent's activity and toxicity early in clinical development. We propose the following specific aims: 1.To define and describe agents' dose limiting and non-dose limiting toxicities, and provide evidence of clinical activity. 2. To define the pharmacokinetic properties of novel agents, including absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination. We will evaluate the pharmacodynamic effect of these parameters on toxicity, efficacy, and target inhibition or stimulation. 3. To evaluate novel biomarker and/or imaging studies that will provide proof of principle for an agent's activity at the target level, and to correlate these with other clinical and pharmaco- kinetic /pharmacodynamic endpoints. 4. To define a phase II dose based upon all available toxicity, efficacy, PK, PD, imaging, and biomarker data. Since the novel agents that will become available in the NCI pipeline are not completely known at this time, we will focus our approaches on classes of agents for which we have both scientific expertise and a track record of productive translational clinical investigation, including, 1) agents targeting tumor angiogenesis; 2) agents targeting tumor or tumor-stromal growth factor inhibition; and 3) novel vaccine and other immunomodulatory agents. We are also expert in studying agents targeted to brain tumor patients for phase I agents. We anticipate 2-3 studies per year. We will emphasize single agent studies but can evaluate combinations of novel agents or with standard chemotherapeutics or radiation therapy. We will emphasize the development and use of correlative biomarker and imaging approaches. Our ex- pertise in phase I clinical trial, large patient base, clinical infrastructure, and depth in basic and translational cancer biology and pharmacology will allow us to efficiently accomplish the goals of this proposal.",2003-05-28T12:05:00Z,2008-02-29T12:02:00Z,RFA-CA-02-011,nofo_CA-02-011,DUKE UNIVERSITY,DURHAM,NC,UNITED STATES,etctn
U01CA099168,Early Clinical Trials of New Anti-Cancer Agents with Phase I Emphasis,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The premise behind this grant application is that impeccable characterization and understanding of a systemically administered new antineoplastic agent's pharmacology and effect on molecular targets in cancer should allow better clinical utilization of that agent. Determination of clinical toxicities and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of an agent is no longer sufficient. Ideally, early clinical trials of an investigational agent should define pharmacokinetic (PK) disposition and metabolism, with correlation to pharmacodynamic (PD) manifestations at molecular, cellular, and clinical levels. With this abiding philosophy and hypothesis, performance of scientifically directed phase I trials of promising novel anti-cancer agents available through the National Cancer Institute is warranted. Integrating information regarding the mechanism of action and effect on molecular targets with development of biomarkers in phase I trials is the strategy that will be pursued with the following objectives to : define the toxicities of new antineoplastic agents in patients with advanced cancer; re-define (as necessary)the toxicities and PK of existing anticancer agents administered in combination with molecularly targeted agents, colony stimulating factors and other toxicity-ameliorating agents that may facilitate the exploration of more effective doses and schedules; provide information on the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination of antitumor agents; define treatment regimens for use in phase II trials; establish, based on clinical and pharmacologic characteristics, appropriate phase II doses in special patient populations (e.g., patients with impaired organ function; heavily pretreated patients or geriatric patient populations), explore PK and PD differences based on sex, race, or ethnic group; obtain preliminary information on PK/PD correlations that can then be extended in phase II trials; incorporate basic laboratory and correlative science studies, when possible and appropriate, to enhance the understanding of the biochemical and/or biological mechanisms of drug actions; study the PK and the PD impact of drugs on specific metabolic pathways and molecular targets using non-invasive techniques such as magnetic resonance spectroscopy and nuclear imaging with radio-labeled drugs; and integrate pharmacogenomic studies to characterize differences in relevant drug metabolizing enzymes and drug targets related to toxicity and efficacy.",2003-03-18T12:03:00Z,2015-02-28T12:02:00Z,RFA-CA-02-011;RFA-CA-07-031,nofo_CA-07-031,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,PITTSBURGH,PA,UNITED STATES,etctn

Drug development in oncology is rapidly changing. As laboratory investigations continue to elucidate mechanisms that contribute to the malignant phenotype, targets for anticancer therapy emerge. In the past, the major focus was on agents that interfered directly with the cellular replication machinery, whereas the current focus is on agents that target aberrant biological pathways. Nonetheless, regardless of the specific target, phase I trials in oncology are critical to the successful clinical development of novel agents. The overall objective of this proposal is to conduct early dose-ranging studies of investigational anticancer agents with an emphasis on biological correlates, pharmacological studies, analysis in the geriatric population, and novel combination regimens. The specific aims of this proposal are to : 1) determine the acute and chronic toxicity profiles, tolerability, and optimal dose of new agents in cancer patients including the geriatric population, 2) utilize biological markers and functional imaging to derive efficacious doses and schedules of targeted agents, 3) determine the pharmacological profile and pharmacodynamic relationships of novel agents using standard and physiologically-based methods, and 4) develop and analyze rational combination strategies of agents with standard chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and other targeted agents using the endpoints described above.",2003-04-07T12:04:00Z,2009-02-28T12:02:00Z,RFA-CA-02-011,nofo_CA-02-011,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,AURORA,CO,UNITED STATES,etctn
U01CA099177,Vanderbilt Phase I Translational Research Program,"This proposal describes a combined effort of the Vanderbilt-Ingram Comprehensive Cancer Center (VICCC), the Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) and, eventually, the Meharry Medical Center (MMC), to expand ongoing efforts in Phase I clinical research and establish a Phase I Translational Research Program. The goals of this proposal are to conduct early phase, dose-ranging trials of new anticancer agents to characterize their toxicity and pharmacology as well as to explore their effects on molecular targets to provide new scientific insights into drug mechanisms of action and determinants of response. The Program brings together clinical investigators experienced in early phase clinical trials with basic scientists at Vanderbilt who are studying the biology of molecules, such as EGFR and COX-2, that are the focus of some of the most promising molecularly-targeted therapies. Working together, these researchers have taken advantage of complementary skills and interests to design and initiate innovative translational research studies. Pharmacokinetic analysis of novel compounds will be performed using highly sensitive and specific methods of drug quantitation including HPLC, LC/MS, and GC/MS methodology. The excellent resources available at VICCC and VUMC will promote the expansion of pharmacogenetic analyses in early phase clinical trials of novel agents using hypothesis-testing as well as hypothesis-generating approaches. Pharmacodynamic relationships will be explored using PK as well as PG data. Data is presented that highlight recent accomplishments of the Phase ! effort at Vanderbilt and establish the adequacy of patient resources needed to carry out 2-3 translational research studies per year under this cooperative agreement. Over the past 4 years there has been a 63% increase in the number of studies open, a 38% increase in the number of patients enrolled, more than a doubling of the number of physicians entering patients into Phase I studies, and a doubling of the number of physicians writing and chairing Phase t trials. Data is also presented demonstrating the regional impact of Vanderbilrs Phase I program in the Southeast United States, an area currently without an NCI-designated Phase I center. We describe our plan for the graduated involvement of MMC in this cooperative agreement that will enhance both the access of African-American patients to Phase I clinical trials and the involvement of clinical and basic researchers from Meharry in the design and conduct of these early phase translational research studies. In summary, we believe that the support from this cooperative agreement will significantly enhance our efforts to understand the clinical, pharmacologic, and molecular impact of important new anficancer agents and optimize their further development and utilization.",2003-03-14T12:03:00Z,2009-02-28T12:02:00Z,RFA-CA-02-011,nofo_CA-02-011,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,NASHVILLE,TN,UNITED STATES,etctn
U01CA113913,"Emory, Harvard & Univ. of Washington Prostate Cancer Biomarker Center","﻿ DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We hypothesize that early detection, targeting aggressive prostate cancer, will enable survival benefits of treatment for lethal disease, and reduce harms of over-treatment for indolent disease. Toward this goal, we assemble biospecimen sample sets via rigorous SOP's in cohorts designed to avoid bias. We provide these specimens and guidance regarding study design to Discovery Labs, industry and consortia. Team efforts between the DMCC, the Hopkins BRL, industry partners, UTHSC-SA and our CVC facilitated FDA approval of the Prostate Health Index (phi - with data from our CVC's first cycle), and urinary PCA3 (with data from the current cycle). In two funding cycles, our CVC enrolled 4,821 subjects. We helped advance the TMPRSS2:Erg fusion (T2:Erg) discovery by the Chinnaiyan BDL toward actionable clinical use, completing 3 Aims with progress on the 4th: First, we combined urinary detection of T2:Erg with urinary PCA3 to improve specificity of detecting cancers with Gleason score > 7, validated this algorithm in a multi-center cohort, and showed the potential to reduce health care cost via this algorithm in men less than 65 years old. Second, we characterized community-based distribution of urinary T2:Erg, PCA3, and phi independent of PSA screening, and found race- based differences in these parameters, paving the way for a phase IV screening trial (separate proposal under review by DOD). Third, we compared prostatectomy tissue Erg expression to urinary T2:Erg, guiding the range of appropriate urinary T2:Erg cut-points to reflect tissue status. Fourth, we procured biopsies from two nation- wide, retrospective watchful waiting cohorts (PHS and HPFS), enrolled subjects onto the PASS Trial, and assembled a biospecimen set suitable for evaluating multiplex RNA's to discern aggressive from indolent disease. Recognizing limitations of T2:Erg as a classifier of cancer aggressiveness, we initiated clinical translation of a 24-gene, multiplex RNA panel for discerning aggressive from indolent prostate cancer; showed the feasibility of this assay in biopsy tissue and urine, and identified an industry partner to evaluat this signature on a clinical grade platform. We will expand our validation studies to include imaging to assess cancer severity based on FACBC, a PET radiotracer undergoing clinical development. We are expanding the breadth of our CVC from previously being limited to academic medical centers (AMC's), to now including an urban indigent care hospital, a Veterans Administration Medical Center, and a suburban community hospital (in addition to our host AMC) so that we project enrolling 1050 African-American men, substantially diversifying the EDRN biospecimen resource.

PMH and its research arm Ontario Cancer Institute (OCI), both as part of the University Health Network (UHN), have achieved an international reputation as a global leader in the fight against cancer. The goals of PMH Phase I Consortium include: 1) To design and implement early phase studies that determine the safety and tolerability profiles, pharmacologic and molecular effects, as well as preliminary clinical efficacy of investigational anti-cancer agents; 2) to provide appropriate patient populations access to I investigational anti-cancer agents via participation in clinical trials. The research and health care environment and the patient populations in our consortium are ideal for the conduct of phase I trials. The PMH Consortium has the patient referral base, experience, expertise, personnel, infrastructure, equipment I and facilities to conduct phase I single agent or combination trials, limited phase II trials and/or pilot trials of novel targeted agents. The PMH Phase I Consortium is committed to mount NCI-sponsored clinical trials as our top priority research effort. Our approach in the PMH Phase I Consortium for correlative laboratory studies to evaluate the pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and pharmacogenomic endpoints in phase I trials of new agents, are illustrated using specific examples. The exact set of correlative studies to be performed with a novel agent will depend on the type of agent being evaluated, its molecular mechanism(s) of action, and existent knowledge. Relevance to public health: In phase I trials, new cancer treatments or combinations are tested on humans for the first time and they help determine how a drug should be given, how often it should be given, and how much is safe. Cancer is one of the leading causes of death and suffering worldwide and efforts at controlling and curing cancer continue to be needed.

Discovery and clinical evaluation of new anti- cancer agents is one of the highest strategic objectives of the Cancer Institute of New Jersey (CINJ), the only NCI-designated comprehensive cancer center in New Jersey. From its inception, CINJ has focused on development of early clinical trials with a translational emphasis. CINJ clinical investigators have an outstanding record of translational clinical trial development, including pharmacokinetic/biomarker studies in several phase I/pilot trials supported by grants from the NCI. This expertise encompasses a wide range of drug targets, including cellular signaling pathways as well as novel immunologic, DNA-, and microtubule- associated targets. From 2004-2006, 42 phase I or pilot trials were active at CINJ, with an average annual accrual of 151 patients to these trials. Scientific themes within these studies included statistically driven dose- and schedule-finding algorithms, as well as validation of target modulation by biochemical studies of cancer tissues. CINJ provides an exceptional and unique resource for early clinical trials of new anti-cancer agents. Expected to reach a population of 9,000,000 by 2008, New Jersey has the highest population density in the United States, with an average of 1,174 people per square mile, which is 13 times the national average. Approximately 70,000 patient visits occur yearly at the main CINJ facility, and over 6000 new patients are seen each year.

U01CA152637,Fred Hutchinson Breast Cancer Clinical Validation Center,"ABSTRACT There remain clear clinical and public health needs to improve the early detection of breast cancer. While mammography is an effective tool, there are issues with respect to optimizing its use and performance, and despite widespread screening breast cancer remains the 2nd most common cause of cancer related death among U.S. women. Through the current EDRN Clinical Validation Center (CVC) led by Dr. Li we have validated 15 candidate biomarkers through a series of Phase 2 and Phase 3 validation studies that involved successive series of three independent sets of preclinical samples. Outside of EDRN funding, Dr. Partridge has led the development of novel strategies to improve breast cancer detection based on quantitative markers derived from screening MRIs in high-risk women and application of artificial intelligence (AI) approaches in collaboration with Microsoft. Our overarching goal is to conduct Phase 2 and 3 validation studies of blood- based biomarkers and imaging strategies that will be integrated and jointly assessed in a Phase 4 validation study. Supporting this goal we propose the following 4 projects: Project 1: Phase 3 validation of early detection biomarkers for ER+ breast cancer; Project 2: Phase 2 and 3 validation of protein biomarkers for the early detection of breast cancer discovered using a mass spectrometry-based platform; Project 3: Phase 3 validation of quantitative markers and AI algorithms applied to MRI screening exams for the early detection of breast cancer in women at high risk; and Project 4: Phase 4 validation of blood-based biomarkers and imaging algorithms for the early detection of breast cancer. Additionally, we will provide biospecimens and expertise to support high quality PRoBE compliant EDRN discovery and validation studies across several cancer types. With the combined expertise of our multidisciplinary team of investigators and our engagement with key commercial partners, this CVC will both lead well-justified, rigorously designed validation studies and provide abundant resources to EDRN. Given the strength of our biomarker candidates, the sets of biospecimens that will be used, the study designs employed, and the clearly delineated clinical applications proposed, we anticipate that this work will yield near-term clinical impact.",2010-08-16T12:08:00Z,2027-07-31T12:07:00Z,RFA-CA-14-015;RFA-CA-21-033,nofo_CA-21-033,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER CENTER,Seattle,WA,UNITED STATES,edrn
U01CA152662,Clinical Utility of a Combined Biomarker Approach to Diagnose Lung Cancer,"PROJECT SUMMARY Lung cancer remains the number one cancer killer in the United States and clinically useful biomarkers are needed to improve early detection and diagnosis. The objectives of this proposal for our continuing Clinical Validation Center are to push early lung cancer detection biomarkers into clinical practice while continuing to serve as a core resource to the EDRN, as well as to our academic and industry partners. Our overall objective is to demonstrate that biospecimen and imaging biomarkers will provide clinical utility to diagnose lung cancer by reducing the number of invasive procedures performed for benign disease and the time to diagnosis for cancer. Aim 1 will seek to demonstrate clinical utility of a combined biomarker and radiomic approach for providing Indeterminate Pulmonary Nodule (IPN) diagnoses. We will expand the existing lung specimen and imaging biorepository available to the scientific community, demonstrate the clinical utility of combination biospecimen and radiomic biomarkers, and validate additional candidate lung cancer risk biomarkers. We will diversify the population and enhance statistical power by recruiting from existing partnerships funded by prior EDRN funding: Meharry Medical College and Washington University in St. Louis. We seek to accomplish three objectives in this aim: 1) to validate the combined approach of hsCYFRA 21-1 cancer biomarker, radiomic (HealthMyne) biomarker and a Histoplasmosis benign biomarker (MiraVista) in the EDRN Lung Team Project 2 and National Lung Screening Trial reference cohorts, 2) to determine the clinical utility of the Histoplasmosis test followed by a Combined Biomarker Model (hsCYFRA21-1, radiomics, and Mayo Model) in a Phase 4 randomized clinical trial and 3) to validate new candidate blood and epithelial biomarkers in Phase 2 and 3 prospective- specimen-collection and retrospective-blinded-evaluation (PRoBE) design studies for the early diagnosis of lung cancer. In Aim 2 we will validate radiomic risk assessment platforms in IPNs and conduct a pilot clinical implementation trial in screening discovered IPNs. We will leverage the robust bioinformatics infrastructure at Vanderbilt University Medical Center to capture and deidentify 800 thoracic CT scans in patients with IPNs. A Lung Cancer Prediction Convolutional Neural Network (LCP-CNN) and the HealthMyne radiomic model will be compared to each other and against the Lung-RADS categories. We will perform a prospective pilot evaluation of the best performing model in Lung-RADS category 3 and 4 IPNs. To accomplish Aim 2 we will: 1) compare the accuracy of LCP-CNN and HealthMyne radiomics 2) determine the LCP-CCN's ability to reclassify nodules in screening patients in a prospective clinical implementation pilot study. At the completion of this proposal, we will have 1) evaluated clinical utility of combining lung cancer biospecimen and imaging biomarkers, 2) developed a platform within current practice to present an imaging biomarker approach to improve IPN risk assessment, and 3) enhanced the biorepository resource for the EDRN and collaborative use.",2010-08-16T12:08:00Z,2027-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-14-015;RFA-CA-21-033,nofo_CA-21-033,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,NASHVILLE,TN,UNITED STATES,edrn
U01CA176058,The Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Cancer Target Discovery and Development Center,"Abstract International efforts to characterize cancer genomes now provide us with an initial view of the mutations and copy number alterations that occur in human cancers. These efforts have expanded our knowledge of known oncogenic pathways and have identified new classes of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. However, it is now also clear that most epithelial cancers harbor hundreds of genetic alterations as a consequence of genomic instability, which complicates efforts to identify mutations critical for tumor maintenance and drives tumor heterogeneity. Moreover, it remains unclear which of these alterations confers on the tumor cell the ability to evade the immune system. The emerging clinical success of checkpoint blockade is tempered by the observation that most patients do not respond to immunotherapy. New immunotherapy targets are needed to improve tumor responses and guide rational combination immunotherapy to overcome resistance. Identifying genes that are essential for tumor survival and immune evasion will accelerate the development of new molecularly targeted therapeutics. Over the past several years, we have developed and deployed high throughput genetic and bioinformatics approaches to identify and credential cancer targets. Specifically, we have performed genome scale loss of function and gain of function screens in large sets of human cancer cell lines and patient-derived models and have identified new oncogenes and synthetic lethal interactions. The scale of these experiments has allowed us to overcome the inherent heterogeneity of cancers and to classify cancer dependencies and their context, which is essential for the initiation of drug discovery efforts. In this application, we propose to use these studies as a foundation for a new Dana-Farber Cancer Institute CTD2 Center. This Center will focus on the identification of and credentialing cancer targets, developing the means to rationally define combination therapies, and the identification of genes that modulate the response to immunotherapeutics, all through the use of novel in vitro and in vivo HT genetic and bioinformatic approaches. We will continue to make the outputs of these studies readily available to the scientific community and to participate in CTD2 Network activities. We anticipate that this Center will provide the cancer research community with information that will facilitate the prioritization of targets based on both genomic and functional evidence, inform the most appropriate genetic context for downstream mechanistic studies and facilitate the translation of this information into therapeutics and diagnostics.",2013-05-01T12:05:00Z,2023-07-31T12:07:00Z,RFA-CA-16-014,nofo_RFA-CA-16-014,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,BOSTON,MA,UNITED STATES,ctd_2
U01CA199000,NCI Pediatric In Vivo Testing Program - Leukemia,"Project Summary/Abstract This application seeks renewal of funding for a Research Program for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in vivo testing as part of the NCI Pediatric In Vivo Testing Program (Ped-In Vivo-TP). Recent US Government legislation, combined with the relative rarity and higher cure rates of childhood cancer compared with adults, emphasize the importance of new agent preclinical testing programs aimed at maximizing the likelihood that only the most active drugs will be advanced into early phase clinical trials. The broad aim of this application is to improve the treatment options for children with aggressive and/or drug resistant ALL by prioritizing new drugs for clinical trials in the disease using state-of-the-art preclinical experimental models. This aim will be accomplished using a large panel of 90 pediatric ALL patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) that have undergone a high level of cell and molecular characterization and authentication. The PDXs to be used in this study were all established as models of orthotopic disease in immune- deficient (NOD/SCID or NSG) mice from direct patient explants without prior ex vivo culture. The PDXs develop as systemic disease in NSG mice and infiltrate the same major organs in mice as the primary disease in human patients. Engraftment and responses to treatment are monitored by measuring the proportion of human leukemia cells in the peripheral blood of mice on a weekly basis, which provides a reliable representation of overall leukemia burden in the animals. Where luciferase-expressing PDXs are available, this testing will be augmented by bioluminescence imaging of animals. The broad methodology will involve inoculation of PDX cells into NSG mice, a lag time to allow the disease to establish, followed by drug treatment and monitoring to assess drug responses. Methods of response evaluation have been developed using stringent criteria modeled after the clinical setting, in order to minimize the likelihood of over-predicting drug responses in mice leading to failure of drugs in the clinic. The proposed drug testing will adopt multiple formats, including conventional drug testing (6- 10 mice/group), single-mouse trial testing (1 PDX x 1 mouse x 1 drug) and testing of new agents in combination with standard-of-care drugs. In this fashion, this Research Program aims to test 8-10 new agents per year. By completing the major objectives outlined in this proposal, the long term health benefit aims to improve the treatment options and quality of life for children with aggressive forms of ALL who would otherwise succumb to their disease.",2015-08-01T12:08:00Z,2026-06-30T12:06:00Z,RFA-CA-14-018;RFA-CA-20-034,nofo_RFA-CA-20-034,UNIVERSITY OF NEW SOUTH WALES,SYDNEY,,AUSTRALIA,pivot
U01CA199221,Genomically informed agent selection and testing in osteosarcoma patient-derived xenograft models,"Project Summary/ Abstract Survival outcomes for patients with osteosarcoma have not changed since the advent of modern chemotherapy four decades ago and it has been challenging to develop new effective therapies in this disease. Our lab’s long- term mission is to identify novel molecular targets in osteosarcoma via comprehensive genomic and proteomic profiling of patient-derived cell lines and xenografts as well as human tumors with the ultimate goal of identifying and/or developing and testing therapeutics against these targets. To achieve this goal, we have a) built a robust profiling platform to identify novel targets; b) expanded our repertoire of osteosarcoma patient derived xenograft (PDX) models to reflect disease heterogeneity; and c) conducted high-throughput in vivo testing of 8-10 new agents each year both as part of Pediatric Preclinical Testing Consortium (PPTC) as well as independent of it. All of these efforts form the basis of our current research proposal and place us strongly poised to successfully achieve our goals. Our overall objective is to efficiently evaluate the efficacy of new agents with high potential to have activity in osteosarcoma based on target data from our genomic and proteomic profiling both as single agents and in rational combinations, with the vision of moving effective agents into clinical trials through the Children’s Oncology Group. We have three specific aims- 1) to select and test agents in vivo against surface targets identified by comprehensive proteomic profiling of osteosarcoma xenografts and patient tumors; 2) to select and test agents in vivo against targets identified by comprehensive genomic profiling of osteosarcoma xenografts and patient tumors; and 3) to perform testing of rationally combined agents based on target, toxicity and efficacy data of single agents. Agents from the PPTC pipeline will be selected based on either the proteomic target or genomic alteration being present in at least a subset of available osteosarcoma PDX models. The agent will be tested in selected cohorts of low/ high expressing protein target or present/ absent genomic alteration. In cases with multiple models with target expression, 3-5 mice per model will be used and in cases with few models available, 8-10 mice per model will be used for control and experiment groups with an overall n per arm per experiment of approximately 30 mice. Standard PPTC procedures will be used for tumor implantation and treatment. Tumor dimensions will be measured twice a week and response quantified as per standard PPTC definitions of complete response, maintained complete response, partial response, stable disease and progressive disease. For combination studies, three potential types of combinations will be considered based on efficacy and toxicity data- a) two surface protein targeted agents such as two antibody-drug conjugates; 2) two molecularly targeted agents and 3) a surface protein targeted agent and a molecularly targeted agent. Our results will guide the development of the next generation of clinical trials in osteosarcoma.",2015-07-10T12:07:00Z,2026-06-30T12:06:00Z,RFA-CA-14-018;RFA-CA-20-034,nofo_RFA-CA-20-034,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,HOUSTON,TX,UNITED STATES,pivot
U01CA199287,Pediatric Preclinical Testing Consortium,"﻿ DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Children with disseminated neuroblastoma have a very high risk of treatment failure and death despite receiving intensified chemotherapy, radiation therapy and immunotherapy. The long-term goal of our laboratory is to substantively improve neuroblastoma cure rates by developing patient-specific therapies that target the unique oncogenic drivers of each case. Within the context of the Pediatric Preclinical Testing Consortium (PPTC) we propose a Neuroblastoma Research Program built on richly annotated and highly characterized patient derived xenograft (PDX) and other murine models. The central hypothesis to be tested in this Program is that oncogenic drivers of neuroblastoma can be defined and exploited through rationally designed combinatorial therapies based on validated and clinically measurable biomarkers. Through our dedicated focus on neuroblastoma and our central role in the former Pediatric Preclinical Testing Program, we have developed an investigative team, and rich set of resources and reagents, to be uniquely positioned to achieve the goals of the Program and the PPTC. Here we propose to use a large (and growing) collection of PDX models that have been fully characterized with the most modern genomic technologies to address three specific research aims. First, we will seek to exploit our recent discovery that high-risk neuroblastoma frequently harbor activating mutations in ALK or downstream components of the MAPK signaling pathway at the time of disease relapse. Here we will develop combinatorial therapies that not only directly target the pathway, but also a major bypass mechanism of resistance by simultaneously inhibiting the PI3K-AKT pathway. Second, we will seek to target the MYCN oncoprotein, the most well characterized oncogenic driver in high-risk neuroblastoma, via combined therapy of a bromodomain and extra-terminal repeat inhibitor with an inhibitor of the MAPK pathway. Third, we will seek to take advantage of the fact that inactivating mutations in major tumor suppressor genes such as TP53 and RB1 are rare in neuroblastoma, and that therapeutic strategies to trap these proteins in the nucleus will synergistically enhance cell death caused by DNA damaging agents. These exemplar Aims provide a roadmap for an evidence-based and hypothesis-driven research Program that will be positioned to pursue up to 10 research aims (preclinical therapeutic trials) annually through priorities set by the PPTC steering committee. The Neuroblastoma Research Program within the PPTC will deliver on the promise of biomarker-directed therapeutics in cancer by performing the pivotal preclinical studies that will greatly enhance our ability to design early phase clinica trials enriched for patients with high potential to benefit. Thus, this Program will seek to shift he paradigm for how high-risk neuroblastoma patients are treated with the goal of substantively improving the outcomes, both in terms of cure rates, but also by decreasing the toxicity associated with current standards of care.",2015-07-07T12:07:00Z,2021-06-30T12:06:00Z,RFA-CA-14-018,nofo_RFA-CA-14-018,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,PHILADELPHIA,PA,UNITED STATES,pivot
U01CA199288,In vivo Drug Testing of Pediatric CNS Tumors Using Patient Derived Orthotopic Xenograft Models,"This application is prepared in response to the funding opportunity: NCI Pediatric In Vivo Testing Program (U01), RFA-CA-20-034 to renew our existing PPTC UO1 grant. Specifically, we propose to continue the in vivo testing program for central nervous system (CNS) tumors using our panel of patient derived orthotopic xenograft (PDOX) models. Brain tumor is the leading cause of cancer-related death in children. One of the challenges in clinical drug development is how to effectively prioritize drug candidates to ensure clinical success in cancer patients. However, efforts in identifying new anti-cancer agents for that are most likely to be effective in the clinic have been blocked for many years due to the lack of clinically relevant and molecularly accurate model system. Fortunately, we have established a panel of 150 PDOX models of pediatric brain tumors through direct injection of patient tumor specimens into the brains of SCID mice. These PDOX models are shown to have replicated the histopathology and major genetic abnormalities of the original patient tumors even during serial sub-transplantations in vivo in mouse brains. They not only represent different clinical stage (i.e., at diagnosis, relapse and terminal/autopsy) but also replicate a broad spectrum of the newly identified molecular subtypes of nearly all types of pediatric brain tumors. The xenograft tumor cells can also be cryopreserved for sustained and on-demand supply of tumorigenic PDOX cells. This capacity combined with our optimized surgical procedure, with which we can implant up to 260 mice per day, makes it possible for us to test multiple (e.g., 6-10) drugs per year for every tumor type. Our objective is therefore to make use of this unique panel of PDOX models to examine therapeutic efficacy of new agents and to analyze mechanisms of action and therapy resistance in high grade glioma, medulloblastoma, ependymoma, DIPG and ATRT. Our hypothesis is that these patient-specific PDOX tumors will respond to anti-cancer therapies similarly to the corresponding human primary tumors, and the effective agents identified through this system would have better chances of clinical success. To test this hypothesis, we will perform a series of in vitro and in vivo assays to achieve the following aims: 1) to identify genetically accurate candidate PDOX models that bear the therapeutic target(s) of new investigational drugs through data mining of our mouse model molecular characterization databases; 2) to select the most responsive models through functional in vitro screening to determine time- and dose-responses; 3) to demonstrate therapeutic efficacy of new investigational drugs in multiple target-bearing PDOX models; and 4) to perform detailed analysis of cellular and molecular mechanisms of cell killing as well as the causes of therapy resistance both in vitro and in vivo. Our novel panel of PDOX mouse models represents a broad spectrum of genetic abnormalities of pediatric CNS tumors. All the assays are well established and routinely performed in our laboratory; we are uniquely positioned to accomplish the proposed drug studies in vivo. Our findings should provide strong preclinical evidence to support the initiation of clinical trials.",2015-07-14T12:07:00Z,2026-06-30T12:06:00Z,RFA-CA-14-018;RFA-CA-20-034,nofo_RFA-CA-20-034,LURIE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL OF CHICAGO,CHICAGO,IL,UNITED STATES,pivot
U01CA199297,Pediatric Preclinical Testing Consortium: Research Programs Non-CNS (U01),"﻿ DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is in response to the RFA (Type C: Research Program for other (non-CNS) solid tumors testing in vivo) to screen agents/combinations against soft tissue sarcoma (Ewing sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, other ST sarcomas) and kidney cancer models (Wilms tumor, rhabdoid). This group has evaluated over 80 agents/combinations using Patient Derived Xenografts (PDX) and cell line derived xenografts as part of the Pediatric Preclinical Testing Program (PPTP). We have developed 12 rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) PDX models (7 alveolar [ARMS], 5 embryonal [ERMS]), 13 Ewing sarcoma (EWS) models (3 PDX). Additionally, we have 2 alveolar soft part sarcoma models and one each of clear cell sarcoma and undifferentiated sarcoma. In the kidney tumor panel we have developed PDX models representing Wilms tumors (n=8, 2 anaplastic), and 5 non-CNS malignant rhabdoid tumors. Using the xenograft models and SOPs developed in the PPTP, this team has demonstrated capability to provide high-quality, reproducible data evaluating single agents and combinations that have identified entities that have moved rapidly to clinical testing. Specific agents and combinations, identified as having biologically meaningful activity, and in early pediatric clinical trials will be the focus of the hypothesis-driven Aims of the research component: Hypothesis 1: That novel antimitotic agents, eribulin and abraxane will have synergistic interaction with the topoisomerase I poison, irinotecan in sarcoma models. Hypothesis 2. That inhibition of TOR kinase will downregulate the DNA damage repair protein FANCD2 and sensitize sarcomas to ionizing radiation therapy (XRT). Hypothesis 3. Because alveolar soft part sarcomas (ASPS) express very high membrane-associated glycoprotein GPNMB, these tumors will be sensitive to glembatumumab vedotin, an antibody-drug conjugate that targets GPNMB. Further, that glembatumumab will synergize with cediranib, and inhibitor of angiogenesis, and the only identified effective therapeutic for this rare solid tumor. Each study will incorporate pharmacodynamics measures that will inform as to the mechanism of synergy, or failure to synergize as anticipated. Based on outcomes, and results of these PD studies, combinations or sequencing of combinations will be modified. The overall objective is to identify novel combinations that can inform clinical development of these new agents for treatment of childhood solid tumors.",2015-07-07T12:07:00Z,2021-06-30T12:06:00Z,RFA-CA-14-018,nofo_RFA-CA-14-018,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCIENCE CENTER,SAN ANTONIO,TX,UNITED STATES,pivot
U01CA200462,MD Anderson Cancer Center EDRN- CVC for Early Detection of Ovarian Cancer,"﻿ DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Advances in cytoreductive surgery and combination chemotherapy have improved 5-year survival in patients with epithelial ovarian cancer, but the rate of cure remains essentially unchanged over the last two decades. Computer models suggest that detection of ovarian cancer in early stage (I-II) could improve rates of cure by 10-30%. Sequential use of serum biomarkers measured over time followed by TVS in a small fraction of postmenopausal women with rising CA125 has proven more specific and more sensitive than either modality used alone. Using this strategy, the United Kingdom Collaborative Trial for Ovarian Cancer Screening (UKCTOCS) and the Normal Risk Ovarian Cancer Screening Study (NROSS) in the United States have shown that only 3 operations are required to detect each case of ovarian cancer. Over the last 13 years, our group has conducted the NROSS study in 4,904 postmenopausal women at average risk for ovarian cancer. Annual determinations of CA125 have been analyzed by the Risk of Ovarian Cancer Algorithm (ROCA) developed by Dr. Skates. If the risk does not change, women return in a year; if it increases markedly, TVS is performed and participants are referred to a gynecologic oncologist; if the risk is intermediate CA125 is repeated in 3 months. Fifteen operations have been performed to detect 10 ovarian cancers. Two were borderline tumors and 8 were invasive with 8 of the 10 (80%) in Stage I or II. The NROSS trial has utilized a well-coordinated network of 7 sites in the United States where 22,981 blood samples have been obtained, processed and stored with standard operating protocols. Pre-operative specimens from MDACC have been banked from 502 women with ovarian cancer and 737 with benign disease. This has provided a valuable resource for evaluating new biomarkers. As CA125 is expressed by only 80% of epithelial ovarian cancers, additional biomarkers will be required to optimize sensitivity. Our group has found that HE4 and CA72.4 can detect 16% of the cases missed by CA125 in samples from the UKCTOCS trial. Autoantibodies to tumor associated antigens have shown even greater promise. Elevated levels of autoantibodies against TP53 have been found in 20-25% of patients with normal CA125 at the time of conventional diagnosis. Titers of anti-TP53 rise 13.5 months (mean) prior to CA125 and 33 months (mean) prior to diagnosis in patients who present without an increase in CA125. At present we are developing a new ROCA that incorporates CA125, HE4, CA72.4 and anti-TP53 autoantibody data. A multidisciplinary team of 27 investigators will pursue the following Specific Aims: 1) to conduct a screening trial to determine the specificity and positive predictive value for a 4 biomarker ROCA including CA125, HE4, CA72.4 and anti-TP53 autoantibodies in a two stage strategy for early detection of ovarian cancer in postmenopausal women at average risk for the disease; 2) to maintain and share a serum and plasma bank to facilitate evaluation of novel biomarkers for early detection; 3) to collaborate with other Centers in the EDRN to evaluate additional biomarkers for early detection of ovarian cancer.",2016-05-05T12:05:00Z,2023-03-31T12:03:00Z,RFA-CA-14-015,nofo_CA-14-015,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,HOUSTON,TX,UNITED STATES,edrn
U01CA200464,Moffitt Imaging Biomarker VAlidation Center,"﻿ DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to establish the Moffitt Imaging Biomarker Validation Center (MIBVAC) focused on imaging biomarker validations for early cancer detection and accurate risk assessments by leveraging our team of strong experts, resources, planned imaging biomarker validation studies, and analysis and network collaboration structures. In previous studies we have demonstrated that various measurements from breast images quantify breast cancer risk. The large cooperative National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) also showed a significant survival improvement for individuals screened by low dose CT compared to those screened with conventional radiography. Additionally, we have recently shown that CT image analysis (radiomics) can improve classification in this data set. However, due to difficulties in obtaining accurate and reproducible measurements and high false-positive rates of current imaging, cancer imaging biomarkers have not been routinely incorporated into clinical risk assessment. If these imaging biomarkers can be accurately tailored at the individual level, their impact will be significantly improved for early cancer detection and intervention. MIBVAC plans to achieve this challenging yet quite achievable goal by rigorously evaluating and validating these imaging biomarkers for rapid translation into clinical and practical applications. We have four specific aims: (Aim 1) Establish breast imaging resources for EDRN both with our existing and new case-control datasets of breast images and to evaluate and validate breast imaging biomarkers based on newly-established case-control dataset of digital breast tomosynthesis (TS) images, (Aim 2) Evaluate and validate lung imaging biomarkers for early detection of cancer first based on NLST low-dose CT (LDCT) cohorts and then expanding with a newly-established case-control cohort of higher resolution LDCT, (Aim 3) Conduct validation studies with imaging biomarkers for EDRN partners and others for other malignancies, and (Aim 4) Refine and validate imaging biomarkers analytically for early detection of breast, lung, and other cancers and to construct MIBVAC imaging data and specimen resources for EDRN collaborations and sharing.",2016-07-01T12:07:00Z,2023-03-31T12:03:00Z,RFA-CA-14-015,nofo_CA-14-015,H.

U01CA200466,Validation of biomarkers for early diagnosis and risk prediction of pancreatic neoplasms,"﻿ DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A majority of pancreatic cancer (PC) patients (> 80%) present with an unresectable primary tumor with distant metastasis at the time of diagnosis due to its asymptomatic nature and lack of methods for early detection. While the overall 5-year survival rate of PC is dismal, signiﬁcantly better outcomes have been reported for early stage smaller tumors. PC is believed to progress through a series of histological changes and recent estimates indicate that these changes require 15-20 years to develop into invasive metastatic disease, hence providing a window of opportunity to intervene. While early diagnosis is an obvious strategy to improve the survival of PC patients, lack of non-invasive biomarkers for risk prediction of precursor lesions or early stage invasive disease impedes our ability to diagnose PC during this ""window. Premalignant cystic lesions of the pancreas offer unique opportunity for early diagnosis. To meet the EDRN stated goal of performing a validation study for early cancer detection and risk assessment likely to yield meaningful results within 5 years, we propose an innovative approach that could lead to the development of a clinically useful biomarker in this time frame. Additionally, we propose to study cystic neoplasms since IPMN and MCN offer a unique opportunity to identify pancreatic premalignant lesions and serve as a target for early detection strategies. The candidate biomarkers studies in our application have been identified and evaluated over the past 5 years in EDRN-funded biomarker developmental laboratories (BDLs). Studies from the laboratories of participating investigators have conclusively established that mucin overexpression is a hallmark of pancreatic cancer and have identified biomarkers (MUC5AC and its 2 glycoforms, MUC4 and a glycoform of endorepellin) that can effectively distinguish a) patients with resectable PC patients from patients with benign pancreatic diseases; b) mucinous and non- mucinous cysts; c) high-grade from moderate- and low-grade mucinous cysts and d). high-risk intestinal type IPMNs and low risk gastric type IPMNs. The overall objective of this CVC proposal is to demonstrate the ability of the aforementioned biomarkers to distinguish pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PC) patients from healthy controls, patients with benign biliary obstruction and chronic pancreatitis (CP), and to identify those cysts with high malignant potential. We have a large number of high quality, well-characterized specimens from patients with pancreatic disease and diseased controls that were collected and processed following protocols developed through the EDRN. Two specific aims are proposed. Aim 1 will use available samples from our biospecimen repository to evaluate MUC5AC and MUC4 as biomarkers to distinguish pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PC) patients from healthy controls, and from patients with benign biliary obstruction and chronic pancreatitis (CP). Aim 2 will determine if our biomarkers can identify those cysts with high lethal potential from those with a low risk for malignant transformation.",2016-05-17T12:05:00Z,2022-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-14-015,nofo_CA-14-015,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,PITTSBURGH,PA,UNITED STATES,edrn
U01CA200468,Clinical Validation Center for Early Detection of Pancreatic Cancer,"Abstract Early detection of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an area of highest priority and an unmet need for advancing public health in the United States. Certain sub-groups of patients, such as those with germline mutations, mucinous pancreatic cysts and new-onset diabetes (NOD) are at higher than average risk for PDAC. In the immediate prior cycle, our EDRN Clinical Validation Center (CVC) at MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC): (a) facilitated the conduct of the first ever, multi-institutional, blinded “biomarker bakeoff” in PDAC by providing annotated biospecimens, (b) completed one of the first EDRN-defined Phase 3 biomarker studies in PDAC using pre-diagnostic samples (Fahrmann et al, Gastroenterology 2021), and (c) served as a conduit for the implementation of additional EDRN collaborative research initiatives, including a pre-diagnostic PDAC imaging consortium. Our renewal application represents a Gulf Coast-Great Lakes EDRN Clinical Validation Center (GCGLEC) in Pancreatic Cancer is comprised of UTMDACC/Lyndon B Johnson Hospital (Harris Health, TX), Henry Ford Health System (HFHS, Detroit, MI) and Ochsner Health System (OHS, New Orleans, LA) and has three major objectives: First, to implement a multi-institutional framework for collecting the highest quality biospecimens from patients with a variety of well-defined pancreatic pathologies (including early stage PDAC, pancreatic cystic lesions, and other benign pancreatic diseases, such as chronic pancreatitis, benign cysts, and endocrine tumors of low malignant potential), in order to conduct biomarker validation studies for early detection of PDAC that conform to EDRN-defined Phase 2 and Phase 3 study design. Current PDAC biomarker studies typically have sparse representation from racial and ethnic minorities, and therefore a major impetus of the GCGLEC will be to address the “disparity gap” in biomarker research by obtaining biospecimens from underrepresented minorities. Second, the GCGLEC will build upon our published Phase 3 study utilizing the “anchor panel” of CA19-9, LRG1 and TIMP-1, by conducting four additional PRoBE-compliant studies that incorporate autoantibodies, metabolites and additional protein biomarkers for improving the sensitivity of diagnosing asymptomatic PDAC without compromising the 99% or greater specificity threshold. These EDRN- defined Phase 3 studies will be conducted in pre-diagnostic cases and controls obtained from existing cohorts, including the PLCO, WHI, and the so-called “Harvard cohorts” (NHS, PHS, WHS and HPFS), as well as ongoing prospective cohorts undergoing accrual, such as the NCI-funded New Onset Hyperglcyemia and Diabetes (NOD) cohort, and the Early detection Initiation (EDI) in PDAC, a collaboration between PanCAN and the NCI. Third, the GCGLEC will serve as a “hub” for collaborative activities within and outside the EDRN, including collaborations with investigators funded by the Pancreatic Cancer Detection Consortium (PCDC), and laying the foundations for conducting an EDRN-approved multi-institutional “clinical utility” (Phase 4 study) for PDAC early detection, within a CAP/CLIA environment.",2016-05-04T12:05:00Z,2027-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-14-015;RFA-CA-21-033,nofo_CA-21-033,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,HOUSTON,TX,UNITED STATES,edrn
U01CA209936,DEVELOPMENT OF INFORMATICS RESOURCES FOR INTERPRETATION OF CLINICALLY ACTIONABLE VARIANTS IN CANCER,"Abstract Clinical cancer sequencing will increasingly be used to identify genomic alterations that are relevant to understanding cancer progression and improving clinical decision making for individual patients. Currently, the most critical bottleneck in the precision medicine workflow is at the interpretation step. However, there are few resources to help with the prioritization and interpretation of these alterations in a clinical context. Multiple groups are building their own databases documenting clinical interpretation of tumor mutations as they are observed in those groups. This represents a largely redundant effort with no mechanisms for capturing evolving evidence from the biomedical literature. Public knowledgebases are needed with sophisticated application programming interfaces (APIs) that allow rapid intersection of genomic alterations with interpretations of their clinical actionability. The goal of this proposal is to develop such an expert-curated knowledgebase, web interface and API for Clinical Interpretation of Variants in Cancer (CIViC - www.civicdb.org). The knowledge created from this effort will be freely available and the product of open discussion across a diverse community. This will require an interdisciplinary approach to combine the expertise of genome scientists and cancer researchers, whose efforts are otherwise often isolated. Content will be created with transparency, kept current, be comprehensive, track provenance, and acknowledge the efforts of creators. It will cover all types of alterations from single nucleotide variants to structural variants, RNA fusions, expression changes, epigenetic alterations and others. The interface will capture both structured statements of evidence for actionability to allow computational data mining and also human-readable interpretations. Content and software will be unencumbered and easy to access to encourage both academic and commercial engagement. In order to achieve these goals CIViC will require well-designed data standards, use of structured vocabularies, and a user-friendly curation interface that balances data mining needs with human accessibility. Focused `hackathons' and curation meetings will be organized to establish community standards and coordinate with synergistic efforts by the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) and ClinGen working groups. The CIViC resource will serve as the foundation for development of applications critical to widespread implementation of precision medicine for cancer. Specifically, it will facilitate rapid generation of targeted sequencing assays, automated clinical report generation, and other applications built upon the open CIViC standards and APIs.",2016-07-20T12:07:00Z,2021-06-30T12:06:00Z,PAR-15-332,nofo_PAR-15-332,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,SAINT LOUIS,MO,UNITED STATES,itcr
U01CA213273,Novel therapeutic approaches for enhancing anti-tumor immunity in SCLC,"PROJECT SUMMARY Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a highly lethal malignancy for which new therapeutic strategies are desperately needed. One promising avenue is the use of immunotherapy (IMT) agents such as PD-1/PD-L1 pathway inhibitors. Despite its high mutation burden, however, data from our group and others indicate that SCLC paradoxically has an immunosuppressed phenotype with relatively low levels of infiltrating T-cells, reduced antigen presentation, and increased levels of CD47, a suppressor of myeloid function. Furthermore, initial clinical testing suggests that most SCLC tumors often express low or very low levels of PD-L1 and fail to respond to PD-1 inhibitor monotherapy; IMT resistance also inevitably emerges in responding tumors by mechanisms that have not yet been characterized. Thus, immunosuppressive mechanisms other than the PD- 1/PD-L1 pathway are likely to play a major role in SCLC, and novel therapeutic approaches and combination therapies are needed to realize the potential of IMT in SCLC. The goal of this proposal is to address this issue by identifying new IMT targets and novel combination regimens, and to rapidly translate them into the clinic. Our team already has promising leads. First, we identified that SCLC is highly vulnerable to drugs targeting DNA damage repair (DDR) including PARP and Chk1 inhibitors, a finding now supported by early clinical results. Our preliminary data further suggest that DDR inhibition may increase PD-L1 expression and, by increasing the production of tumor-associated neoantigens (TAA), may sensitize tumors to IMT. In Aim 1, we will test whether DDR inhibitors can increase the expression of TAAs, and enhance the efficacy of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. Second, we have developed a novel strategy for protecting immune cells from the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapy by using inhibitors of CDK4/6, which can be used to protect immune cells, but not RB-deficient SCLC cells. In Aim 2, we will test whether CDK4/6 inhibition can enhance the anti-tumor effects of immune cells by protecting them from chemotherapy-induced cytotoxicity and enable improved chemotherapy/IMT combinations in SCLC. Third, we have identified the “don't-eat-me” signal CD47 as a novel IMT target for SCLC; blockade of CD47 effectively promotes the phagocytosis of SCLC cells by macrophages and inhibits tumor growth. In Aim 3, we will test whether targeting this CD47 myeloid checkpoint can enhance antitumor immunity and the efficacy of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade and chemotherapy in vivo in SCLC models. The overall hypothesis tested here is that antitumor immunity can be enhanced in SCLC by targeting all these processes, leading to more effective IMT combination regimens. These studies will be facilitated by novel immune-competent pre-clinical murine SCLC models that we have developed and by a multidisciplinary team including clinical and laboratory investigators, immunologists, pathologists, and others with a record of innovation in SCLC and IMT and a track record of translating laboratory findings into the clinic.",2017-08-01T12:08:00Z,2022-07-31T12:07:00Z,PAR-16-049,nofo_PAR-16-049,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,HOUSTON,TX,UNITED STATES,sclc
U01CA213285,Development of Risk and Early Detection Biomarker for Small Cell Lung Cancer,"ABSTRACT The goal of this proposal by a multi-disciplinary team at MD Anderson Cancer Center, the University of Texas Southwestern Cancer Center and the University of Pittsburg Cancer Center is to explore approaches based on circulating protein markers and autoantibodies to develop a blood based marker panel to assess risk of harboring or developing small cell lung cancer (SCLC). There are currently several established SCLC protein markers which individually lack sufficient performance for early detection. Additionally, the applicant group has uncovered several protein marker candidates through integrated analyses of mouse models and human SCLC samples. To assess the potential of established and newly discovered candidate markers to yield a combined panel of markers indicative of risk of harboring or developing SCLC, validation studies will be conducted using plasma samples collected up to 5 years prior to a diagnosis of SCLC, from participants in the large European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) and the Singapore Chinese Health Study (SCHS) cohorts. Additonally, plasmas collected at the time of diagnosis of SCLC and post-treatment as well as tissue molecular profiles will be interrogated to establish the biological relevance to candidates to SCLC. Two approaches will be implemented to identify antigenic proteins and peptides that induce autoantibodies that can be mined for SCLC early detection. One consisting of Ig bound proteins in plasmas from SCLC cases and another novel approach consists of interrogating whole genome derived peptide arrays for reactivity with aliquots of SCLC plasmas utilized for validation of circulating proteins. The resulting combination of the most promising markers will be further validated using pre-diagnostic SCLC samples and matched controls from the US Prostate Lung Colon and Ovarian (PLCO) cohort. The applicant group has a substantial track record of collaboration and expertise relevant to project objectives, with rigor in experimental design for discovery and validation studies of lung cancer biomarkers.",2017-09-06T12:09:00Z,2022-08-31T12:08:00Z,PAR-16-051,nofo_PAR-16-051,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,HOUSTON,TX,UNITED STATES,sclc
U01CA213330,Extracellular Vesicles in Small Cell Lung Cancer Early Detection,"PROJECT SUMMARY Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. While the implementation of lung cancer screening for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) subtypes has brought significant hope to this disease, very limited options exist for the early detection of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) SCLC carries a 5-year survival rate of only 7% and despite the development of novel targeted therapies and early detection for NSCLC, no such advances have been achieved in SCLC. A gap in our current approach to lung cancer detection and treatment has been that informative and reliable biomarkers for the detection and surveillance of lung cancer have remained elusive. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as viable biomarkers in body fluids thus, providing an excellent means to achieve non-invasive assays for early cancer detection. Furthermore, miRNA expression in circulation appears to be compartment specific. While the majority of miRNAs are intracellular, a significant number of miRNAs have been observed outside of cells, including in various bodily fluids. The origin, applications and potential functionality of RNAs in circulation are the sources of intriguing questions. Obtaining a detailed RNA spectrum in plasma would shed some light on this matter. We have taken a multidisciplinary approach to the investigation of circulating RNA transcripts that integrates expertise in miRNA biology, nanoengineering, lung cancer and bioinformatics. We have developed a simple tethered Cationic Lipoplex Nanoparticle (tCLN) biochip with pre-loaded molecular beacons (MBs) in the lipoplex nanoparticles as probes to capture and detect targeted miRNAs and mRNAs in human plasma without any need of pre- or post-sample treatment. We have successfully demonstrated the ability to assess both exosomal miRNAs and mRNAs using both Next Generation Sequencing and our tCLN biochip in cohorts of control smokers and patients with early stage NSCLC. Our primary objectives are to extend these novel findings by (1) Test and validate the utility of measurement of ASCL1 and DLL3 in the early detection of SCLC in a retrospective and prospective study with network samples (2) Develop A Panel of Comprehensive EV RNA Candidates using nest generation sequencing and q-RT-PCR (3) Develop an optimized EV nanochip based RNA Classifier for early SCLC detection and (4) Validate the optimized EV RNA Classifier by using the multiplex TLN array biochips in independent, blinded case control studies at the OSU James Cancer Hospital and from the SCLC consortium.",2017-03-20T12:03:00Z,2023-02-28T12:02:00Z,PAR-16-051,nofo_PAR-16-051,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,RICHMOND,VA,UNITED STATES,sclc
U01CA213333,Targeting the transcriptional and epigenetic landscape in chemo-refractory Small-Cell Lung Cancer,"Summary Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is characterized by aggressive growth, genomic heterogeneity, and rapid development of resistance to chemotherapy. SCLC patients frequently demonstrate initial clinical response to chemotherapy, including the clinical standard of care cisplatin-etoposide regimen, but eventually succumb to chemo-refractory disease. Recent sequencing studies have demonstrated that SCLC is one of the most highly mutated cancers, but these efforts have yet to identify targetable `driver' mutations in both chemo-sensitive and chemo-refractory disease. Using an unbiased, high-throughput cellular screen of a diverse chemical library, we have identified that SCLC chemo-sensitive and chemo-refractory tumor cells are highly sensitive to inhibitors of the general transcription apparatus. In particular, we observed that SCLC tumor cells were highly sensitive to THZ1, a newly identified covalent inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) that functions as a co-factor for RNA polymerase II (Pol II). We found that this transcriptional vulnerability is conferred, in part, by the exquisite sensitivity of key super-enhancer (SE) -driven SCLC oncogenes to transcriptional inhibition. We therefore hypothesize that the inhibition of other transcriptional CDKs found at SEs and their associated genes could provide additional therapeutic avenues. For this purpose we have developed structure-inspired approaches for the design of covalent inhibitors targeting various transcriptional CDKs. We further hypothesize that comparative analysis of enhancer landscapes and gene expression profiles from chemo-naïve and chemo- refractory primary tumors will 1) identify transcriptional and epigenetic features specific to chemo-refractory disease, 2) enable grouping into clinically relevant subtypes, and 3) identify transcriptional and epigenetic dependencies specific to chemo-refractory disease that can be `drugged' using transcriptional CDK inhibitors. As changes to tumor oncogene expression and chemo-resistance have been shown to impact the immune compartment, we anticipate that chemo-refractory tumors will also exhibit changes in immune cell activation and infiltration. By extending our classification of clinical subtypes to the tumor microenvironment, we hope to find both tumor and immune cell gene expression programs that amenable to small molecule targeting with the goal of enhancing tumor immune surveillance capabilities. Lastly, as many transcription CDKs are known to transcriptionally regulate key pathways that modulate the response to DNA-damaging agents and immunotherapies we will investigate whether transcriptional CDK inhibitors may also be combined with other investigational SCLC therapies.",2017-06-09T12:06:00Z,2022-05-31T12:05:00Z,PAR-16-049,nofo_PAR-16-049,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,NEW YORK,NY,UNITED STATES,sclc
U01CA213338,Developing ASCL1 and NeuroD1 lineage oncogene targeted therapy for small cell lung cancer,"Developing ASCL1 and NEUROD1 lineage oncogene targeted therapy for small cell lung cancer (SCLC) This application focuses on developing new targeted therapy for SCLC focusing on two key lineage oncogenes involved in SCLC pathogenesis and malignant behavior, ASCL1 and NEUROD1. Nearly 90% of SCLCs express ASCL1, NEUROD1 or both. In the preclinical models, including human SCLC lines and xenografts and genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) of SCLC, tumors that express either ASCL1 or NEUROD1 appear “addicted” to their expression and function. The presence of ASCL1 or NEUROD1 also are associated with expression of important downstream oncogenes and regulatory genes. If ASCL1/NEUROD1 are removed (through genetic knockdown) SCLCs undergo many logs of tumor cell kill. Using state of the art technology in human preclinical models, we propose to systematically study the dependency of a large number of SCLC lines and xenografts (including patient derived xenografts, PDXs, and circulating tumor cell derived xenografts, CDXs) on ASCL1 and NEUROD1 through genetic knockdown, and systematically test the ability of blocking genetically and pharmacologically downstream potentially “druggable” targets of these two transcription factors to kill SCLCs. We have three specific aims: Aim 1. Determine ASCL1 and NEUROD1 expression patterns and clinical and molecular correlates in preclinical SCLC models and tumor specimens; Aim 2. Determine ASCL1 and NEUROD1 genetic dependency phenotypes, potential molecular biomarkers predicting response, and frequency and mechanisms of resistance in SCLC preclinical models; Aim 3. Determine the role of ASCL1 and NEUROD1 directly regulated “downstream” targets as vulnerabilities that can be exploited for therapeutic effect using in vivo xenograft shRNA mini-library “drop out” screens and selected drugs that inhibit downstream “druggable” targets. As part of these aims we will also determine if resistance to ASCL1 or NEUROD1 targeted therapy in SCLCs develops using CRISPR-CAS9 technology including potential mechanisms of this resistance, and we will explore the possible use of ASCL1 and NEUROD1 expression as SCLC enrollment biomarkers for developing “precision medicine” to predict the response of such targeted therapy in individual SCLCs. We have developed a large amount of preliminary data on which this application is based including 1) assembling the world’s largest collection of clinically and molecularly annotated human SCLC lines and xenografts, as well as important GEMMs of SCLC, 2) generating a comprehensive list of directly regulated downstream targets of ASCL1 and NEUROD1 through ChipSeq/RNASeq and chromatin landscape studies, and 3) developing experimental approaches to systematically study the dependency of SCLCs on ASCL1 and NEUORD1 downstream targets. We have assembled a world class team of investigators, including a patient advocate, with complementary skills to assure the successful completion of this project. The final deliverables will serve as the basis for new ASCL1 and NEUROD1 targeted therapeutics for SCLC.",2017-09-25T12:09:00Z,2022-08-31T12:08:00Z,PAR-16-049,nofo_PAR-16-049,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,DALLAS,TX,UNITED STATES,sclc
U01CA213359,Clinical development of a DLL3-targeted theranostic for small cell lung cancer,"PROJECT SUMMARY Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is remarkable for exceptionally high metastatic potential, initial robust response to DNA damaging agents, and near universal development of resistance. This combination of predilection for early metastasis acquired treatment resistance – often times manifested as cross resistance to multiple agents – highlights a critical need for novel systemic therapies operating through a novel mechanism in order to achieve improved patient outcomes. Delta-like ligand 3 (DLL3), has recently been identified as a therapeutic target in SCLC. The highly tumor-selective surface expression of this protein make it an excellent candidate target for an antibody drug conjugate (ADC). Rovalpituzumab tesserine (Rova-T) is one such ADC that is showing encouraging efficacy signals in the clinic. However, despite apparent clinical benefit, this agent has also been associated with some severe adverse events attributable to the presence of the anthracycline PBD warhead. DLL3 targeting approaches are in need of both a real-time, quantitative diagnostic biomarker and a therapeutic approach with reduced toxicity. We propose a theranostic approach comprising on 89Zr immunoPET and a 90Y/177Lu radioimmunotherapeutic. The first Aim improves upon already promising bioconjugation chemistry. We are already able to obtain high-contrast immunoPET images using non-specific amine labeling and site-specific maleimide bioconjugation. We will improve upon this approach by developing more stable thiol-clickable methylsuflone chelators for 89Zr and 90Y/177Lu to minimize kidney dose. The second Aim identifies preclinical dosing parameters and comprehensively optimizes efficacy and toxicity in a traditional cell line xenograft. Our preliminary imaging data is focused on H82, an SCLC cell lined derived from a chemoexperienced patient. This cell line is very resistant to etoposide in vitro and in vivo and will be used to identify a radiotherapy dose that demonstrates efficacy in vivo, while minimizing dose to the kidney. Different dose ranges and schedules will be explored. The final Aim explores radiotherapy in a variety of in vivo contexts including lesion sizes ranging from 0.1 to 10 mm in diameter and representing both chemonaïve and chemoresistant disease. Radioisotopes have different energy deposition depending on the volume of the tumor being targeted. We will evaluate 90Y and 177Lu radioisotopes in different in vivo models of small cell lung cancer for the ability to eradicate lesions of different sizes. A unique resource in the lab is our collection of 10 paired chemonaïve and chemoresistant patient-derived xenograft lines. We will place particular emphasis on establishing efficacy in the context of acquired chemoresistance. Data obtained in this study should provide preclinical evidence in support of clinical translation of a DLL3 targeting theranostic based on rovalpituzumab.",2017-02-15T12:02:00Z,2023-01-31T12:01:00Z,PAR-16-049,nofo_PAR-16-049,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,NEW YORK,NY,UNITED STATES,sclc
U01CA214165,Ultrasensitive Detection of Tumor Specific DNA Methylation Changes for the Early Detection of Lung Cancer ,"TITLE Ultrasensitive Detection of Tumor Specific DNA Methylation Changes for the Early Detection of Lung Cancer ABSTRACT This proposal seeks to improve upon the management of lung cancer through detection of tumor specific abnormal DNA methylation. Despite highly publicized advances in genomics and proteomics, the promise of non-invasive diagnostics and personalized medicine remains largely unrealized. Recently, comprehensive determination of genetic and epigenetic aberrations has become a major activity in cancer research since it is well understood that these aberrations provide clues to the process of tumorigenesis. The applicants have developed extremely sensitive assays for the detection of hypermethylated DNA sequences. They have also optimized the isolation and processing of circulating cell free DNA from tumors for these sensitive methods. The comprehensive genome wide analysis of molecular changes in cancer completed by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) has been used to identify many highly frequent cancer specific methylation events in lung cancer that will be combined with an integrated approach to sample processing and preparation and novel sensitive detection strategies to provide utrasensitive detection of tumor specific changes in DNA methylation in blood and sputum samples. With a large population based screening cohort, the Pittsburgh Lung Screening Study, they will develop and characterize the performance of sensitive methods for detecting cancer specific changes in DNA methylation. This molecular detection will compliment CT screening to address the important issue of early detection of lung cancer.",2016-09-15T12:09:00Z,2023-03-31T12:03:00Z,RFA-CA-16-009,nofo_CA-16-009,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,PITTSBURGH,PA,UNITED STATES,edrn
U01CA214170,Discovery and qualification of transcriptomic biomarkers for the early detection of aggressive prostate cancer,"Project Summary This application proposes the formation of a University of Michigan (UM) EDRN Biomarker Development Lab (BDL). Through previous EDRN BDLs, our team has characterized multiple important prostate cancer biomarkers, most notably TMPRSS2-ETS gene fusions. Through collaboration with an EDRN Clinical Validation Center (CVC; Dr. Sanda PI), we have developed, validated and clinically implemented Mi-Prostate Score (MiPS), a prostate cancer early detection test incorporating urine quantification of two prostate cancer specific transcripts—the TMPRSS2:ERG gene fusion and PCA3—with serum PSA. Introduced in our CLIA laboratory (and now with New York State approval), MiPS helps shared decision making after PSA testing based on individualized risk predictions of aggressive prostate cancer on biopsy. Here, using this work as a model, we will discover and characterize aggressive prostate cancer transcriptomic biomarkers, focusing on long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). Although lncRNA biomarker utility has been largely unexplored, we recently characterized the lncRNA compendium (“MiTranscriptome”), identifying several prostate cancer-specific and aggressive prostate cancer-specific lncRNAs. Supporting our proposed approach, we have performed initial validation of the lncRNA SChLAP1 as an aggressive prostate cancer specific biomarker in tissues. Likewise, we have developed RT-PCR based next generation sequencing (NGS) panels capable of quantifying multiplexed transcriptomic biomarkers in archived tissue and urine. Here, in three Aims, we will nominate and develop transcriptomic biomarkers as predictors of aggressive prostate cancer both at and prior to diagnosis. In Aim 1, we will identify novel aggressive prostate cancer-associated transcriptomic alterations from our MiTranscriptome analysis. We will develop single gene and multiplexed NGS assays to study these lncRNAs/coding transcripts as aggressive prostate cancers specific biomarkers. In Aim 2 we will characterize transcripts from Aim 1 as tissue based aggressive prostate cancer biomarkers. Following our previous approach with SChLAP1, we will develop individual in situ hybridization assays and a multiplexed NGS panel to characterize these transcripts in well characterized prostate cancer tissue cohorts. In Aim 3, we will characterize transcripts identified in Aim 1 as non-invasive, urine-based aggressive prostate cancer early detection biomarkers. Through collaboration with Hologic/Gen-Probe (our industry partner on MiPS), we will develop and assesses the performance of individual prioritized biomarkers using their platform on our biobanked urine samples. Additionally, using multiplexed NGS, we will also characterize the performance of a panel of transcriptomic biomarkers as an alternative/complementary approach. As recognized by the EDRN, novel aggressive prostate cancer specific biomarkers are urgently needed. Importantly, our approach extends beyond prostate cancer and our BDL, and our group has actively participated in the EDRN biomarker community and anticipates continuing work with other BDLs and CVCs to facilitate the overall EDRN mission.",2016-09-15T12:09:00Z,2022-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-16-009,nofo_CA-16-009,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,ANN ARBOR,MI,UNITED STATES,edrn
U01CA214172,A unique approach combining avatar mice and targeted mass spectrometry to identify blood biomarkers for early detection of breast cancer,"Project Summary/Abstract Tens of millions of women undergo population-based screening for breast cancer by mammography. De- spite the life-saving potential of early detection, screening guidelines for mammography are controversial and continue to evolve. At issue are the specificity of mammography for distinguishing benign vs cancerous le- sions, the sensitivity of mammography in some patient populations (e.g. women with dense breasts), and con- cerns regarding over-diagnosis (e.g. some ductal carcinoma in situ). Our ultimate clinical aim is to develop a blood test for early detection of breast cancer that can be used in conjunction with mammography to improve sensitivity and specificity during screening, and thus have enormous clinical impact by detecting treatable can- cers missed by mammography (reducing mortality) and by avoiding unnecessary invasive procedures for be- nign or non-life-threatening disease. Despite considerable effort, attempts to identify blood-based screening biomarkers for early detection of breast cancer have failed, due to technological and methodological limitations. Clearly new approaches are warranted. We are proposing a completely novel strategy, based on the initial discovery of candidate bi- omarkers in the plasma of “avatar mice” (harboring early passage human breast cancer xenografts), and fol- lowed by biomarker triage and validation using a novel biomarker pipeline based on a targeted form of mass spectrometry (MS), multiple reaction monitoring (MRM). If successful, this study could provide a road map for applying this general approach to other cancer sites, beyond breast cancer. Briefly, candidate circulating biomarkers identified in the avatar mouse plasma will be verified in the plasma from the human patients and prioritized for further testing based on integrative proteo-genomic analyses using large breast cancer datasets generated by NCI genomic and proteomic consortia (TCGA and CPTAC). A nov- el, multiplex MRM-based assay will be developed and analytically validated (according to established fit-for- purpose guidelines) to quantify up to 50-100 prioritized biomarker candidates. Candidate biomarkers will be evaluated in an existing, strongly unbiased collection of plasma samples in which plasmas were collected prior to biopsy, compliant with PRoBE study design criteria, under an SOP from women with undiagnosed mammo- graphic lesions. Performance of the candidate biomarkers will initially be assessed in a training set (100 cas- es, 100 controls) to verify which candidates show a mean difference in plasma levels between cases vs con- trols, and to test the possibility of building a multiple marker prediction model. Subsequently, individual candi- date biomarkers (as well as a potential multiple marker prediction model) will be assessed in an independent validation set (150 cases, 150 controls) to estimate the sensitivity and specificity of the markers/panel.",2016-09-19T12:09:00Z,2023-03-31T12:03:00Z,RFA-CA-16-009,nofo_CA-16-009,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,SEATTLE,WA,UNITED STATES,edrn
U01CA214182,The Boston University-UCLA Lung Cancer Biomarker Development Lab,"ABSTRACT With the increasing adoption of computed tomography (CT) as a screening tool for lung cancer, methods for identifying the small number of patients with malignant nodules from among the large number of patients with benign CT-detected nodules is a growing and urgent clinical need. We have targeted the problem of developing biomarkers for detecting malignant solid or part-solid nodules that are 6 – 25 mm in diameter that are identified by screening at risk individuals or found incidentally in screen-eligible individuals. The ability to sensitively detect lung cancer in this clinical setting could reduce many of the potentially harmful consequences that currently arise from uncertainties about which of these indeterminate lung nodules require the most aggressive workup. The core of our approach is the integration of molecular biomarkers measured in non-invasively collected nasal brushes and plasma specimens together with complementary imaging and clinical markers. On the basis of our preliminary data, we will use total RNA sequencing of both large and small RNA to deeply characterize the cancer-associated airway-wide field of injury in nasal epithelium; exosome-derived plasma miRNA to capture information about tumor-associated products found in the circulation; and qualitative and quantitative imaging characteristics to capture information about the biology of the nodule and the local environment that would otherwise only be available through direct sampling. Further, we will be profiling these features in several unique cohorts of smokers with indeterminate nodules detected either incidentally or by screening that represent the clinical population in which most lung cancers are diagnosed. Our use of biorepositories that have been collected from the clinical settings in which the biomarker would ultimately be applied, utilizing a prospective-specimen-collection, retrospective-blinded- evaluation (PRoBE) design minimizes potential bias and improves applicability to the intended use population. A key aspect of our biomarker development plan is a two-staged feature selection process that will allow us to efficiently use patient cohorts to detect robustly cancer-associated molecular and imaging features that will then be used to construct integrated cancer predictive models. The performance and clinical utility of the resulting models will undergo preliminary validation studies at the end of the proposed studies. This will allow us to make a GO / NO-GO decision about whether they should be subsequently tested in larger validation trials based on a rigorous evaluation of their validity and also whether they represent progress toward our goal of shrinking the intermediate risk category, thereby improving the diagnostic workup of the large number of patients for whom there is currently considerable clinical uncertainty.",2016-09-20T12:09:00Z,2022-09-30T12:09:00Z,RFA-CA-16-009,nofo_CA-16-009,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,BOSTON,MA,UNITED STATES,edrn
U01CA214183,Breast Cancer Detection Consortium,"Abstract Mammography is an early detection modality for breast cancer that is implemented widely in the United States, has established benchmarks of performance, and in most studies throughout the world has been demonstrated to reduce mortality due to the disease. This relatively inexpensive x-ray imaging of the breast also provides a location that can be directly sampled through needle biopsy which leads generally to an unambiguous pathologic diagnosis of invasive cancer, carcinoma in situ, or benign findings. No system is perfect and mammographic screening, particularly in the US, prompts over 1.6 million biopsies per year detecting approximately 230,000 invasive and 60,000 non-invasive cancers for a positive predictive value of less than 20%. There may be substantial room to improve on this and reduce the number of biopsies but this improvement must not sacrifice detection rates so the negative predictive value (NPV, identification of true negatives) must remain very high. In this Biomarker Development Laboratory application, we propose to test whether a combination of mammographic feature analysis and candidate biomarkers that we have identified can achieve an NPV that would be acceptable to patients and providers to prevent unnecessary breast biopsies. One of the biomarkers is a type of circulating giant cell termed “Cancer Associated Macrophage Like” (CAML) that can only be detected using freshly drawn whole blood, we propose to conduct a prospective trial at Duke University in women undergoing breast cancer diagnosis. Our realistic goal is to accrue ~1000 women over the course of 4 years for which full field digital mammography has been performed. The images will undergo feature extraction for decision modeling. Blood will be analyzed for the presence and type of CAML cells, immunosignaturing using the high density peptide arrays developed by Stephen Johnston at Arizona State, and measurements of two specific analytes that have the highest sensitivity and specificity for basal type cancers, CA125 and TP53 autoantibodies. As feature analysis from imaging alone can achieve, at least for masses on mammography, an AUC of ~0.9, the study is designed to determine whether the biomarkers have sufficient complementary information to the imaging and each other to increase the AUC to 0.95 allowing us to identify a threshold where there is a 98% NPV. We will make use of the most careful and consistent standard operating procedures, the best candidate biomarkers, and the most well developed imaging algorithms to make this a definitive study.",2016-09-19T12:09:00Z,2023-03-31T12:03:00Z,RFA-CA-16-009,nofo_CA-16-009,DUKE UNIVERSITY,DURHAM,NC,UNITED STATES,edrn
U01CA214194,Development of Protein Biomarkers in Post-DRE Urine for use in Liquid Biopsy of Prostate Cancer,"Prostate cancer (PCa) remains the most common non-skin malignancy afflicting men in the United states. It is the second leading cause of cancer-related death. The clinical diversity of PCa is dramatic, ranging from asymptomatic disease to metastatic and fatal malignancy. One cause of this clinical diversity is the remarkable intra- and inter-tumoural heterogeneity in disease genomics. As a result, currently clinically-used risk-stratification strategies do not robustly discriminate aggressive from indolent diseases, leading to systemic over- and under- treatment. Approximately 40% of men diagnosed with PCa who seek curative treatment undergo surgical removal of their prostate (radical prostatectomy, RP). Of these, approximately 30% are found at surgery to have disease outside their prostate (non-organ-confined, non-OC). These men are candidates for multi-modal adjuvant treatment with chemo- and hormone- therapy to improve outcomes. We therefore propose to tackle this problem, using fluid biomarkers to circumvent the molecular heterogeneity of the disease. Our proposal leverages an active and productive multi-investigator, multi-institutional proteomic collaboration to develop biomarkers for the early detection of locally aggressive non-organ-confined disease. Our two lead biomarkers are 1) A multiple peptide panel that discriminates OC from non-OC in EDRN phase 2 equivalent validation (Nature Communications, in press). 2) Surface expression of CUB Domain Containing Protein 1 on exosomes differentiates PCa aggressiveness (EDRN Phase 1 equivalent discovery, Oncotarget, 2016). We propose both validation of these targets in a globally-unique biobank of expressed prostatic secretions, as well as novel biomarker discovery/development strategies to extend them in the same clinical context and sample matrix. Successful completion of our proposed studies will result in validation of at least two biomarkers for clinical utility in separation of OC vs. non-OC disease, helping to personalize therapy for a tumour type that afflicts 1 in 7 North American men.",2016-09-15T12:09:00Z,2022-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-16-009,nofo_CA-16-009,EASTERN VIRGINIA MEDICAL SCHOOL,NORFOLK,VA,UNITED STATES,edrn
U01CA214195,The EDRN Mesothelioma Biomarker Discovery Laboratory,"The asbestos-related malignancy, malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM), is often detected in late stages with little chance for survival. Biomarkers are needed to (1)determine which patients have been asbestos exposed (AE) (2) distinguish AE and non-MPM malignancies from MPM patients and (3) determine which MPM patients are at highest risk for early recurrence or death. The EDRN Mesothelioma Biomarker Discovery Laboratory will refine and validate three novel MPM blood/effusion based markers (FBLN3, SOMAmer 13 classifier, HMGB1 Isoforms) and investigate whether immune- oncologic gene expression differences in the cellular component of the circulating blood microenvironment can stratify AE and MPM from other control cohorts. All of these in Phase I/II discovery studies have yielded AUCs > 0.9. An in-house, novel Luminex based assay (Soma 14 NYU MPM) consisting of 13 slow-off-rate-modified-aptamers (SOMAmers) and a newly constructed FBLN3 SOMAmer will be assembled and technically validated using identical specimens that were used to discover these 14 analytes. Diagnostic and prognostic capabilities in both plasma and pleural effusion will be performed with healthy, non-AE exposed, AE, MPM, and non- MPM cancer cohorts, followed by a blinded validation in specimens provided by the Princess Margaret Cancer Center. The University of Hawaii/Cedar Sinai Medical Center, using 202 NYU pleural effusions, will evaluate a unique, technically validated, electrospray ionization liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry assay for HMGB1 and its isoforms to differentiate MPM from non-MPM benign and malignant effusions. The HMGB1 effusion results will be compared to those obtained with the Soma 14 NYU MPM using validation cohorts from an approved EDRN MPM screening program in Santiago, Chile and South Glasgow University Hospital. Finally we will refine and validate our buffy coat/PBMC MPM profile of 5 immuno- oncology genes which in Phase II studies can separate non AE individuals vs AE individuals vs MPM with AUCs of 1.0. These studies could lead to 3 novel platforms which individually or combined could significantly improve chances for early diagnosis and accurate prognostication of patients with MPM.",2016-09-20T12:09:00Z,2023-01-23T12:01:00Z,RFA-CA-16-009,nofo_CA-16-009,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,NEW YORK,NY,UNITED STATES,edrn
U01CA214201,Novel approaches to study immune responses to post translational modifications for cancer detection,"Project Summary/Abstract Despite advances in screening and treatment, mortalities from breast and lung cancers have remained high in the US over the last 20 years. It is widely accepted that early detection is critical to improving outcomes in both diseases. Both also rely on imaging for screening, but false positive and false negative detection are associated with unnecessary biopsies, missed diagnoses, and costs. There is an urgent need for biochemical markers that improve the performance of imaging technologies. Our laboratories have been successful at identifying useful cancer biomarkers by exploiting patients’ own ability to produce antibodies against tumor- associated antigens (TAA), referred to as tumor-associated autoantibodies (TAAb). With prior EDRN support, we developed high-throughput programmable protein display methods for the rapid detection and validation of autoantibody biomarker signatures in breast and lung cancers. Our breast cancer TAAb biomarkers have been licensed and integrated into Videssa™ Breast that is now available as CLIA-certified test. Our triple negative breast cancer markers have been validated in blinded phase 2 multicenter validation studies. These demonstrate the great utility of TAAb in cancer early detection. However, the sensitivities of most TAAbs is moderate and there is a suggestion that greater sensitivity and specificity could be obtained by examining TAAb directed at aberrantly modified proteins in cancers. Our central hypothesis is that aberrant protein glycosylation, a hallmark of breast and lung cancers, induces glycoprotein-specific TAAb that can be measured as specific serum biomarkers of these cancers. Alterations in glycosylation are highly immunogenic, and there is strong historical evidence for significant antibody responses to cancer-altered glycoproteins. However, all current protein (or polypeptide) display tools allow limited or no post-translational modification. This historical roadblock has prevented the identification of these biomarkers because of the lack of screening methods that test immunogenic structural glycoproteins. We introduce a tool for the high-throughput display of full-length proteins decorated with cancer-specific O-glycan structures. This will revolutionize the opportunity to screen glycan-protein epitopes in their natural context. Our team comprises strong expertise in functional proteomics, biomarker development, glycoproteomics, medical oncology and biostatistics. Targeted proteins will include: the extra-cellular domains of relevant single pass membrane proteins, proteins known to be O-glycosylated and overexpressed in the two cancers, and all known mucins. They will be translated in situ using human ribosomes and chaperone proteins and then systematically decorated with Tn and STn O-GalNAc-type glycans by consecutive addition of recombinant glycosyltransferases and sugar nucleotides to mirror what occurs in the two cancers. Adhering to the principles of PRoBE design, we will screen these arrays with cancer patient and control sera. Our study will focus on cancer patients and non-cancer subjects with positive imaging findings. Study design will include Phase I discovery (arrays/ELISA) and Phase II validation using ELISA.",2016-09-21T12:09:00Z,2022-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-16-009,nofo_CA-16-009,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY-TEMPE CAMPUS,TEMPE,AZ,UNITED STATES,edrn
U01CA214846,Accelerating Cancer Genomics with Cloud-scale Bioconductor,"PROJECT SUMMARY The Bioconductor project is rooted in recognition that efﬁcient, rigorous, and reproducible analysis of high- dimensional data can be achieved when statisticians, biologists, and computer scientists federate efforts in a transparent and carefully engineered way. The project Accelerating Cancer Genomics with Cloud-scale Bio- conductor devises new approaches to carrying out genome-scale analysis of cancer data using cloud computing environments. The proposal is based on strategies that have proven highly effective in ﬁfteen years of supporting collaborative and carefully engineered software for genome scale analysis in computational biology in the Biocon- ductor project, based on the highly portable and widely adopted R language and environment for data analysis. In Aim 1 we develop architecture and infrastructure for scalably harvesting cloud-based representations of large- scale cancer genome studies such as The Cancer Genome Atlas, creating formal high-performance workﬂows for processing and interpreting cancer genome analyses, and providing packaging and data distribution schemes for moving data to the cloud for scalable analysis there. In Aim 2 we create and support independent creation of intuitive and cancer-relevant interface components supporting reproducible interactive exploration and analysis using the facilities of Rstudio. In Aim 3 we update and generalize the Bioconductor MLInterfaces metapackage to support advanced machine learning using the cancer-oriented strategies and facilities devised in Aims 1 and 2. Our proposal will beneﬁt large numbers of cancer researchers who will be taking advantage of cloud resources, probably with R close to hand, by marrying strengths of cloud-centric strategies for data archiving and query resolution, to the strengths of Bioconductor development and analysis capabilities. We have letters of support from the leadership of the three NCI Cancer Cloud Pilot projects for this project.",2017-05-01T12:05:00Z,2021-04-30T12:04:00Z,PAR-15-332,nofo_PAR-15-332,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,BOSTON,MA,UNITED STATES,itcr
U01CA215010,Integration of comprehensive cancer mutation and expression-associated data for biomarker evaluation and discovery,"ABSTRACT Current technologies for cancer genomics research generate petabytes of data that are dispersed across multiple archives in a non-standard fashion. This dispersal poses major challenges to comprehensive analyses based on the integration of such data. Two common types of secondary data generated from sequencing- based studies involve mutation and gene expression associated with the cancer state as inferred from comparing matched tumor and normal samples. Massive collaborations like the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the International Cancer Genomic Consortium (ICGC) are instrumental in facilitating the generation of the sequence data and providing a modicum of standardization through best practices, but they do not always follow the same standards between projects. Moreover, proprietary databases like the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) generally store and annotate data in a format uniquely optimized for their own database to meet individual business needs. Thus, integrating mutation and expression data across resources involves a massive undertaking with efforts devoted to data curation, unification, harmonization, and appropriate annotation for proper representation at a central location. Additionally, it is difficult to comprehensively collect and map protein functional sites to the mutation sites from a variety of databases such as UniProt, RefSeq, and many others because the underlying sequences in these databases can be different. To address this challenge, the Early Detection Research Network (EDRN) Associate Membership funded the development of BioMuta and BioXpress, cancer-associated mutation and expression databases, respectively, to provide access to unified data from several popular cancer repositories and functional data from well-known molecular biology resources. Links to BioMuta are available through the EDRN portal and UniProt. The focus of the proposed project is to provide a custom portal encompassing up-to-date releases of BioMuta and BioXpress leveraging the existing EDRN framework and data. This will provide a broader understanding of the cancer landscape moving toward the proteomic space and working synergistically with other ITCR resources. To supplement these data, we further propose to integrate normal expression data across several species that can be used to derive a deeper understanding of the cancer-associated expression profiles. Text-mining support will also be applied to the identified cancer-related mutation and expression profiles for evidence to aid in interpretation of the findings. It is expected that such large-scale integration of cancer data and supporting information will not only benefit cancer research, but will also become a critical necessity for ensuring the most efficient synthesis of information and therefore the earliest detection methods possible.",2017-05-01T12:05:00Z,2021-04-30T12:04:00Z,PAR-15-332,nofo_PAR-15-332,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,WASHINGTON,DC,UNITED STATES,itcr
U01CA215709,Precision lung cancer therapy design through multiplexed adapter measurement,"Project Summary Combination therapy holds considerable promise for overcoming intrinsic and acquired resistance to targeted therapies but will rely on our ability to precisely identify the best drug combination for particular tumors. While immense focus exists on using genomic information to direct therapeutic approach, many resistance mechanisms do not rely on genetic changes and, in fact, can arise from entirely tumor-extrinsic factors within the microenvironment. For example, though the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) AXL is widely implicated in resistance to targeted therapies such as those directed against EGFR, its regulation by phosphatidylserine, as opposed to mutation, amplification or autocrine ligand, make identifying the tumors that will respond to AXL- targeted therapy especially challenging. We propose to study both downstream and receptor-proximal signaling during bypass resistance mediated by AXL, and then across a wider panel of RTKs. Integrating these measurements with quantitative modeling will identify the connectivity between receptors, interacting adapters, and downstream signaling events, thereby defining the essential set of signaling network changes required for tumor cell survival in response to targeted therapeutics. We will then apply this understanding by measuring RTK-adapter interaction using proximity ligation to predict the RTKs driving bypass resistance and test these predictions in a panel of patient-derived xenograft tumors. This work will considerably improve our ability to identify effective drug combinations by (a) developing a mechanism-based assay for identifying which among many RTKs tumor cells are relying upon for survival, (b) improving our basic understanding of exactly how network-level bypass resistance arises due to activation of non-targeted RTKs both at the receptor-proximal and downstream signaling layer, and (c) expanding our understanding of the RTK AXL with links to resistance, tumor spread, and immune avoidance.",2017-09-25T12:09:00Z,2023-08-31T12:08:00Z,PAR-16-131,nofo_PAR-16-131,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,LOS ANGELES,CA,UNITED STATES,csbc
U01CA215794,An Integrated Systems Approach for Incompletely Penetrant Onco-phenotypes.,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Perturbation of cancer cells often leads to heterogeneous outcomes, in that most cells exhibit a dominant phenotype, but the rest appear resistant or hypersensitive to the perturbation. If the penetrance of such a phenotype is heritably incomplete, then it becomes extremely difficult to decipher the upstream molecular events that heterogenize the population and cause response variability. By combining quantitative measurements with dynamical models, systems approaches should be useful if provided with a core network of important biomolecules. The daunting hurdle lies in identifying phenotype-relevant regulatory heterogeneities that define the network for penetrance at the single-cell level. Our proposal seeks to exploit a new approach, called stochastic frequency matching (SFM), for elaborating the molecular networks upstream of incompletely penetrant phenotypes. SFM identifies and parameterizes single-cell heterogeneities—which emerge after a uniform perturbation but before the appearance of a variable phenotype—to hone in on regulatory states corresponding to future penetrance. For an onco-phenotype incompletely triggered by ErbB receptor tyrosine kinase signaling in 3D cultured breast epithelia, we implemented SFM using microarrays to uncover a network of critical nucleocytoplasmic regulators. The goals of this proposal are to apply systems approaches to the ErbB nucleocytoplasmic network and adapt SFM more broadly to RNA sequencing of breast cancer patients with ErbB amplification. Based on our provisional SFM results, we hypothesize that ErbB signaling heterogeneously reconfigures the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling state of cells to determine incomplete penetrance of the onco-phenotype. The aims are to: 1) Identify network-level mechanisms for the incompletely penetrant ErbB1:ErbB2 phenotype. 2) Determine whether drivers of incomplete penetrance in 3D define shuttling states in human cancers and promote ErbB2-driven mammary tumors in mice. 3) Sequence and parameterize regulatory-state heterogeneity in HER2+ breast cancers to assemble patient-specific network models of shuttling variability and sensitivity. Drivers of incomplete penetrance are important for understanding transitions during tumor initiation-progression and for developing therapeutic interventions with more reliable patient outcomes. SFM gives the Cancer Systems Biology Consortium a means to identify driver networks in a comprehensive and hypothesis-driven way.",2017-09-15T12:09:00Z,2022-07-31T12:07:00Z,PAR-16-131,nofo_PAR-16-131,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,CHARLOTTESVILLE,VA,UNITED STATES,csbc
U01CA215798,"Systems approaches to understanding the relationships between genotype, signaling, and therapeutic efficacy","Project Summary/Abstract The promise of precision medicine is that a physician can tailor a therapeutic regimen to suit each individual patient. In the case of cancer, this means a personalized therapeutic strategy based on the molecular features of an individual's cancer. But while successes in precision medicine have garnered significant attention in recent years, precision medicine has not made an impact for the vast majority of cancer patients. Our overarching goal is to use proteomics and systems biology to understand the relationships between cancer genotype and therapeutic response, with the long-term goal of expanding the prospects of precision medicine. Our study focuses primary on cancers expressing mutant forms of K-Ras, the most commonly mutated oncoprotein in cancer and one of the best biomarkers for the failure of a cancer to respond to therapy. Using a variety of experimental and computational approaches, this project will address three key questions related to K-Ras and the promise of precision medicine. First, we will exploit a relatively rare circumstance in which colorectal cancers expressing a specific mutant form of K-Ras are uniquely sensitive to inhibition of the MEK kinase. We will use mass spectrometry and computational modeling to determine why cancers expressing K-RasG12D and K-RasA146T are differentially sensitive to inhibition of MEK. Next, we will address the limitation of univariate genetic prediction of therapeutic efficacy by determining how genetic and epigenetic factors interact to establish network signaling state. We will use mass cytometry and computational modeling to explore how signaling downstream of mutant K-Ras is affected by cellular lineage and by secondary mutations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. Finally, we will move beyond genotype as a predictor of therapeutic efficacy by developing an algorithm to predict sensitivity to kinase inhibition based on phospho-proteomic measurements. We will validate the computational approach via preclinical therapeutics studies in patient-derived xenografts. Altogether these studies will utilize state-of-the-art experimental and computational approaches to make personalized medicine a realistic goal for patients suffering from K-Ras mutant cancer.",2017-04-05T12:04:00Z,2022-03-31T12:03:00Z,PAR-16-131,nofo_PAR-16-131,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,CAMBRIDGE,MA,UNITED STATES,csbc
U01CA215845,Phenotype Transitions in Small Cell Lung Cancer,"Abstract Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer related deaths. In its most lethal form, small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), heterogeneity correlates with aggressiveness, however no driver mutations distinguishing SCLC subtypes have been identified. Another singularity of SCLC is that it responds well to initial treatment but quickly relapses into resistance, suggesting phenotypic plasticity. In this basic project, we will investigate the role of transcriptional and signaling mechanisms in promoting SCLC phenotypic heterogeneity and plastic state transitions, leading to aggressiveness and rapid relapse. Our preliminary results indicate that SCLC heterogeneity is more extensive than the canonical neuroendocrine (NE) and mesenchymal-like (ML) subtypes, and includes multiple hybrid states. Most significantly, we found that drug treatment results in phenotypic transitions toward the hybrid states, implicating them in resistance. Based on these data, our central hypothesis is that SCLC is a heterogeneous mix of NE, ML and hybrid phenotypic states and that, due to phenotypic plasticity, transitions between these states is a key mechanism of treatment evasion in SCLC. To test this hypothesis, we will combine computation and experiments to characterize the global landscape of phenotypes in SCLC, and define the impact of phenotypic transitions on resistance. In Aim1, we will identify a regulatory transcription factor (TF) network that controls the differentiation of SCLC cells into NE, ML, and hybrid phenotypic states; validate model predicted phenotypes and quantify their drug sensitivity; and, define reprogramming pathways to drug- sensitive states. Our approach pipeline is comprised of phenotypic clustering and gene co-expression network analysis on SCLC tumor and cell line data, simulations of logic-based TF network models to prioritize TF targets for reprogramming, and experimental validation of model predictions in vitro and in vivo. In Aim2, we will quantify phenotype sensitivity to chemotherapy and plasticity in response to signaling perturbations; identify perturbations that promote phenotype switching; and, test optimal drug/perturbagen combinations that maximize SCLC cell killing under treatment. Phenotypes and signaling pathways will be defined by flow and mass cytometry. SCLC clonal dynamics in response to perturbations will be quantified using a stochastic phenotype transition to prioritize drug/perturbagen combinations for experimental validation. Drug sensitivity and plasticity of SCLC phenotypes will be assessed with the drug-induced proliferation rate metric, which we recently described, and time series single-cell flow or mass cytometry. Success of this project will have translational impact by empowering searches for targeted therapies that reprogram drug-resistant cells toward drug-sensitive cells, which we anticipate will lead to significantly improved patient outcomes in SCLC. We further anticipate that this approach will be useful in other cancer types, opening the doors to a new paradigm of cancer treatment based on epigenetic tumor reprogramming.",2017-06-09T12:06:00Z,2023-05-31T12:05:00Z,PAR-16-131,nofo_PAR-16-131,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,Nashville,TN,UNITED STATES,csbc
U01CA215848,Model-based Prediction of Redox-Modulated Responses to Cancer Treatments,"Project Summary While the arsenal of approaches to selectively killing cancer cells is increasing, the majority of treatments rely on redox alterations of tumor cells and their microenvironment through chemotherapy, radiation, or some combination thereof. Effectively predicting response to these treatments remains a significant challenge in designing successful personalized therapeutic strategies and currently there are no biomarkers of response to chemo/radiation therapies in clinical use. We hypothesize that the response to redox-based chemotherapeutics can be predicted and enhanced by identifying specific metabolic network features contributing to the redox couple NAD(P)+/NAD(P)H and associated with the specific mechanism of action. We will integrate and expand the scope of our prior successful models of drug bioactivation networks and redox metabolic systems in a comprehensive systems-level approach to improve understanding and enhance prediction of phenotype-specific responses to chemotherapeutic strategies. We will investigate the NAD(P)H-driven mechanisms of response to the quinone-based chemotherapeutic, beta-lapachone (ß-lap), in laboratory models and clinical specimens of Head and Neck Squamous Cell Cancer (HNSCC). We propose to 1) Develop and validate a predictive model to quantify ß-lap lethality in matched HNSCC cell lines with altered redox metabolism and response to treatment (SCC-61/rSCC-61); 2) Enhance predictive capabilities of computational model by accounting for metabolic diversity across HNSCC tumors in vitro and in vivo; and, 3) Test model-based predictions of therapeutic outcomes with HNSCC clinical specimens. We anticipate our study will advance precision medicine by accounting for the redox-dependent mechanisms of action for molecular or systemic chemotherapies.",2017-09-04T12:09:00Z,2022-08-31T12:08:00Z,PAR-16-131,nofo_PAR-16-131,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,ATLANTA,GA,UNITED STATES,csbc
U01CA217842,Integrative bioinformatics and functional characterization of oncogenic driver aberrations in cancer,"Project Summary Large-scale national and international cancer sequencing programs are generating a compendium of tumor- associated genomic alterations to prioritize the most promising therapeutic targets for drug development. These efforts have uncovered a staggering level of genome complexity in cancer. Although much is known about the function and clinical impact of recurrent aberrations in well-known cancer genes, less is known about which and how the more abundant, low-frequency mutations contribute to tumor progression. Effective translation of tumor genomic datasets into cancer therapeutics will require new experimental systems to inform the functional activity of targets in the relevant biological context encompassing inter- and intra-tumoral heterogeneity. To address these needs, we propose a CTD2 Center that will provide the research community high-throughput informatic and experimental approaches to characterize and validate pathogenic “driver” mutations and fusion genes as well as identify molecular markers that meaningfully predict responses or resistance to anticancer therapies. We will pursue the following Specific Aims: In Aim 1 we will implement an algorithmic framework for identifying driver mutations with high sensitivity and specificity. We will focus our algorithm development, training and testing efforts on predicting oncogenic, gain-of-function mutation drivers of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). These computational approaches will be amenable to the analysis of all cancer types. We will next engineer ~1,500 selected mutations and ~400 fusion genes into expression vectors along with cohorts of personalized, patient-defined coding mutations. In Aim 2 we will enter mutant alleles and fusion genes into GBM, PDAC and EOC context-specific, in vivo functional screens that take into account the importance of genetic context, tumor microenvironment and heterogeneity in the selection of single and combinatorial drivers of tumorigenesis. In Aim 3 we will determine the consequences of intra-tumoral heterogeneity on tumor sensitivity and resistance to therapeutic agents using DNA-barcoded, human patient-derived xenograft models that recapitulate the heterogeneity of cancer. We will determine the extent to which single targeted agents and their rational combinations alter tumor population dynamics. We will also leverage Aim 1 informatics and functional characterizations in Aim 2 and 4 to characterize “persistor” populations to identify aberrations associated with drug resistance. In Aim 4 we will use high-throughput functional proteomics, innovative protein- protein interaction assays and informer drug library screening studies to elucidate underlying mechanisms and therapeutic liabilities engendered by validated drivers. The foundational platform implemented in our CTD2 Center will provide a validated pipeline for the rapid characterization of gain-of-function aberrations that can be industrialized across tumor lineages to guide clinical management of cancer patients.",2017-09-06T12:09:00Z,2023-07-31T12:07:00Z,RFA-CA-16-014,nofo_RFA-CA-16-014,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,PORTLAND,OR,UNITED STATES,ctd_2
U01CA217846,Pathway Discovery and Target Validation for Outgrowth of Breast Cancer Metastases,"PROJECT SUMMARY The overwhelming majority of deaths from cancer are attributable to metastasis, rather than growth of the primary tumor. In breast cancer, metastatic recurrence can occur years to decades after apparently successful surgery. Current methods do not allow individualized assessment of metastatic recurrence risk nor do they offer effective therapies for metastatic breast cancer patients. Breast cancer presents a unique research opportunity because the long interval between surgery and recurrence offers the potential to improve patient outcomes if effective anti-metastatic therapies could be developed. However, few drug discovery efforts to date have focused on the metastatic process specifically. The challenges we address are developing and applying methods to identify the basic mechanisms of metastasis, then prioritizing and validating genes and proteins as potential therapeutic targets. Our approach combines advances in experimental (Ewald) and computational (Bader) methods that we have developed to interrogate the metastatic process and to systematically dissect the genetic basis of human disease. Experimentally, we will use a pipeline that relies on organoids from primary human breast cancer tissue to model several distinct steps of metastasis: invasion into the surrounding matrix, dissemination of cancer cell clusters, and outgrowth of these clusters molecular models of distant organs. Computationally, we have developed and applied powerful methods to connect quantitative traits to their genetic basis across multiple complex human disease. We will now apply these computational methods to dissect the molecular basis of breast cancer metastasis. The central insight of our proposal is that the known heterogeneity of breast tumors, while confounding to other methods, enables our quantitative trait loci approach. We will exploit this heterogeneity with computational methods that have the potential to identify the molecular differences between primary human breast tumor organoids that demonstrate metastatic vs. non-metastatic cell behaviors (Aim 1). We will use network analysis techniques to prioritize these as targets, and then use a combination of mammalian genetic engineering and small molecule perturbations to validate targets first in the organoid system and then in accepted mouse PDX models for metastatic growth (Aim 2). Finally, we will combine our novel target based approaches with chemical and genetic perturbagens from the CTD2 Network and broader drug discovery efforts (Aim 3). In this way, we can build on existing knowledge to accelerate our progress towards improved patient outcomes. Success of this program will provide clinically actionable targets for preventing metastatic recurrence or treating patients with established breast cancer metastases. Importantly, our approaches can provide a general platform for dissecting metastasis across epithelial cancers.",2017-09-01T12:09:00Z,2023-07-31T12:07:00Z,RFA-CA-16-014,nofo_RFA-CA-16-014,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,BALTIMORE,MD,UNITED STATES,ctd_2
U01CA217848,Targeting vulnerabilities of therapy-resistant cancer cell states with small molecules,"ABSTRACT Targeted therapies and immunotherapies are two of the most transformative and promising advances in cancer treatment over the last two decades. Yet they, like conventional chemotherapies, frequently succumb to the ability of cancers eventually to resist therapeutic attacks on their vulnerabilities, reversing the initially impressive clinical responses to these treatments. This project focuses on conserved non-mutational mechanisms of resistance that are frequently encountered in resistance arising in multiple therapeutic regimens across multiple cancer types. In the current phase of the CTD2 Network, we developed powerful new tools and capabilities that enable the community to identify novel cancer vulnerabilities. The method relies on the Cancer Therapeutics Response Portal (CTRP), which houses a large dataset of quantitative compound sensitivity data and has been made available without restriction. Using CTRP, we found evidence for the existence of at least one such common therapy-resistant state, associated with mesenchymal characteristics of cancer cells. Importantly, this state emerges from treatment with either chemotherapy or targeted therapeutics across several cancer types. This project aims to fully dissect this pathway, and to discover other such pathways, to understand the bases of resistant-state vulnerabilities, and to learn how to exploit them therapeutically in a safe and effective way.",2017-08-01T12:08:00Z,2022-07-31T12:07:00Z,RFA-CA-16-014,nofo_RFA-CA-16-014,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",CAMBRIDGE,MA,UNITED STATES,ctd_2
U01CA217851,Organoid-based Discovery of Oncogenic Drivers and Treatment Resistance Mechanisms,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The deluge of multi-scale “omics” data from The Cancer Genome Atlas Project (TCGA) and other cancer profiling projects has revealed remarkable genetic and epigenetic complexity and tremendous intrapatient variation. Accordingly, a particularly acute need exists for accurate, scalable human cancer models that can functionally interrogate these extensive datasets, identify driver oncogenic events from benign passengers and characterize their relevance to treatment response. For the last four years the Stanford Cancer Target Discovery and Development (CTD2) Center has pursued human “organoid” culture methods for cancer modeling and driver oncogene discovery. Primary 3D organoid cultures afford the unusual opportunity to initiate cancer de novo within the epi/genetic “tabula rasa” of cultured primary human wild-type tissue, versus the corresponding and often poorly-defined complexity of long- passaged 2D cancer cell lines. This creates a highly defined baseline for cancer modeling and functional driver oncogene validation that is leveraged throughout. Our overall approach applies state-of-the-art systems biology and robust computational resources to large-scale cancer profiling datasets, thus nominating candidate drivers that undergo direct functional evaluation in human organoid culture. This experimental scope leverages a highly synergistic team of Calvin Kuo (reporting PI, organoids), Hanlee Ji (multi-PI, cancer ITH, genomics), Christina Curtis (multi-PI, tumor evolution, cancer systems biology), Olivier Gevaert (cancer systems biology, epigenetics) and Michael Bassik (high-throughput functional genomics). Accordingly, Aims 1 and 2 couple bioinformatic prioritization of TCGA copy number alteration (CNA) and methylation data for driver discovery via organoid-based barcoded lentiviral screens and orthogonal cDNA, shRNA and CRISPR approaches. Aim 3 exploits the ability to longitudinally observe de novo genomic and epigenomic evolution in oncogene- engineered wild-type organoids to nominate networks of cooperating oncogenes that undergo iterative organoid functional validation. Lastly, Aim 4 explores the utility of organoids to model de novo treatment resistance, using archetypal targeted and chemotherapy perturbagens as proof-of-principle and employing single cell RNA- seq/intratumoral heterogeneity and exome sequencing endpoints.",2017-09-01T12:09:00Z,2023-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-16-014,nofo_RFA-CA-16-014,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,STANFORD,CA,UNITED STATES,ctd_2
U01CA217858,Systematic Identification and Pharmacological Targeting of Tumor Dependencies for Precision Cancer Medicine,"PROJECT SUMMARY Successful targets for cancer therapy fall in three main categories: oncogenes that elicit tumor-specific essentiality because of their direct role in tumorigenesis (oncogene dependency), proteins that elicit synthetic lethality with specific mutations despite lack of a direct role in tumorigenesis (non-oncogene dependency), and proteins related to the interaction of tumor cells with the immune system (immune-checkpoint dependency). However, given our current understanding of cancer as a complex and highly heterogeneous system, it is difficult to imagine that an individual protein may represent an effective target for all the billions of cells that make up a typical mass. Indeed, while genetic-based targeted therapy and immunoncology hold great promise a majority of patients still does not respond or will eventually relapse with drug resistant tumors, suggesting that the concept of therapeutic targets as single proteins may need to be revisited. To accomplish this goal, we will leverage a highly successful framework developed by our center investigators for the identification and pharmacological targeting of tumor dependencies implemented by the concerted activity of a handful of Master Regulator (MR) proteins within tightly regulated tumor checkpoint modules. Specifically, we will elucidate and experimentally validate MR proteins and associated Tumor Checkpoint modules of rare and incurable malignancies, on an individual patient basis, by performing network-based analysis of tumor samples signatures using regulatory models reverse engineered from primary tumor samples. We will then prioritize a set of FDA approved drugs and late stage investigational drugs in phase II or phase III studies in oncology (oncology drugs) based on their ability to either target essential/synthetic-lethal MRs (OncoTarget) or to reverse the full MR signature of a tumor (OncoTreat). RNASeq profiles of appropriately matched tumor models perturbed with available oncology drugs will be obtained and analyzed to assess the differential tumor checkpoint activity induced by individual drugs and drug combinations, followed by low-throughput studies to elucidate the regulatory basis of their activity. Models – including cell lines, short-term organotypic culture from tumor explants (EXPL), organoids (ORG), and patient derived xenografts (PDX) – will be selected based on MR protein conservation. We will validate these findings as well as overall efficacy of prioritized drugs and combinations, pharmacodynamic properties, biomarker accuracy and sensitivity, and mechanisms of resistance in suitable in vitro and in vivo models. If successful, this would represent the first mechanistic approach for precision cancer medicine, where therapeutic targets, associated inhibitors, and population stratification biomarkers are systematically derived from precise, mechanistic understanding of tumor state regulation and of its drug-induced modulation.",2017-08-01T12:08:00Z,2022-07-31T12:07:00Z,RFA-CA-16-014,nofo_RFA-CA-16-014,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,NEW YORK,NY,UNITED STATES,ctd_2
U01CA217862,Functional Genomic Discovery of Pathway Targeted and Immune Modulatory Therapeutic Combinations in Hematologic Malignancies,"PROJECT SUMMARY Targeted therapies have been a recent focus of drug development for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), but the majority of patients eventually develop resistance even to these new drugs. There is thus an urgent need to better understand the pathways underlying drug resistance to identify novel drugs or combinations of drugs that can effectively inhibit these pathways. Through our leadership of the Beat AML program as well as other programs in our laboratories oriented towards CLL, we are amassing a large cohort of patient samples with corresponding genomic, functional, clinical and immune annotation. We are developing novel computational tools to extract useful conclusions from these large datasets. The overall goals of this proposal are to leverage our existing cohorts, high-throughput screening tools, and datasets for prediction and pre-clinical testing of novel drug combinations that will eventually be translated into clinical trials. The specific aims of this project are to: (1) use genome-wide CRISPR screening and mass cytometry to create a discovery resource of genomic and immune profiles of 500 primary samples from leukemia patients; (2) develop an integrated computational framework (called PRECEPTS) to infer the cellular processes driving resistance to perturbagens and predict combination targets that can overcome resistance; (3) identify synergistic drug combinations by combining ex vivo testing of single drugs with CRISPR/Cas synthetic lethality screening with genes prioritized by computational prediction, and identify resistance pathways by using RNAseq to profile any residual resistant cells; and (4) use the data from (3) to identify and test drug combinations. This proposed project will contribute to all 3 areas of research interest for the CTD2 by improving our understanding of the molecular processes underlying drug sensitivity and resistance in leukemias, developing algorithms to predict markers and targets in these processes, and identifying drugs and/or combinations that will maximize drug sensitivity and minimize resistance. The proposed studies have direct translational relevance in selecting novel treatment strategies for clinical trials, and will benefit the CTD2 by generating large-scale data sets and providing novel computational tools that can be applied to future studies and expanded beyond leukemias.",2017-09-01T12:09:00Z,2023-07-31T12:07:00Z,RFA-CA-16-014,nofo_RFA-CA-16-014,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,PORTLAND,OR,UNITED STATES,ctd_2
U01CA217864,Integrating targeted and immunotherapy to treat genetically heterogeneous cancers,"Identification of cancer drug targets using high throughput screens of tumor cell lines has led to a number of agents presently in clinical trials. In addition, recent advances in drugs that attack immune cells within tumors, such as αCTLA4 and αPD-1, have highlighted the importance of immune modulation as a strategy for cancer therapy. The next phase of cancer drug target discovery will seek to integrate these strategies to identify combinations of drugs that most efficiently target both tumor cells and the immune components in advanced cancers. The goal of this proposal is to identify and validate these combinations using large-scale data mining and mouse pre-clinical cancer models that mimic the major genetic features of human cancer. This proposal addresses both mechanisms of immune escape by a) finding genetic targets that may enhance tumor mutation load, and b) carrying out high throughout screens in T cells or myeloid cells for targets that promote immune cell infiltration. We will exploit unique mouse models that mirror major genetic categories of human cancer – high vs low mutation load, and strong vs weak immune infiltrate. Applying single-cell RNAseq and mass cytometric proteomic analyses, cutting edge immune composition databases and novel computational network approaches to cancer target discovery using existing large databases, we propose to identify vulnerabilities addressed by combining small molecule drugs with immunotherapy. We will make immunologically “cold” tumors, that do not engage the immune system, into “hot” tumors that present more or stronger antigens, or that encourage infiltration by immune effector cells. To achieve this goal, we propose three highly innovative aims centered on perturbation of specific targets: first by a CRISP/Cas9 screen in immune cells of the tumor microenvironment, second through increasing antigen load in tumors to optimize immune recognition and finally through a network-based identification of tumor-expressed targets that may confer susceptibility to existing immune-oncology therapies. This represents a true `network' of our collective expertise as well as a measured collection of candidate and screening approaches. AIM 1 –We will perform CRISPR screens in monocytes and T-cells to identify genes associated with tumor entry and function in two distinct tumor types. AIM 2– We will use genetic or pharmacological perturbation of newly generated candidate genes involved in metabolic stress and ROS-induced DNA damage to increase mutation load and antigen abundance in a tumor- specific manner, leading to improved responses to immunotherapy. AIM 3 – We will exploit gene expression networks to identify druggable targets and pathways that augment immune responses. This proposal identifies pathways and perturbants for accelerating immunotherapies.",2017-08-17T12:08:00Z,2022-07-31T12:07:00Z,RFA-CA-16-014,nofo_RFA-CA-16-014,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",SAN FRANCISCO,CA,UNITED STATES,ctd_2
U01CA217875,Systematic discovery of neomorph protein-protein interactions in cancer for oncogenic pathway perturbation,"SUMMARY The Molecular Interaction Center for Functional Genomics (MicFG) of Emory University proposes to understand the functions of genomic mutations in cancer etiology through systematic interrogation of mutant allele-mediated oncogenic protein-protein interactions (PPI) for target identification, validation, and perturbagen discovery across cancer types, as a contributing member of the CTD2 Network. For synergistic effort, we have a team of investigators and collaborators with complementary expertise in oncology, high throughput cancer biology and chemical biology, cancer genomics, bioinformatics, computational structural biology and cancer validation models. The wealth of available data for patient tumor-derived mutations offers unprecedented opportunities for translational research to develop personalized therapies. It is these genomic alterations in each driver gene that differentiate tumors from their normal counterparts. However, understanding how to leverage these genomic changes at the mutated amino acid resolution for cancer target discovery and how to rapidly translate this knowledge into genotype-directed cancer therapies for precision oncology remains a daunting and urgent challenge. Our proposal aims to address this critical bottleneck with a team effort by directly focusing on cancer mutation-created protein-protein interactions (neoPPI) for therapeutic discovery. To support this approach, we have generated a comprehensive database representing the landscape of major somatic missense mutations in TCGA pan-cancer datasets, and established a unique bioluminescence resonance energy transfer-based quantitative high throughput wildtype/mutant differential screening (qHT-dS) platform. We hypothesize that oncogenic neoPPIs can be rapidly uncovered by leveraging the cancer missense mutational landscape and implementing a combined high throughput informatics and differential PPI screening platform for discovery and validation of cancer targets for therapeutic discovery. To test this hypothesis, three specific aims are proposed: (i) to identify and validate cancer mutation-created neoPPIs through differential screening with the qHT-dS platform, (ii) to identify neoPPI disruptors as pathway perturbagens, and (iii) to develop and systematically apply integrated informatics pipelines for neoPPI discovery. Our studies will lead to (i) creation of cancer mutation expression vector libraries, large-scale PPI datasets, HTS neoPPI assays as a community resource, and discovery of (ii) tumor-specific neoPPIs as promising cancer-specific targets, (iii) selected neo-PPI perturbagens for oncogenic pathway disruption, and (iv) neoPPI informed potential biomarkers. Complementing the functional annotation of mutant alleles in in vivo models by others, our systematic identification of cancer gene variant- mediated neo-PPIs may reveal promising cancer-specific targets for genotype-directed therapeutic discovery.",2017-08-01T12:08:00Z,2023-07-31T12:07:00Z,RFA-CA-16-014,nofo_RFA-CA-16-014,EMORY UNIVERSITY,ATLANTA,GA,UNITED STATES,ctd_2
U01CA217882,The Cancer Target Discovery and Development Network at UCSF,"PROJECT SUMMARY Our general strategy is to take advantage of novel tools and methodologies that we have developed during our first CTD^2 funding period- more specifically pioneering and applying CRISPR based technologies to aid the discovery and characterization of novel cancer targets and their modulators– using innovative high throughput screening methods. Our end goal is to uncover optimal combinations of perturbagens with the potential to eliminate all cancer cells, despite their clonal heterogeneity and environmental context. One goal is to elucidate new molecular targets with the goal to overcome acquired drug resistance. We build upon an exciting system allowing us to quantitate genotypic and phenotypic cell heterogeneity for hundreds of thousands of single cancer cells. We propose a battery of therapeutic small molecule screens to identify candidate driver genes associated with drug resistance and with recurrent mutations from TCGA, TARGET, CGCI, ICGC and related initiatives. The overall goal is to identify synthetic gene combinations necessary for clinical resistance and related to inter- and intra-tumor heterogeneity. We will develop and apply methodologies for the identification of genes influencing heterotypic cell-cell interactions in tumors. Tumor evolution is a challenging area of research, largely due to the complexity of cell types and behaviors. In this aim, high-throughput screens will be performed to identify non-cell autonomous synthetic lethal and synthetic viable interactions relevant to tumor microenvironment interactions. These studies will include primary T-effector/cancer cell interactions to identify new therapeutic targets and cancer associated macrophage and fibroblast/cancer cell screens to identify genes mediating therapeutic resistance. These systems are made possible by using a currently unpublished screening platform that may help to identify genes important for cancer initiation, maintenance, and possibly metastasis. Since we will use primary and cancer tissue, our unique platform will recapitulate as much as possible the characteristics of tumors in patients and address an important challenge in cancer research. We have developed a novel means to establish genetic epistatic interactions in mammalian cells and will expand upon our efforts to generate specific libraries to map the subset of targets identified in the above screens. In this aim, we will address targets and mechanisms by delineating where targets act in the pathway by probing cancer-defining molecular interdependencies, using the novel targets and screening systems described above. The end goal is to uncover the optimal combination of perturbagens with the potential to eliminate all cancer cells, despite their clonal heterogeneity.",2017-08-10T12:08:00Z,2022-07-31T12:07:00Z,RFA-CA-16-014,nofo_RFA-CA-16-014,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",SAN FRANCISCO,CA,UNITED STATES,ctd_2
U01CA217883,Personalized cancer models to discover and develop new therapeutic targets.,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The wealth of data on the genomics of cancer provides a great opportunity to develop more effective targeted therapies. However, many commonly mutated cancer genes resist efforts to target with drugs, genetic heterogeneity of tumors confounds choice or efficacy of drugs, and development of resistance to commonly used therapies is common, leaving few alternatives. New approaches are needed to address these challenges. Exploiting cellular vulnerabilities generated as a result of mutations in commonly mutated genes, e.g. synthetic lethality, is a promising approach, as illustrated by the recent approval of the PARP inhibitor olaparib in ovarian cancer. We have developed and optimized a synthetic lethal discovery platform that entails high throughput screening to identify novel targets in patient-derived cancer cell cultures and isogenic cell systems. Integration of functional screen results with both patient specific (N of 1) and population-based genomic data is used to prioritize targets useful to the greatest number of patients and in the most appropriate genomic and molecular contexts. Prioritized targets undergo exhaustive confirmation and orthogonal validation in physiologically-relevant settings including genomically characterized patient-derived cell cultures, organoids and patient derived xenograft (PDX) models. Synthetic lethal genes identified with our platform are conserved across species, have been confirmed as candidate drug targets across multiple human cancer types and have led to an investigator initiated clinical trial, illustrating the translational utility of our platform. The outcome of this proposal will be novel validated targets and therapeutic strategies to several human cancer types including those resistant to standard of care agents and a deeper understanding of the biology of several major cancer genes.",2017-09-14T12:09:00Z,2023-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-16-014,nofo_RFA-CA-16-014,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER CENTER,Seattle,WA,UNITED STATES,ctd_2
U01CA217885,A Rational Systematic Approach to Find Combinations of Pharmacologic and Immune Therapies that Target Identifiable Oncogenic States,"A Rational Systematic Approach to Identify Combinations of Pharmacologic and Immune Therapies that Target Identifiable Oncogenic States. Abstract Efforts to sequence large number of human cancers have provided a rich catalog of the most common genetic alterations that driven cancer formation and maintenance. This increasingly accurate mutational landscape has led to the identification of novel targets for therapeutic interventions. However, there is widespread biological and clinical heterogeneity in tumors, even when they share the same driver oncogene mutation. In addition, a high degree of dynamic plasticity and adaptability makes cancers display complex patterns of acquired resistance that manifest clinically. In a similar way, the wide variability of clinical responses to immunotherapy and the onset of immune escape, are becoming a formidable obstacle to fully realize the potential of many new and potentially effective immunotherapies. In this project we will evaluate a rational systematic approach to characterize oncogenic states and their most salient genomic and immune hallmarks in order to infer optimal combinations of pharmacologic and immunological perturbagens that disrupt cancer cell and tumor microenvironment interaction and viability. Our approach is based on our preliminary data, which suggests that in each identifiable oncogenic state there is a close interplay between activation of oncogenic elements, cellular pathways and the immune microenvironment. The project will test this approach with three Specific Aims: Aim 1. Characterize 5-10 pan-cancer oncogenic states with well-defined genomic and immune hallmarks including their specific molecular targets and sensitivity to perturbagens. Aim 2. Computationally infer optimal combinations of pharmacological and immunological perturbagens. Aim 3. Experimentally validate single and combinations of perturbagens identified in Aim 2. This innovative approach will provide a rich source of CTD2 datasets and resources including a catalog of oncogenic states, their most salient genomic and immune hallmarks, associated targets and validated combinations of pharmacologic and immune therapies that are effective at targeting tumors. These results will lead directly to the development of clinical trials, novel treatment strategies and provide the foundation for a new generation of more comprehensive, functional-based, precision medicine approaches.",2017-09-12T12:09:00Z,2023-07-31T12:07:00Z,RFA-CA-16-014,nofo_RFA-CA-16-014,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",LA JOLLA,CA,UNITED STATES,ctd_2
U01CA220323,Using patient-derived models to understand drug responses in SCLC,"PROJECT SUMMARY Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) afflicts more than 30,000 patients per year and is rapidly fatal in 95% of cases, with median survival is less than one year. Belying this grim prognosis, treatment-naive SCLC is highly sensitive to chemotherapy, with response rates in excess of 70% for etoposide/platinum. However, relapse is nearly inevitable, and relapsed SCLC presents two obstacles that have been insurmountable for at least 30 years: cross-resistance to chemotherapy, and absence of biomarker-driven targeted therapy. Following relapse, resistance often extends beyond etoposide/platinum, and a disease that was once highly chemosensitive becomes inexorably progressive. However, the molecular determinants of cross-resistance in SCLC remain unclear. Although critically important, cross-resistance is difficult to study experimentally, as it requires a model system that faithfully reproduces clinical outcomes. Topotecan is the only approved second-line therapy, but NCCN guidelines list 10 agents of nearly equivalent efficacy. None are particularly effective in unselected patients, and although there is significant molecular heterogeneity in SCLC, this does not guide patient selection. As novel targets and therapeutic regimens emerge, biomarker discovery will require a model system that recapitulates the molecular features of patient tumors, so that molecular heterogeneity can be parsed into clinically meaningful subgroups. We have generated a panel of 44 SCLC patient-derived xenograft models (PDXs) from biopsy specimens and circulating tumor cells (CTCs). Our panel includes successive models from individual patients at time points before and after specific lines of therapy, with detailed information about the corresponding clinical response. For both standard chemotherapy and experimental agents in clinical trial, these models faithfully mirror patient responses. However, unlike the patient experience, multiple strategies can be compared for identical tumors. We propose to use these models to directly compare standard first and second-line chemotherapy with two experimental regimens that have given promising results in the clinic or in preclinical assays: olaparib plus temozolomide, in a phase I/II trial at MGH, and a combined Mcl-1/Bcl-2 inhibitors. Individually, these PDX population trials are designed to reveal biomarkers of sensitivity and mechanisms of resistance for promising experimental therapies. Collectively, they present a novel opportunity to model cross-resistance through comparative analysis with reference to the clinical histories of each model. The successful completion of this work will establish a large collection of PDX models with comprehensive molecular an functional profiles. In addition, these experiments will investigate the molecular determinants of cross-resistance following chemotherapy, a problem that has beleaguered management of SCLC for over three decades.",2018-09-17T12:09:00Z,2024-02-29T12:02:00Z,PAR-16-049,nofo_PAR-16-049,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,BOSTON,MA,UNITED STATES,sclc
U01CA220378,Quantifying Multiscale Competitive Landscapes of Clonal Diversity in Glioblastoma,"ABSTRACT Glioblastoma (GBM) exhibits profound intratumoral molecular heterogeneity that contributes to treatment resistance and poor survival. Specifically, each tumor comprises multiple molecularly-distinct subpopulations with different treatment sensitivities. This heterogeneity not only portends the pre-existence of resistant molecular subpopulations, but also the communications between neighboring subpopulations that further modulate tumorigenicity and resistance. In fact, a minority tumor subpopulation with EGFRvIII mutation has been shown to potentiate a majority subpopulation with wild-type EGFR to increase tumor growth, cell survival, and drug resistance. This type of cooperativity presents clear implications for improving GBM treatment. Yet compared to other tumor types, the interactions in GBM remain critically understudied. A significant barrier to studying the interactions between molecularly-distinct subpopulations is the challenge of tissue sampling in GBM. In particular, contrast-enhanced MRI (CE-MRI) routinely guides surgical biopsy and resection of the MRI enhancing core, but fails to address the diverse subpopulations of the surrounding non-enhancing parenchyma (so called “brain around tumor” or BAT). These unresected residual subpopulations in BAT represent the main contributors to tumor recurrence, which can exhibit different therapeutic targets (and interactions) compared with enhancing biopsies. To address the limitations of tissue sampling, imaging techniques can help quantitatively characterize tumors in their entirety, including unresected BAT regions. Our group has used multi-parametric MRI and image-guided biopsies to develop and validate machine-learning (ML) models of intratumoral genomic heterogeneity, with particular focus on the BAT zone. In Aim 1, will we collect and molecularly profile a large set of image-recorded stereotactic biopsies in primary GBM patients to quantify the diversity of molecularly-distinct subpopulations, as well as their phenotypic niches, throughout the BAT zone. We will assess local heterogeneity at the biopsy level and also co-localize regional patterns and rates of recurrence on serial MRI. In Aim 2, we will use these biopsies and spatially matched MRI metrics to refine our existing ML predictive models. We will use these ML models to co- localize spatial patterns of molecularly-distinct subpopulations (and their phenotypic niches) to quantify their risk of regional recurrence. In Aim 3, we will functionally validate the subpopulation interactions observed in Aims 1 and 2 using patient derived xenograft (PDX) models. We will also validate these interactions in human GBM using a subset of spatially matched biopsies from primary and recurrent tumors in the same patients. This proposal leverages our unique expertise in image-guided tissue analysis and MRI-based computational modeling to study the diversity of molecularly-distinct subpopulations and the evolving competitive landscapes in human GBM. This work will help risk stratify patients in future targeted clinical drug trials and should also facilitate new strategies (e.g., adaptive therapy) to exploit subpopulation co-dependency for therapeutic benefit.",2017-09-12T12:09:00Z,2023-08-31T12:08:00Z,PAR-16-131,nofo_PAR-16-131,MAYO CLINIC ARIZONA,SCOTTSDALE,AZ,UNITED STATES,csbc
U01CA220401,Informatics Tools for Quantitative Digital Pathology Profiling and Integrated Prognostic Modeling,"PROJECT SUMMARY Accurate biomarker-driven prognostic stratification, response prediction, and cohort enrichment are critical for realizing precision treatment strategies and population health management approaches that optimize quality of life and survival for cancer patients. Genomics holds promise for improving classification and prognostication of malignancies, yet oncology practice continues to rely heavily on immunohistochemistry (IHC) as a fundamental tool due to its practicality and ability to provide protein-level and subcellular localization information. The goal of this proposal is to create an open-source software resource for the quantitative analysis of IHC stained tissues and effective integration of IHC, genomic, and clinical features for cancer classification and prognostication. This proposal builds on our collective experience in computer-assisted analysis of microscopic images (including IHC images), development of machine-learning methods to address the challenges of classification and prognostication with heterogeneous and high-dimensional data, and leadership in collection and large-scale analysis of cancer outcomes involving collaboration with multiple medical centers. This effort for the first time will create tools to integrate quantitative IHC imaging, clinical, and genomic information that will in turn enable the research community to explore strategies for the classification of malignancies and prediction of outcomes. The proposed tools will be developed and extensively validated in close collaboration with clinical, genomic, and digital pathology data from the NCI-supported Lymphoma Epidemiology of Outcomes (LEO) cohort study. The software tools produced by this proposal will enable the characterization of subcellular protein expression in cell nuclei, membranes and cytoplasmic compartments. Spatial features of protein expression heterogeneity, along with patient-level summaries of protein expression will be used to develop machine-learning classifiers for cancer subtypes, using diffuse large b-cell lymphomas as a driving application. Technology for automatic tuning of machine learning algorithms will enable a broad class of clinically and biologically motivated users to utilize these tools in their investigations. We will also provide an interactive dashboard that enables users to integrate genomic and IHC-based features to explore prognostic models of patient survival. These tools will be released and documented under an open-source model, integrated with HistomicsTK (https://histomicstk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), and available to the broader cancer research community.",2018-06-12T12:06:00Z,2023-05-31T12:05:00Z,PAR-15-332,nofo_PAR-15-332,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,CHICAGO,IL,UNITED STATES,itcr
U01CA220413,An interactive analysis toolkit for single cell RNA-seq in cancer research,"Project Summary/Abstract Cancer is an extremely heterogeneous disease both within and across individuals, leading to the need for individualized treatment regimens and novel strategies for early detection and prevention. Each cancer cell harbors a unique profile of somatic genome alterations and gene expression changes that have been acquired over time. In addition, the microenvironment of each tumor contains a complex mixture of immune cells, unaltered epithelial cells, and stromal cells. Interactions between these various cell types create an ecosystem that can ultimately promote or inhibit tumor growth. Single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a new genomic approach that enables the study of the transcriptomes of individual cells. With this technology, researchers can assess the variability in transcriptional pathways in cancer cells from resected tissue and can characterize cellular populations present in the tumor microenvironment in an unbiased fashion. However, scRNA-seq data are complex and require advanced analytical techniques. We hope to leverage previously developed computational tools to develop, apply and validate a coordinated framework for processing and analyzing scRNA-seq data. Specifically, our toolkit will consist of a seamless workflow that incorporates modules for (A) quality control and batch correction, (B) sample size and sequencing depth estimation, (C) cell- level classification and identification, cell sorting, and dimension reduction, (D) differential expression and differential cell abundance, and (E) functional pathway profiling. Our software will fill a significant need by providing a comprehensive and user-friendly R-based analysis framework for scRNA-seq that is approachable by researchers with or without strong computational backgrounds. Ultimately, this toolkit will accelerate studies seeking to understand how transcriptional and cellular heterogeneity plays a role in tumor development and treatment.",2017-08-01T12:08:00Z,2021-07-31T12:07:00Z,PAR-15-332,nofo_PAR-15-332,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,BOSTON,MA,UNITED STATES,itcr

One possible reason for this is the unique biology of the pancreatic cancer in establishing an immune suppressive microenvironment. We find that cross communication between cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs), tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) and tumor cells is critical. Using animal models of PDA, we find that tumor cells polarize macrophages to TAMs both by activating CAFs to produce IL6 and by producing specific metabolites. TAMs then both suppress the immune response by arginine depletion by making Arginase 1 and by producing EGFR ligands, primarily HBEGF, to stimulate pancreatic cancer cells to express PDL1, an immune checkpoint ligand. We propose to use a combination of matched humanized patient derived xenografts (PDXs), organoid culture systems made up of cancer cells, immune cells and CAFs (ie “microtumors”) and a unique dual recombinase genetically engineered mouse model of PDA to test the hypothesis that treatment of tumors with inhibitors of STAT3, HBEGF, ARG1 or MEK will effectively synergize with PD1 inhibition, overcoming the powerful immune suppression created by the pancreatic cancer microenvironment.",2017-09-30T12:09:00Z,2023-02-28T12:02:00Z,RFA-CA-17-015,nofo_CA-17-015,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,ANN ARBOR,MI,UNITED STATES,pacmen

Despite success in other cancer types, immunotherapy approaches in PDAC have not shown efficacy. PDAC demonstrates a heterogeneous and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) that is poorly understood and serves as a barrier to effective immunotherapy strategies in this disease. We propose that an improved understanding of the TME and novel approaches that target key tumor-stroma interactions will enable remodeling of the immunosuppressive TME to enhance the efficacy of current and future immunotherapy strategies. In particular, we believe that successful combination immunotherapy approaches in PDAC will include strategies that alter myeloid cells to relieve immunosuppression, cytotoxic therapies that target tumor cells to improve immune response, and agents that augment anti-tumor T cell activity. In this project, we will perform a comprehensive characterization of the PDAC TME in both primary and metastatic PDAC in the baseline untreated context as well as across multiple different clinical therapies. In Aim 1, we will utilize single-cell transcriptomic and proteomic technologies to provide a cellular atlas of the PDAC TME at unprecedented resolution.

U01CA224175,Defining neoantigen immunodominance for antigen selection and biomarker discovery in human pancreatic cancer immunotherapy,"PROJECT SUMMARY Checkpoint blockade immunotherapy has induced dramatic responses in treatment refractory cancers by targeting neoantigens encoded by cancer-specific mutations. Neoantigen load predicts immunotherapeutic response, validating antigen identification as a rational strategy of biomarker discovery. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) however has shown limited efficacy to checkpoint blockade immunotherapy due to presumed neoantigen paucity. However, systematic antigen discovery in PDAC is lacking. 3% of PDAC patients survive > 5 years (long term survivors). As T cell immunity may explain this extreme outcome, they represent the ideal cohort for deep antigen discovery. Using genomic, molecular, and cellular immunoprofiling, computational evolutionary modeling, and neoantigen discovery in these rare long term survivors (n=82), we have discovered that neoantigen quality, but not quantity, is prognostic of survival, and that long term survivors evidence lasting neoantigen-specific T cell immunity. The scientific objectives of this proposal are to address questions essential to translate these findings - 1) is there stage and treatment- specific neoantigen heterogeneity, 2) can neoantigens be identified in the peripheral blood, and 3) can neoantigen quality predict response to immunotherapy. The translational objective is to develop novel tissue and blood-based biomarkers for rational patient and target selection for immunotherapy. The proposal utilizes several highly unique tissue collection strategies – a) laparoscopic multi-site biopsies to identify stage-specific heterogeneity, b) serial pre- and post-chemotherapy assessment for treatment-specific modulation, and c) evaluation of neoantigen quality as a predictive biomarker on a large, immunotherapeutic PDAC trial. This initiative will also for the first time develop the ability to identify neoantigens in circulating exosomes for blood-based biomarker assessment. The research methodology employs next generation sequencing, transcriptional profiling, computational biophysical modeling, clonotypic T cell profiling, neoantigen discovery, and functional assessments to evaluate the prognostic, predictive, and therapeutic potential of neoantigens.

U01CA224193,Disrupting the immune and drug-privileged microenvironment in pancreas cancer,"PROJECT SUMMARY Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDA) develop an intense fibroinflammatory infiltrate that helps promote disease progression and therapeutic resistance. Recent progress has identified essential barriers in this complex microenvironment that impede drug delivery and suppress immunity. These processes include the prohibitive interstitial pressures generated by high concentrations of hyaluronan (HA) complexed with water, dense fibrosis associated with fibrillar collagen deposition, and multiple classes of immunosuppressive and pro-tumorigenic cells such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells and macrophages. The team assembled in this project has made many of the seminal discoveries described above. In addition, we have developed several highly novel and powerful experimental platforms to rigorously interrogate the complex mechanisms and interactions among various compartments in the tumor microenvironment that collectively conspire to promote the survival of pancreas cancers and metastases and thwart treatment. Our overarching hypothesis is that significantly improving survival for PDA patients will require targeting not only the tumor epithelial cell, but also the three compartments that support its oncogenesis: hematopoietic, mesenchymal and extracellular matrix. In the following, we propose to investigate the combination of cytotoxic therapy with stromal disruption and myeloid cell modulations to maximize engagement of anti-tumor immunity and treatment efficacy. We will pursue these investigations in four distinct experimental platforms that offer complementary strengths and mitigate limitations: 1) genetically engineered mouse models (GEMM) of autochthonous PDA; 2) syngeneic allografts; 3) patient-derived xenograft (PDX) systems; and 4) patient-derived organoids (PDO).",2017-09-30T12:09:00Z,2022-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-17-015,nofo_RFA-CA-17-015,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,SEATTLE,WA,UNITED STATES,pacmen

U01CA224276,Phenotype Interactions in SCLC Development and Detection,"PROJECT SUMMARY Small Cell Lung Carcinoma (SCLC) is an aggressive neuroendocrine subtype of lung cancer. SCLC patients have a very low 5-year survival, in part because SCLC tumors are often detected at a late stage when the tumors have already metastasized and treatment outcomes are worse. Thus, early detection becomes critical to achieve better treatment results. Emerging evidence supports the idea that, while SCLC tumors seem homogeneous when examined under a microscope, these tumors contain a significant level of intra-tumoral heterogeneity. Indeed, recent observations by our group and others have identified distinct cellular phenotypes in SCLC, including in primary human tumors, in cell lines derived from human tumors, and in tumors from genetically-engineered mouse models. Importantly, data from our group indicate that these cellular phenotypes contribute to SCLC development. The specific goal of this proposal is to elucidate how different cellular subpopulations within SCLC tumors drive early SCLC development, dynamics, and growth and to leverage this mechanistic information to identify biomarkers for early detection and prevention of SCLC. We have previously identified tumor-propagating cells (TPCs) in SCLC tumors and found that these cells are neuroendocrine and strongly tumorigenic. We have also characterized cell populations derived from these TPCs with distinct phenotypes, including non-neuroendocrine NOTCH+ and CD44+ subpopulations, that promote the growth and survival of the neuroendocrine TPCs. Leveraging these findings as well as our unique genetic mouse models that allow dissection of SCLC phenotype evolution, we will investigate how cell-cell interactions of these distinct SCLC cell phenotypes contribute to tumor development and growth, in relationship with the tumor microenvironment. We will also elucidate the role of secretory factors released by these SCLC subpopulations in driving survival, growth, and phenotype composition of SCLC tumors. Finally, we will perform analysis of cfDNA and proteins (including on exosomes) present in SCLC patient plasma for identification of related markers of SCLC development and early detection. We will also follow up on intriguing findings that germline mutations in NOTCH are present in a large fraction of SCLC patients, suggesting a potential risk marker beyond smoking. This interdisciplinary basic-translational project will elucidate fundamental mechanisms of SCLC development and may lead to novel methods for early detection and/or prevention of SCLC.",2018-09-19T12:09:00Z,2024-08-31T12:08:00Z,PAR-16-051,nofo_PAR-16-051,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,Nashville,TN,UNITED STATES,sclc
U01CA224293,Targeting BCAT1 and branched-chain amino acid metabolism for the detection and prevention of SCLC,"Summary The high mortality of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is largely due to its invariable resistance to current cytotoxic therapies. Chemoprevention has been considered as an alternative to existing therapeutics on the basis of long tumor latency and the well-defined high-risk population (e.g. smokers). Identification of tractable targets for prevention and early detection requires an understanding of molecular changes underlying early- stage tumor development. We found that enhanced ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis are critical for MYC family-driven transformation of precancerous precursors (preSC) into fully tumorigenic cells. Both human and mouse SCLC cells are extremely sensitive to a specific inhibitor of ribosome biogenesis that has also been shown to reduce tumor growth in a genetically engineered mouse model. Analysis of the MYC-driven oncogenic gene signature revealed branched-chain aminotransferase 1 (BCAT1) as a potential modulator of both metabolic adaptation and related stress response to promote cellular homeostasis. BCAT1 is an enzyme that catalyzes transfer of the α-amino nitrogen from branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs including leucine) to α-ketoglutarate to produce branched-chain α-keto acids (BCKAs) and glutamate. This enzyme routes BCAAs into multiple metabolite pools for biosynthesis and regulates levels of BCAAs, specifically leucine, that stimulate protein synthesis by acting as indicators of nutrient availability. BCAT1 has recently been implicated in multiple types of cancers, including glioblastoma and mouse Kras/p53-driven lung adenocarcinoma. In this application, we will test the hypotheses that enhanced BCAT1 promotes SCLC development by controlling protein synthesis and stress response, and that altered levels of BCAA metabolites inform early BCAT1- dependent SCLC development. To test these hypotheses, we propose the following Aims. Aim 1: To determine the necessity of BCAT1 for SCLC development, we will evaluate the tumor suppressive effects of knocking out Bcat1 and examine the effects of pharmacological inhibition of BCAT1 on SCLC development and long-term survival in vivo. Aim 2: To determine the role of BCAT1 in protein synthesis and stress response during SCLC development, we will manipulate BCAT1 and determine the resulting impact on biochemical interactions among related proteins and pathways that influence proliferation and survival of L-Myc-induced transforming cells, a model of early stage SCLC. We will also determine the significance of BCAA metabolism in tumor development in vivo by setting up variable conditions that mimic different outcomes of the metabolic reaction using a BCAA-defined diet. Aim 3: To test alterations in BCAA metabolites as biomarkers for BCAT1- dependent SCLC development, we will monitor changes in plasma BCAA and BCKA levels during SCLC development in vivo and examine the clinical correlation of plasma levels of these metabolites with a SCLC diagnosis. The expected outcome of this proposal will provide critical insights into novel strategies for targeted prevention using minimally invasive detection methods and intervention using low-toxicity drugs or nutrition.",2018-09-10T12:09:00Z,2024-08-31T12:08:00Z,PAR-16-051,nofo_PAR-16-051,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,CHARLOTTESVILLE,VA,UNITED STATES,sclc
U01CA224326,Studies of the initiation and progression of small cell lung cancer using cells derived by differentiation from human pluripotent stem cells,"PROJECT SUMMARY Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an especially virulent form of lung cancer that is only transiently responsive to therapy and kills about 30,000 Americans each year. Based on a more general interest in understanding why certain kinds of cancers have characteristic genotypes, we are developing methods for studying the initiation of human cancers by genetically modifying cells at discrete stages of differentiation after chemical induction of specific lineages from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). We have extended recently published methods for inducing hESCs to form parts of the pulmonary lineage by perturbing NOTCH signaling and reducing expression of the RB1 gene (one of the two genes commonly inactivated in SCLC); in this way, we have prepared cultures with high proportions of pulmonary neuroendocrine cells (PNECs), the putative precursors of SCLC. Moreover, by also reducing expression of P53, the other gene commonly inactivated in SCLC, PNEC-containing cultures are able to produce small tumors resembling SCLC when implanted in immune-deficient mice. We now propose to expand our studies of this promising model for studying the origins of SCLC in several ways: by determining the mechanisms by which interference with NOTCH and RB1 generates PNECs; by exploring several possible assays for the SCLC-like phenotype we have recently observed; by defining the similarities between the genetic and physiological features of the SCLCs derived from hESCs and the SCLCs arising in human patients; and by making induced pleuropotent stem cells (iPSCs) from normal and tumor cells from patients with lung cancer, especially SCLC, in an effort to seek genetic risk factors for SCLC. Through these studies, we expect to generate new information and ideas about risk assessment, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment for SCLC. !",2018-02-09T12:02:00Z,2024-01-31T12:01:00Z,PAR-16-051,nofo_PAR-16-051,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,NEW YORK,NY,UNITED STATES,sclc
U01CA224348,Reprogramming PDAC tumor microenvironment to improve immunotherapy,"We have recently shown in preclinical studies using clinically relevant pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) models that angiotensin system inhibitors (ASIs), including the angiotensin receptor blocker losartan, can enhance the delivery and efficacy of cytotoxic agents by affecting the tumor microenvironment (PNAS 2011, Nat Commun 2013). The mechanisms underlying this benefit include “normalization” of cancer-associated fibroblasts and extracellular matrix (ECM), resulting in blood vessel decompression, improved perfusion, and decreased hypoxia. These exciting preclinical findings formed the basis of an ongoing Phase II clinical trial at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), which combines losartan with cytotoxic therapy – FOLFIRINOX and then chemoradiotherapy in unresectable locally advanced PDAC (NCT01821729). An interim analysis of this trial indicates that adding losartan to neoadjuvant cytotoxic therapy doubles the frequency of conversion to resectable tumors (52%) and strikingly improves overall survival (OS) in these PDAC patients. Remarkably, transcriptomic analysis of tumor biopsies from PDAC patients further indicates that ASI treatment not only normalizes ECM-related phenotypes but also upregulates key pathways associated with anti-tumor immunity involving both adaptive (e.g., CD8+ T cells) and innate (e.g., dendritic cells (DCs)) immune components of the PDAC tumor microenvironment. Based on these preclinical and clinical findings, we hypothesize that ASIs in combination with cytotoxic agents will reprogram the heterogeneous, pro-fibrotic, and immunosuppressive PDAC tumor microenvironment to one that is immunostimulatory. We further propose that combining ASIs and cytotoxic agents will enhance the delivery and efficacy of immunotherapies, which until now have had limited or no benefit in PDAC patients. To test these hypotheses, we designed three Specific Aims: 1) Uncover how losartan combined with cytotoxic agents alters tumor microenvironmental components (ECM, blood vessels, hypoxia) and immune cells, in locally advanced PDAC patients; 2) Dissect the causal role of drug- induced adaptive and innate immune cells in the anti-tumor response in orthotopic (implanted and genetically engineered) PDAC models in mice; and 3) Evaluate whether combining ASI-induced tumor microenvironment reprogramming along with cytotoxic therapies enhances the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockers. Based on our preclinical and clinical data, our tightly integrated and multidisciplinary team of investigators, and our bench-to-bedside-and-back research approach, we anticipate that successful completion of these studies will positively impact the development of new treatments for locally advanced PDAC patients who currently have a 5-year survival rate of ~11%.

U01CA226196,Bioinformatics Technology to Characterize Tumor Infiltrating Immune Repertoires,"PROJECT SUMMARY The repertoires of tumor-infiltrating T cells and B cells are rich sources of information about cancer-immune interactions and provide insights on cancer immunotherapy targets. Efforts have been made to characterize B/T cell repertoires in solid tumors using cell sorting followed by targeted deep sequencing. However, these approaches may produce biased estimates during tissue disaggregation and can be expensive when applied to large sample cohorts. Massively parallel mRNA sequencing (RNA-seq) technology has become the mainstream method to profile gene expression and thousands of solid tumor RNA-seq profiles are available in the public domain. The rich collection of tumor RNA-seq datasets provides an alternative approach to study tumor-infiltrating B/T cell repertoires in solid tumors. Our team has recently developed a statistical method TIMER for deconvolving different immune components in the tumor microenvironment, and TRUST for inferring the hypervariable complementarity determining regions (CDRs) of the tumor infiltrating T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire from bulk tumor RNA-seq data in the public domain. Our preliminary analysis indicated that there are approximately ten times as many B cell receptor (BCR) reads and TCR reads, suggesting that extracting the BCR repertoires from bulk tumor RNA-seq could reveal important insights on B cell mediated tumor immunity. The aims of this proposal are: to extend our TRUST algorithm to extract B cell receptor (BCR) repertoires from tumor RNA-seq data, and identify somatic hypermutations and immunoglobin class switches (Aim 1); to systematically analyze TCR and BCR repertoires from large scale tumor RNA-seq cohorts, and develop a user friendly web interface to allow cancer immunologists or immuno-oncologists to investigate tumor-immune associations (Aim 2); to promote the utility of our tumor immune resource through collaborations, cloud sharing, and outreach (Aim 3). We will deliver a robust bioinformatics algorithm to systematically identify BCR / TCR repertoires from bulk tumor RNA-seq data and a user-friendly resource for cancer immunologists or immuno-oncologists to explore tumor- immune interactions from large tumor profiling cohorts in the public as well as their unpublished data. The successful execution of this proposal has the potential to inform clinical practice of cancer immunotherapies, including adoptive T cell transfer, therapeutic cancer vaccines or antibodies. Our proposed cancer immunology algorithm and resource will be a unique addition to the array of bioinformatics tools developed by the Information Technology for Cancer Research at the National Cancer Institute.",2018-04-06T12:04:00Z,2022-03-31T12:03:00Z,PAR-15-332,nofo_PAR-15-332,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,BOSTON,MA,UNITED STATES,itcr
U01CA227544,Reverse Sensitivity Analysis for Identifying Predictive Proteomics Signatures of Cancer,"Title: Reverse Sensitivity Analysis for Identifying Proteomics Signatures of Cancer Abstract Cancer is a complex disease in which genetic disruptions in cell signaling networks are known to play a significant role. A major aim of cancer systems biology is to build models that can predict the impact of these genetic disruptions to guide therapeutic interventions (i.e. personalized medicine). A prominent driver of cancer cell growth is signaling pathway deregulation from mutations in key regulatory nodes and loss/gain in gene copy number (CNV). However, current mathematical modeling approaches do not adequately capture the impact of these genetic changes. Reasons for this include the poorly understood layers of regulation between gene expression and protein activity, and limitations in most modeling and protein measurement technologies. In addition, there is a paucity of overarching hypotheses that can link specific gene expression or mutation patterns to the cancer phenotype. Recent work by our group has resolved some of the technical challenges that have hindered the application of proteomics technologies to cancer systems biology research. It has also suggested a new approach for using quantitative proteomics data to understand mechanisms driving cancer cell behavior. Using an ultrasensitive, targeted proteomics platform that can measure both abundance and phosphorylation of proteins present at only hundreds of copies per cell, we found that signaling pathways appeared to be controlled by only a limited number of key nodes whose activity is tightly regulated through low abundance and feedback phosphorylation. We propose to build on these findings by critically testing the hypothesis that CNV and genetic mutations dysregulate signaling pathways in cancer by shifting control from tightly regulated nodes to poorly regulated ones. This will be done by systematically identifying key regulatory nodes of normal and cancer cells using CRISPRa/i screens, determine the relationship between protein abundance and signaling pathway activities using ultrasensitive targeted proteomics and phosphoproteomics and then use these data to semi-automatically generate mathematical models of the functional topology of the signaling pathways. Specifically, we propose to: 1) Use targeted CRISPR gene perturbation libraries to identify the regulatory topologies of signaling pathways important in cancer and how they are disrupted by common cancer mutations, 2) Use the CRISPR perturbation and proteomics data to semi-automatically build predictive models of cancer cell signaling pathways, and 3) Combine modeling and perturbation screens to understand how feedback regulation in cancer contributes to drug resistance. This work will result in simplified, computationally tractable yet mechanistic models of signaling pathways and provide network maps of feedback and crosstalk circuits that can be used to rapidly map the regulatory state of cells. Most important, it will provide a generic platform for translating protein abundance and phosphorylation patterns into a “state” snapshot of cancers that can lead to predicting their response to specific drugs.",2019-05-01T12:05:00Z,2024-04-30T12:04:00Z,PAR-16-131,nofo_PAR-16-131,BATTELLE PACIFIC NORTHWEST LABORATORIES,RICHLAND,WA,UNITED STATES,csbc
U01CA227550,A plasticity and reprogramming paradigm for therapy resistance at the single cell level,"Project summary Targeted therapies in melanoma have shown enormous promise in the sense that they can show dramatic reductions in tumor burden, with melanoma being a particularly stark example. However, this promise has failed to be fully realized because of the emergence of resistant tumor cells, which repopulate the tumor and are subsequently difficult or impossible to treat effectively. Typically, scientists have thought of therapy resistance as having genetic origins, with rare mutant tumor cells surviving therapy because of a mutation that causes resistance. Recent work from our labs using advanced single cell analysis, however, suggest that, at the point of attack, there may be other, complementary, non-genetic mechanisms that could also govern exactly why some rare cells are able to evade the effects of the therapy. Subsequently, the targeted therapy itself can reprogram these rare cells into a stably resistant population. This more nuanced “plasticity and reprogramming” view of resistance at the single cell level has opened the possibility of a far richer set of targets that can be exploited for forestalling therapy resistance; however, the current set of tools and models, both experimental and computational, for identifying these targets are underdeveloped and the origin of these biological processes remain mysterious. Here, we propose to develop and apply new concepts and methods in experimental and computational single cell biology to tackle the problem of non-genetic therapy resistance, translating our basic science results towards the clinic through the use of sophisticated in vivo models of melanoma. In Aim 1, we will identify and validate the pathways that govern cellular plasticity in melanoma. We will develop new tools to identify gene networks associated with plasticity, and then deploy new tools, both computational and experimental, to identify vulnerabilities in those networks, ultimately testing whether those vulnerabilities recapitulate in more realistic in vivo settings. In Aim 2, we will develop a tool for revealing the pathways associated with reprogramming. Then, combining this information, we will develop a computational model to predict optimal timed dosing strategies that incorporate these non-genetic rare-cell vulnerabilities into a comprehensive framework. We will then test this framework on patient-derived xenograft models of melanoma to demonstrate the potential clinical impact of our findings on melanoma treatment.",2018-06-01T12:06:00Z,2023-05-31T12:05:00Z,PAR-16-131,nofo_PAR-16-131,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,PHILADELPHIA,PA,UNITED STATES,csbc
U01CA230669,NOVEL STRATEGIES TO IMPROVE LIVER CANCER SURVEILLANCE UPTAKE AND EARLY DETECTION,"ABSTRACT This proposal is submitted in response to RFA-CA-17-025. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary liver cancer and one of the few cancers with increasing incidence in the United States. Survival of patients with HCC is poor because most patients are diagnosed at late stages when treatment options are limited. HCC surveillance can detect cancers early and improve survival but it is inconsistently implemented. Not all liver nodules detected on surveillance imaging are malignant, these indeterminate nodules require follow up imaging to determine if they are HCC. This proposal assembles a team of specialists with complementary expertise in liver diseases, liver cancer, radiology, engineering, statistics, and information technology. The goals are to: (1) Improve HCC surveillance uptake in patients with cirrhosis by leveraging electronic medical records to remind healthcare providers and patients when they are due for screening tests; (2) Leverage analytic morphomics and machine learning to increase the detectability of HCC at an early stage; and (3) Increase detectability of HCC at an early stage using tagged HCC-specific peptides. We have worked closely together for many years and have participated/led many NIH funded clinical research networks. We have expertise and experience to carry out the proposed studies and will collaborate with other centers in the Liver Center Network to validate the methods/models we develop. We will also enroll patients with cirrhosis and collect data and specimens and provide access to existing well characterized data and specimen repositories that include both prevalent and incident HCC for Trans-Network studies. We are confident we will be able to contribute to this Liver Cancer Network and to early detection of HCC in multiple ways.",2018-09-13T12:09:00Z,2024-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-17-025,nofo_RFA-CA-17-025,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,ANN ARBOR,MI,UNITED STATES,tlc
U01CA230690,Pathway Specific Functional Biomarkers for the Early Detection of Liver Cancer,"ABSTRACT Here, we propose to validate tissue and blood-based combinatorial biomarker panels, derived from functional pathway-specific studies, to improve the early detection of liver cancer [hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)] and stratify populations according to their risk for developing HCC. In its early stages, HCC is curable; once advanced, HCC is associated with high mortality. Most early HCCs are undetected, demonstrating the challenge in predicting and diagnosing early HCC. Through preclinical studies that integrate analysis of human genomic data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), mouse models, and human tissue/cell line studies, we determined that specific high-risk populations may be identified through alterations in the following biomarkers: EpCAM, Osteopontin (OPN), the polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) the TGF-β and DNA repair members. We have established a multi-center consortium of 4 Translational Research Centers (TRCs): Johns Hopkins University (TRC1), George Washington University (TRC2), University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (TRC3), University of Hawaii (TRC4). These 4 TRCs will work in collaboration with NCI to implement a multi-institutional framework to collect the highest quality biospecimens from patients with various well-defined liver pathologies and conduct specific biomarker validation studies for early detection of HCC and risk stratification of patients with cirrhosis. The central hypothesis, based upon our functional preclinical models and pilot studies in human liver disease samples, is that alterations in the above markers lead to HCC, and that aberrant expression of these can lead to early detection of HCC, as well as risk stratification. Specifically, the following biomarker panels will be assessed (a) Tissue EpCAM, OPN, PLK1 levels (Panel 1, Project 1, TRC1), (b) Tissue levels of TBR2, SPTBN1, FancD2 and Sirt6 (Panel 2, Project 2 TRC2). (c) Serum markers (Panel 3, EpCAM, OPN, TGF-β) will be tested in TRC1 and 2; (d) In circulating tumor cells (CTCs), mutational analyses (Panel 4, Smad4 and SPTBN1, Project 2, TRC2) and surface vimentin (CSV) (Panel 5, Project 3, TRC3) will be performed. Validation of candidate biomarkers (Project 4, TRC4) will also be done at TRC4, and also with collaborations in NCI, China and external cohorts, that include EDRN samples. The 4 projects will collectively address: Aim 1: EDRN Phase 2 studies (to find markers of current HCCs) in tissue only using panels 1 and 2. All samples are retrospective, collected in patients (cases) and controls. Aim 2: EDRN Phase 2 studies in blood only on panels 3, 4 and 5. Here, all samples are retrospective, collected in current cases and current controls. Aim 3: EDRN Phase 3 studies (Panel 3 markers that predict future development of HCC) in blood using longitudinal data (both retrospective and prospective). Data are collected before participants develop HCC, and they are followed over time to see who develops HCC, and multiple time points of marker data are collected and stored over time prior to tumor onset. In addition, we will maintain and share a biorepository, and collaborate with other Centers in the Translational Research Network for Liver Cancer.",2018-09-14T12:09:00Z,2023-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-17-025,nofo_RFA-CA-17-025,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,WASHINGTON,DC,UNITED STATES,tlc
U01CA230694,Precision Risk Stratification and Screening for HCC among Patients with Cirrhosis in the United States,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)-related mortality in the U.S. is rapidly rising. Given the association between early detection and improved survival, screening using ultrasound +/- a serum biomarker, alpha fetoprotein (AFP), is recommended in at-risk individuals, including all patients with cirrhosis. However, most HCC patients are diagnosed at a late stage due to limitations in this strategy. Specifically, the strategy of ultrasound and AFP in all cirrhosis patients is inadequate because it ignores: 1) heterogeneity in risk between patients; 2) the poor accuracy of screening tests; and 3) the poor reliability of screening test performance between patients. The current “one-size-fits-all” approach to HCC screening leads to over-screening of low-risk cirrhosis patients and under-screening of high-risk patients, diluting the overall value of HCC screening. Our proposal's goal is to develop and evaluate a precision screening strategy for early stage HCC in patients with cirrhosis that matches the best screening tests to individual risk and screening test performance. We will leverage five patient populations (4 prospective cohorts and one case-control dataset) with a total of >6000 cirrhosis patients to evaluate and compare biomarker- and imaging-based models for HCC risk stratification and early detection. Specifically, we propose to: Aim 1: Validate and compare the performance of two risk stratification models to stratify cirrhosis patients with low-, intermediate- and high-risk of developing HCC Aim 2: Evaluate the performance of an abbreviated MRI protocol +/- serum biomarkers (including AFP, AFP- L3, and DCP) vs. ultrasound +/- serum biomarkers for early HCC detection in patients with cirrhosis Aim 3: Compare the cost effectiveness, using micro-simulation modeling, of a tailored screening strategy based on individual HCC risk and expected screening test performance to the current standard strategy of ultrasound and AFP in all patients with cirrhosis Our proposal leverages 5 distinct patient populations with >6000 cirrhosis patients, to compare biomarker- and imaging-based models for HCC risk stratification and early detection. We use these data to compare the effectiveness of a tailored screening strategy to the current strategy of ultrasound and AFP for all patients using micro-simulation modeling. Tailoring HCC screening efforts to individual risk and screening test performance moves beyond the current “one-size-fits-all” strategy and aligns HCC screening with the principles of precision medicine. Our proposed HCC screening strategy would maximize screening benefits and minimize screening harms for each patient, thereby optimizing overall HCC screening value in the United States. 2",2018-09-14T12:09:00Z,2024-07-31T12:07:00Z,RFA-CA-17-025,nofo_RFA-CA-17-025,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,DALLAS,TX,UNITED STATES,tlc
U01CA230705,The UCLA Center in Early Detection of Liver Cancer,"Project Summary Liver cancer is the second most frequent cause of cancer deaths. While cancer mortality has been declining overall, liver cancer mortality has been rising steadily due to the increasing incidence of obesity and alcohol abuse. This high mortality is mainly due to challenges in early detection. The goal of this project is to integrate molecular, imaging, and clinical information for the early detection of Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC). In the previous grant period, we developed a highly sensitive and cost-effective method of using cell-free DNA methylome for cancer detection, and have successfully validated the technology on a pilot HCC versus cirrhosis cohort. We have also established multiple clinical cohorts to study HCC detection, including a prospective longitudinal HCC screening cohort of patients with cirrhosis or HBV. The availability of blood samples, imaging scans, and comprehensive clinical information of patients in those cohorts provide us with unique opportunities to develop an integrated cancer detection method in the next funding period. The UCLA center includes a multidisciplinary team of clinical and translational researchers, and we have the following foci in the next funding period: (1) Continued expansion of multiple clinical cohorts to facilitate early detection of liver cancer. These cohorts shall provide an invaluable resource for the proposed research and other consortium-wide projects. (2) Continued experimental and computational development to refine the cfDNA methylome assay for early cancer detection. Experimentally, we will address a key challenge in cfDNA-based early cancer detection, namely, the limited cfDNA input, and computationally we will extract additional features, in addition to DNA methylation, from the assay data to enhance cancer detection. (3) We will integrate epigenomic, imaging, and clinical information into a complementary approach for the detection of HCC. We will build etiology-specific models for the multi- modality data to maximize performance. (4) We will contribute to collaborative consortium activities. We have been enthusiastically participating in collaborations within and beyond the consortium. We are an active enrollment site for the consortium-wide clinical cohorts, and we will collaborate with other centers to develop multi-omics and multi-modality markers to exploit the diagnostic potential of blood samples and imaging data.",2018-09-17T12:09:00Z,2028-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-17-025;RFA-CA-22-031,nofo_RFA-CA-22-031,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,LOS ANGELES,CA,UNITED STATES,tlc
U01CA230997,Risk Stratification for and Early Detection of Liver Cancer,"The Translational Research Center (TRC) includes a diverse team of clinical and translational researchers with a strong track record of working together to reduce hepatocellular cancer (HCC). The TRC uses data from a unique group of patients with cirrhosis who are being recruited from eight different sites throughout Texas (the TRC cohort). Our TRC cohort currently includes > 3700 patients with cirrhosis (>10,000 follow up surveillance visits and >190 HCC cases) who have diverse risk factors, including cured HCV and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. These patients are under routine HCC surveillance and their biological samples and clinical and radiological data for each visit is stored; it is a valuable resource for our research and other Consortium projects. We also launched a separate prospective cohort of patients with indeterminate liver nodules, which is a high risk and high priority group for HCC risk stratification and early detection. We are collecting surveys, clinical data, images and biospecimens from this cohort. The catalytic effects of our TRC are seen in the productivity of our junior investigators, who started innovative new initiatives and programs. Our work had a broad impact, including helping develop various society guidelines on HCC surveillance. Using data and the strong network of investigators and institutions collaborating with our TRC, we have already generated important data on risk factors and risk stratification for HCC. We also developed and demonstrated the framework for adding patient- and liver disease-related factors to new blood-biomarker profiles to improve early HCC detection. Here, we propose to build a novel imaging repository, including MRI images from our cohort. We will annotate and incorporate data from abdominal ultrasound reports for our TRC cohort using novel, scalable machine learning pipelines. We will also strengthen our data by appending information from the State cancer registries. Using data from different sources available to us, we will develop and test new personalized methods to stratify risk that blends information from clinical factors, blood-based biomarkers, and imaging (radiomics) to predict future development of HCC in patients with cirrhosis across diverse risk factors (Aim 1). We showed that the HCC Early Detection Screening (HES) algorithm, when combined with HCC blood-based biomarkers (AFP‐L3, DCP) in HES version 2.0 (HES v2.0), substantially improved early detection. We will validate and compare HES v2.0 with GALAD, another early detection algorithm, and evaluate their performance versus the current standard ultrasound-based surveillance (Aim 2). In Aim 3, we will develop a new mathematical model to look at how useful current and emerging biomarkers are for detecting HCC. We will also assess the risks, costs, and benefits of HCC surveillance using different cutoffs of existing and novel blood and imaging biomarkers. We will develop and disseminate an online Simulator so that other investigators can evaluate the potential clinical utility of HCC early detection biomarkers as potential surveillance tools. Our translational approach will have both an immediate and long-lasting impact on HCC-related morbidity and mortality.",2018-09-13T12:09:00Z,2028-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-17-025;RFA-CA-22-031,nofo_RFA-CA-22-031,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,HOUSTON,TX,UNITED STATES,tlc
U01CA231776,Bioinformatic-Chemical Approach to Credential Molecular Targets to Combat Rapid Chemo-Radiation Resistance in SCLC,"PROJECT ABSTRACT Limited stage small cell lung cancer (LS SCLC), the only curable form of SCLC, is remarkably sensitive to etoposide plus cisplatin combined with thoracic radiotherapy with response rates > 70%; however, therapy- refractory recurrence is common. LS SCLC has less than a 25% 5-year overall survival (OS) and ultimately a strategy for improving long-term SCLC outcomes needs to successfully target tumor cell populations that survive standard therapy and give rise to recurrent disease. There is, however, a considerable gap in understanding the specific mechanisms responsible for chemoradiotherapy resistance in SCLC. Our project is unique among the current portfolio of SCLC funded programs in that we have focused on chemoradioresistance to increase cure rates in LS SCLC. Recently, our work has suggested using patient- derived xenograft (PDX) models of SCLC may be an important tool to elucidate mechanisms of therapy resistance. This approach was remarkably successful, identifying a tolerable and strongly synergistic anti- SCLC interaction that led to a CTEP-approved trial based on our preclinical data - (NCI #10070; Study Chair: Hann). In this research program, we will test key hypotheses via three specific aims that will provide more mechanistic insights into the rapidly emergent chemoradiation resistance observed in LS SCLC. One central hypothesis of this proposal is that adaptive gene expression changes mediate rapid emergence of the chemoradiation resistance phenotype in LS SCLC. We have developed a novel chemoradiation treatment regimen with SCLC PDX models to facilitate these studies. Development and characterization of this novel model involves a unique collaboration between medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, bioinformaticians, medical physicists, veterinarians and molecular/cell biologists that is extremely well suited to develop an integrated program dedicated to resolving questions of SCLC chemoradioresistance. Finally, we have already identified novel gene targets that are correlated with SCLC chemoradioresistance. Our research program is organized as follows: Aim #1: Characterize natural history of response of experimental models of SCLC to chemoradiation in vivo. We will determine response rates and recurrence patterns of a panel of SCLC PDXs and transgenic mouse models. Aim #2: Characterization of molecular underpinnings of SCLC chemoradiation resistance. We will reconstruct gene regulatory networks and gene expression profiles associated with chemoradiation resistance and develop small-scale predictive classifiers for therapy response to be validated in follow-up studies. Aim #3: Pharmacologic and genetic validation of candidate genes for SCLC chemoradiation resistance in vitro and in vivo. We will validate our novel gene candidates for conferring chemoradiation resistance using pharmacologic and genetic approach with SCLC PDX-derived organoids and SCLC transgenic mouse models.",2018-09-03T12:09:00Z,2024-08-31T12:08:00Z,PAR-16-049,nofo_PAR-16-049,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,BALTIMORE,MD,UNITED STATES,sclc
U01CA231782,A Unified Machine Learning Package for Cancer Diagnosis,"The long-term goal of this project is to develop a unified software package for sharing image analysis and machine learning tools to improve the accuracy and efficiency of cancer diagnosis, thus aiding in improving the quality of both cancer research and clinical practice. Since diagnostic errors can cause altered treatment recommendations and significant patient harm, tools that semi-automate the diagnostic process to improve efficiency, reliability and accuracy are thus needed by both cancer researchers and clinical pathologists. Our work will produce a set of machine-learning tools to identify regions of interest (ROI), classify these regions into the full spectrum of diagnostic categories (ranging from benign, to pre-invasive/risk lesions, to invasive cancer), and culminate in the development of a unified software package for cancer diagnosis that can be shared among cancer researchers and clinicians. Our aims are: Aim 1: Regions of Interest. Produce 1a) a ROI finder classifier and associated tools for use by researchers or pathologists for automatic identification of potential ROIs on whole slide images of breast biopsy slides and 1b) a ROI analysis classifier and associated tools that can point out image regions that tend to cause misdiagnosis and produce suitable warnings as to why such regions may either be distractors or indicate cancer. Aim 2: Diagnosis. Produce a diagnostic classifier and associated tools that can not only suggest the potential diagnosis of a whole slide image, but can also produce the reasons for the diagnosis in terms of regions on the image, their color, their texture, and their structure. Aim 3: Dissemination. Develop a unified software package containing this suite of tools, so they can be easily shared and provided (standalone and through the existing PIIP platform) to both cancer researchers and clinical pathologists. In addition to specific classifiers for breast cancer research, we will provide the methodology to train related classifiers for other biopsy- diagnosed cancers, such as melanoma, prostate, lung, and colon cancer. Our highly innovative diagnostic tools will include our state-of-the-art (2017) feature extraction and machine learning methods as opposed to the generic image management tools of the current ITCR projects. Our classifiers were trained on a unique data set acquired in a carefully designed breast cancer research study, so they are immediately useful in the breast cancer domain, but designed to be easily retrained for other data sets and cancers. The addition of our unique multi-disciplinary team and these tools to the ITCR program will be an important aid to cancer research and will improve the process of diagnosis for clinicians.",2018-09-07T12:09:00Z,2022-08-31T12:08:00Z,PAR-15-332,nofo_PAR-15-332,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,SEATTLE,WA,UNITED STATES,itcr
U01CA231840,Network Analysis for a Data-Driven Approach to Cancer Care,"Project Summary The treatment of cancer has dramatically increased in complexity over the last several decades. Five-year relative cancer survival for all cancers has improved from 49% in the 1970’s to 68% in the 2000’s. This improved outlook is the result of careful and systematic evaluation of many drug combinations. However, cancer remains the second-leading cause of death in the United States and the leading cause of years of potential life lost. The explosion of treatment options for any given cancers has introduced a complexity of choice which is troubling for most clinicians. As just one example, there are at least 70 distinct regimens that have been evaluated in randomized trials for the postoperative (adjuvant) treatment of breast cancer. Given the number of possible drug combinations for nearly every subtype of cancer, a full comparison of all treatment options in the clinical trial setting can never be done. Adding to this complexity is that the very definition of cancer is changing, as genomic information regarding prognosis and treatment selection is brought into the clinic. This deluge of information has exceeded the cognitive capacity of cancer clinicians. One solution to this information problem is to increasingly rely on expert-driven guidelines or proscribed pathways. However, many cancer scenarios are already complex enough that guidelines do not, for example, provide ranked recommendations for treatment options. With few exceptions, published guidelines also rarely incorporate tumor biology. We have previously introduced new information theoretic methods to quantitatively compare the value of treatment regimens that have never been compared directly, as well as network analytic methods to begin to tie tumor biology into the clinical setting. Our group also has experience with advanced data extraction techniques and experience developing standardized software applications that can be utilized by clinicians and researchers. In response to PAR-15-332 (Early Stage Development of Informatics Technologies for Cancer Research and Management), we will: 1) Produce a comprehensive ontology of chemotherapy regimen concepts; 2) Determine a treatment preference hierarchy based on information theoretic network analysis, and present the results to clinicians and cancer researchers; and 3) Present preference hierarchy-modulated genomic treatment options. Our software will be evaluated on two common cancers: breast cancer and multiple myeloma and will be made freely available for non-commercial uses. We believe that the software developed as a result of this work will be widely applicable to a variety of cancer types, to the benefit of clinicians and the patients that they care for.",2018-09-18T12:09:00Z,2022-05-31T12:05:00Z,PAR-15-332,nofo_PAR-15-332,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,NASHVILLE,TN,UNITED STATES,itcr
U01CA231844,Genomic and Functional Identification of Chemotherapy Resistance Mechanisms in Small Cell Lung Cancer,"Project Summary Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is responsible for over 30,000 deaths each year in the United States alone. SCLC has a two-year survival rate of ~6% and unlike the other major subtypes of lung cancer, there are currently no targeted therapies approved for SCLC. SCLC is initially highly responsive to chemotherapy, but rapidly develops resistance leading to mortality in ~10 months. Clearly, a major unmet need for the treatment of SCLC is the identification of new therapeutic targets and treatment strategies to combat chemo-resistant disease. Our understanding of chemotherapy resistance mechanisms has been hampered by a lack of relapsed human SCLC tissue due to rare surgical resections. In addition, there have been few mouse models of the disease that exhibit short latencies and chemo-sensitivity. To address these challenges, we performed whole exome sequencing on relapsed SCLC from 30 patients. Relapse-specific genomic alterations in the WNT/APC/β-catenin pathway were identified in ~66% of relapsed SCLC suggesting that this pathway promotes chemo-resistance. Second, we developed a novel mouse model of SCLC driven by loss of Rb1, Trp53 and overexpression of Myc—three of the most common genetic alterations in the human disease. Mice develop SCLC within weeks that highly resembles the human disease at the level of histopathology, biomarker expression and chemo-sensitivity followed by relapse. This model will be a useful tool to test candidate chemotherapy resistance mechanisms and identify novel therapeutic targets that inhibit chemo-resistance. The objective of this study is to use this novel mouse model and comprehensive genomic analyses of primary and relapsed human SCLC to identify mechanisms of chemotherapy resistance and novel therapeutic targets to combat chemo-resistant disease. We hypothesize that activation of the WNT/β-catenin pathway promotes chemo-resistance in SCLC and that targeted inhibition of the pathway will inhibit chemo-resistant disease. We predict that expansion of our genomic and transcriptomic profiling will identify additional novel pathways involved in chemo-resistance. To test these hypotheses, we will: 1) identify recurrent pathway alterations in relapsed human and mouse SCLC using whole genome, exome, transcriptome and epigenome sequencing and 2) functionally determine whether canonical WNT/β-catenin signaling and other candidate pathways are necessary and sufficient for chemo-resistance in SCLC in vivo. This approach is innovative because we will employ unbiased comprehensive genomic and epigenomic analyses on relapsed human SCLC and a novel immune-competent mouse model of SCLC that recapitulates key features of the human disease. The WNT/β- catenin pathway is largely unexplored in SCLC. This research is significant because there are currently no targeted therapies approved for SCLC. A better understanding of the critical pathways driving chemo- resistance in SCLC will impact the treatment and survival of patients with this intractable disease.",2018-09-01T12:09:00Z,2024-08-31T12:08:00Z,PAR-16-049,nofo_PAR-16-049,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,SAINT LOUIS,MO,UNITED STATES,sclc
U01CA231851,Molecular mechanisms of SCLC initiation and detection in mice and humans,"Small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) is one of the deadliest cancers, a “recalcitrant” cancer for which there is no effective treatment except when the disease is diagnosed early. However, only a small fraction of patients are diagnosed early in disease. The greatest challenge to early diagnosis is that SCLC tumor cells typically acquire an exceptional mutation burden and metastasize early, so for most patients disease has spread beyond the lung at the time of diagnosis. The key to developing effective early diagnosis and treatment methods is to elucidate the earliest molecular and cellular events of tumor initiation to uncover ones that can be detected by screening during the premalignant phase of the disease. The goal of this proposal is to define the early, premalignant molecular and cellular events of SCLC, so that they can be detected early and destroyed before they become a deadly, untreatable disease. SCLC is a neuroendocrine cancer. The prominent cell of origin is pulmonary neuroendocrine (NE) cells, neurosensory and neurosecretory epithelial cells that sense and respond to the environment in the lung. Recently, a minor subpopulation of NE cells was found to have stem cell activity, proliferating, dispersing, and replenishing the surrounding bronchial epithelium following severe airway injury. Loss of tumor suppressors Rb and p53 constitutively activates the stem cell program within days of loss of the tumor suppressors, even in the absence of injury. In this proposal, a combination of genetics, cell culture, and single-cell genomics is used to systematically interrogate these stem cells at cellular resolution, both in healthy lungs and in the early, premalignant stage of SCLC. The goal is to define the molecular events immediately following loss of Rb and p53 that constitutively activate the stem cell program and initiate their transformation into cancer stem cells that spread, mutate, and escape immune destruction, and to identify the signals they secrete that might allow the tumors to be detected before they become deadly.",2018-09-19T12:09:00Z,2024-08-31T12:08:00Z,PAR-16-051,nofo_PAR-16-051,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,STANFORD,CA,UNITED STATES,sclc

U01CA231978,Systems analysis of aggressive prostate cancer pathology,"Project Summary Tissue pathology is a manifestation of the genomic aberrations that define cancer (i.e. stage, grade, type). In prostate cancer, the best prognostic marker is Gleason score, the composite tumor grading system that summarizes primary tumor morphology. Subsets of patients with localized disease inevitably develop metastases, a point where it is often too late for curative treatment. Thus, we propose to model and therapeutically target molecular subtypes that drive aggressive primary prostate cancer. We start from large, –omic datasets and use tissue pathology and gene expression as the readout of disease development. To evaluate the direct effect of molecular drivers of aggressive primary disease, we use a novel prostate stem cell, tissue recombination mouse model that recapitulates prostate development and tissue pathology. To model specific molecular subtypes, we will genetically engineer mouse prostate stem cells to introduce gene knockouts or Tet-regulated genes. These engineered cells will then be combined with fetal urogenital mesenchyme and engrafted under the mouse kidney capsule to produce prostate structures. We will evaluate tissue pathology and isolate regions of interest with aggressive tissue morphology (e.g., cribriform patterning) for RNA sequencing. Using this approach to model three mutually exclusive molecular subtypes, we can directly compare and contrasts gene expression and pathways changes to identify common and subtype- specific effects. Using these data, along with –omic data from patients, we will use two network-based computational models to identify novel therapeutic treatments and capture the systems-level gene regulation and functional relationships. The therapeutic predictions will be screened in vitro using engineered mouse and human cells with promising treatments being promoted for testing in the tissue recombination mouse model. Overall, through this project, we will study drivers of aggressive primary prostate cancer, characterize mechanisms of disease development, and identify pre-clinical pharmacological treatment strategies. Computational models and the prostate stem cells will be valuable resources for the CSBC and larger research communities.",2019-09-01T12:09:00Z,2024-08-31T12:08:00Z,PAR-16-131,nofo_PAR-16-131,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,Aurora,CO,UNITED STATES,csbc
U01CA232137,Multiscale systems biology modeling to exploit tumor-stromal metabolic crosstalk in colorectal cancer,"Project Summary: Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains one of the deadliest cancers in the United States, with a 5-year survival rate of 10% for patients with metastatic disease. Over 120,000 people are diagnosed with CRC each year, leading to approximately 50,000 deaths. Even with the current standard of care, CRC patients have a high rate of relapse, and resistance to therapy is a key contributor to their high morbidity and mortality. Interactions between tumor and stromal cells are a source of acquired drug resistance. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are a dominant cellular component of the tumor stroma and play a significant role in drug resistance by contributing to the altered metabolism that is a hallmark of CRC. Recent studies suggest reciprocal metabolic reprogramming among CRC cells and CAFs. However, questions still remain regarding the metabolic dependencies of these two cell populations in the context of treatment response. Thus, quantifying the collective cell dynamics (i.e. cooperation or competition) of tumor and CAF cells in their metabolic ecosystem may provide insight needed to develop optimal cancer therapies. Despite many computational models of colorectal cancer growth and progression, there is currently no quantitative spatiotemporal description of the interactions between colon cancer cells and stromal cells, or the metabolic dependencies of these two cell populations. The proposed research addresses this limitation by developing an experiment-based, multiscale computational model of tumor-stromal metabolic interactions in colon cancer. We hypothesize that exploiting tumor-stromal metabolic dependencies will enhance the effects of therapeutic strategies to inhibit tumor growth. We will test this hypothesis by using a systems biology approach and pursuing three aims that combine computational and experimental studies: (1) Develop computational models of intracellular metabolic pathways in CRC cells and CAFs that promote colon cancer proliferation; (2) Develop a spatial multiscale model of colon cancer cell growth, integrating the pathway models of tumor-CAF metabolic crosstalk; and (3) Identify and validate treatment strategies that exploit tumor and CAF metabolism. This work applies a systems biology approach comprised of novel mathematical frameworks across scales, quantitative imaging techniques, and physiologically-relevant preclinical models. We have assembled a dynamic team of Principal Investigators to successfully complete this project, integrating expertise in computational systems biology (lead by Finley) and modeling multicellular interactions in biochemical signaling environments (lead by Macklin), driven by cutting-edge high-throughput experimental data in realistic conditions (lead by Mumenthaler). As a result, this work will generate the first multiscale model that explicitly accounts for molecular interactions between tumor and stromal cells in the context of colorectal cancer. We will apply the model to identify novel strategies that inhibit tumor growth by exploiting the tumor-stromal cell metabolic interactions, and the model predictions will be validated experimentally.",2018-09-13T12:09:00Z,2024-08-31T12:08:00Z,PAR-16-131,nofo_PAR-16-131,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,Los Angeles,CA,UNITED STATES,csbc
U01CA232161,Rewiring of regulatory networks in breast cancer by transcription factor isoforms,"Project summary One of the ultimate goals of cancer systems biology is to generate predictive and dynamic models of tumorigenesis by identifying and quantifying all perturbed functional interactions in a cancerous cellular system. The central hypothesis of this CSBC U01 application is that, among the combined effects of multiple types of functional perturbations, those emerging from cancer-specific gene expression of alternative isoforms are crucial for tumorigenesis. Genome alterations such as amplification, deletion, translocations and mutations, are often considered primary events of cancer progression. However, cancer-specific isoforms resulting from alternative splicing, alternative sites of transcriptional initiation, and/or alternative transcriptional termination sites, have also been shown to have functional impact on tumorigenesis. In particular, changes in gene regulatory networks (GRNs) by transcription factor (TF) isoforms have been shown to play a major role in tumorigenesis and metastasis in multiple types of cancer. While a few examples of functional characterization of driver cancer-specific TF isoforms have been reported, what remains unclear is the extent to which differences in TF isoforms between normal and cancer tissue affect global GRNs and how such regulatory network rewiring leads to altered gene expression programs in cancer. Indeed, hundreds of differential TF isoforms have been identified between normal and cancer samples, but the vast majority remain uncharacterized at the functional level. In this project, we propose an initial step toward this long-term goal, which consists of characterizing and modeling the effect of large numbers of breast cancer-specific TF isoforms in the context of cancer interactome networks. We aim to combine network modeling and high-throughput systematic experimental strategies at the level of molecular protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions to predict cancer drivers and suppressors. The resulting hypotheses will be tested experimentally using various large-scale functional assays in breast cancer as a model system. As part of the experimental testing, we will establish state-of-the-art genome editing methodologies for testing the effects of isoform-specific perturbations on GRNs in mammalian cells. Altogether, this project will constitute an important step towards the long-term goal of contextualizing and functionalizing large numbers of TF isoforms implicated in breast cancer. Further, the lessons learned from the data analysis and integration will lead to the identification of novel cancer drivers and suppressors, the generation of mechanistic models of GRN rewiring in cancer, and provide a framework for the design of novel therapeutics.",2018-09-17T12:09:00Z,2024-02-29T12:02:00Z,PAR-16-131,nofo_PAR-16-131,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,BOSTON,MA,UNITED STATES,csbc
U01CA232216,Experimental-Computational Synthesis of Altered Immune Signaling in Breast Cancer,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This integrated experimental–computational proposal seeks to unravel the complexity of immune signaling networks in healthy individuals and patients with estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer (ER+ BC). Our goal is to identify and characterize, at a systems level, the dynamical flow of information through immune signaling networks in healthy individuals and ER+ BC patients and to understand how immune signaling defects at diagnosis reflect patients' immune responses, leading to different clinical outcomes. This work and its approach are motivated by our experience in immune signaling in cancer and our existing collaborations with oncologists and computational biologists at the City of Hope Cancer Center. We have shown that approximately 40% of ER+ BC patients harbor defects in their immune signaling network, specifically in signaling molecules called cytokines. Importantly, our preliminary data revealed major cytokine signaling abnormalities within immune cells from the peripheral blood of ER+ BC patients, which reflect immune activity within tumors and can predict cancer relapse years later. We believe that understanding how these cytokines interact with each other and other critical elements of the immune signaling network can ultimately lead to improved cancer treatments. Because the individual components of signaling networks interact in complicated and difficult-to-predict ways, we propose to apply a systems biology computational modeling approach. First, we propose to experimentally capture a rich data set of biological variables (molecular, genetic, and cellular data) using state-of-the-art technologies in peripheral blood collected from healthy people (Aim 1) and patients with ER+ BC (Aim 2). We will integrate these data into Bayesian networks, a way of modeling the data that will allow us to mathematically and statistically describe the relationships between cancer and measured variables. We will also perform high-dimensional histology and spatial image analysis of human ER+ breast tumors (Aim 3), then apply Bayesian networks and dynamical mathematical models to identify common immune features between tumor tissue (Aim 3) and peripheral blood (Aims 1 and 2), which we will also correlate with outcome. Impact and deliverables. This proposal will begin unraveling the complexity of the immune signaling network from a systems biology perspective. Significant outcomes of the proposed studies will include i) identification, at the systems biology level, of a prognostic and clinically relevant immune phenotype that is characterized by defects in signaling networks in ER+ BC, and ii) development of a data-driven, computational framework for the study of immune signaling and its defects as a dynamical system in cancer patients with such signaling defects. Our approach should be broadly applicable to other types of cancers and immunological diseases. Therefore, an important deliverable will be a computational systems biology data analysis toolkit to construct, interrogate, and dissect immune signaling networks that can be shared with other groups and applied to other diseases.",2019-09-16T12:09:00Z,2024-08-31T12:08:00Z,PAR-16-131,nofo_PAR-16-131,BECKMAN RESEARCH INSTITUTE/CITY OF HOPE,DUARTE,CA,UNITED STATES,csbc
U01CA232382,Eco-Evolutionary dynamics of NSCLC to immunotherapy: Response and Resistance,"Abstract Worldwide, Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) is the most common and among the most lethal of human cancers with about 2 million new cases per year and a 5 year survival for metastatic disease of about 1%. Fortunately, a number of new treatments have improved the lives of some patients with NSCLC. During the past decade, the Moffitt Thoracic Oncology Department has pioneered new strategies using immunotherapy for NSCLC. In almost 500 patients treated with immunotherapy at Moffitt, the response rate (CR, PR, and SD) is 30 to 45% (2, 3). Most responses are followed by evolution of resistance and progression but some patients in each category have experienced durable responses maintained for > 1 year (2). Our underlying hypothesis is that the observed results from immunotherapy can be improved with sufficient understanding of the evolutionary (cellular and molecular) and ecological (tissue) dynamics that govern response and resistance of NSCLC to immunotherapy. We have previously demonstrated that administration of cancer therapy can be optimized through evolutionary mathematical models that frame the complex, often non-linear underlying dynamics. To develop such models in immunotherapy of NSCLC, we will analyze a Moffitt NSCLC immunotherapy patient cohort all of whom were treated within an investigational protocol in which tumor biopsies are performed prior to therapy and after 6 weeks of immunotherapy. They also underwent repeated imaging with radiomic analyses and blood studies during the course of therapy, and many had biopsies at the time of progression. Retrospective analysis of this cohort will investigate the evolutionary (molecular, cellular) data as well as ecological (histological and radiological) dynamics that govern response and resistance to immunotherapy. These investigations will be supplemented from additional ex vivo studies in which tumor and immune cells obtained from resected primary tumors are dispersed in culture allowing the immediate response to immunotherapy agents to be assessed. We will also perform in vitro studies that dissect the wide range of cellular and tissue ecological engineering strategies available to NSCLC cells as well as the timescales of immunotherapy adaptation. Finally, we will test the predictive power of our developed mathematical models to use pre-therapy data to predict outcomes from monotherapy with PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors. We will then extend these models by integrating additional immunosuppressive mechanisms and test these models in a second clinical cohort treated with combinations of PD-LI and CTLA-4 checkpoint inhibitors.",2018-09-19T12:09:00Z,2023-08-31T12:08:00Z,PAR-16-131,nofo_PAR-16-131,H.

U01CA232758,B cell-dependent anti-tumor immunity in ovarian cancer,"ABSTRACT Within tumor beds, T and B cells often interact to form highly organized structures similar to lymph nodes, termed tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS), which are associated with better outcomes in many tumors. TFH cells are crucial for the formation of germinal centers and humoral responses, and our new data show that TFH cells become the main producers of CXCL13 and TNFS14/LIGHT upon vaccination. The assembly and maintenance of TLS should be therefore dependent on TFH responses. Our new data demonstrate that Special AT-rich sequence-binding protein-1 (Satb1) ablation specifically in T cells leads to enhanced TFH differentiation and augmented Ag-specific humoral responses, which is associated with concurrent ICOS and PD-1 de-repression. Accordingly, our central hypothesis is that LIGHT+CXCL13+ TFH cell formation and, subsequently, the orchestration of TLS in cancer, is governed by Satb1 silencing in CD4 T cells by both de-repressing ICOS in TFH cells and suppressing Foxp3+PD-1highCXCR5+ T follicular regulatory (TFR) cell formation through PD-1 up-regulation. Therefore, TGF-β paradoxically enhances the generation of TFH cells and the formation of TLS through Satb1 repression. In Aim 1, we will define the role of SATB1-dependent ICOS expression during TFH differentiation. Through ChIP-PCR and functional analysis of Satb1-competent vs. Satb1- deficient T cells in vivo, we will substantiate a novel epigenetic mechanism whereby the master genomic organizer Satb1 governs ICOS expression, leading to enhanced TFH differentiation in the absence of Satb1. In Aim 2, we will determine the role of SATB1 in TGF-β-driven, Treg-dependent TFH differentiation. Here, we will combine geentic manipulation and existing transgenic models to establish to what extent the mechanism of TGF-β-driven TFH differentiation is Satb1- and PD-1- dependent, in a manner that requires decreased TFR formation. In Aim 3, we will recapitulate the mechanisms leading to the formation and protective activity of TLS in vivo in ovarian cancer. By leveraging unique transgenic models, our ovarian cancer- specific CAR T cells and our viable single-cell suspensions from freshly dissociated ovarian carcinomas, we will define a novel TGF-β → Satb1 silencing → TFH cell formation axis driving relevant anti-tumor humoral responses. Our work will exert a profound effect in the field by elucidating how epigenetic programs controlled by SATB1 govern the generation of TFH cells at tumor beds in a TGF-β-dependent manner. Recapitulating these mechanisms in vivo will pave the way for more effective immunotherapies aimed to promote combined humoral and T cell responses through the orchestration of TLS in irresectable/metastatic tumors, and could lead to the identification of antibodies with anti-tumor activity spontaneously produced at tumor beds.",2018-09-20T12:09:00Z,2023-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-17-045,nofo_RFA-CA-17-045,H.

U01CA233056,Neoantigen Vaccination for Lynch Syndrome Immunoprevention,"Lynch syndrome (LS) is a genetic disease predisposing to colorectal cancer (CRC) that affects more than one million Americans. Germline mutations in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes, primarily MLH1 and MSH2, cause deficient DNA mismatch repair (dMMR) and LS. LS CRCs have exceptionally high numbers of small insertion/deletion frameshift and missense mutations. Elevated dMMR mutation rates cause some mutations to recurrently arise in tumors from different patients. For example, the human TGFβR2 gene has a poly(A) coding repeat, and the same “shared” frameshift mutation is recurrently identified in >60% of LS dMMR CRCs. Here, we will use state of the art tools to systematically delineate recurrent LS mouse and human pre-malignant neoantigens, test whether vaccination with frequently mutated “shared” immunogenic neoantigens reduces LS mouse CRC penetrance, and elucidate adaptive immune mechanisms for CRC immunoprevention. In Aim 1 we will comprehensively delineate frequently mutated recurrent neoantigens in Lynch syndrome mouse colorectal mucosa and adenomas. This will provide insights into pre-malignant colon dMMR immunoediting mechanisms, the timing and sequence of dMMR neoantigen appearance, and systematically delineate the most immunogenic recurrent shared dMMR neoantigen vaccine targets for LS mouse CRC immunoprevention. In Aim 2 we will test the hypothesis that recurrent neoantigen vaccination reduces mouse Lynch syndrome mismatch repair deficient epithelial cells in colon mucosa. This will give insights into the mechanism of dMMR colon mucosal immunoediting, and test the efficacy and safety of a dMMR recurrent neoantigen vaccine strategy using the earliest neoantigen mutations for LS immunoprevention. In Aim 3, we will test the hypothesis that recurrent neoantigen vaccination reduces mouse Lynch syndrome colorectal tumor burden. This will evaluate the efficacy and safety of a dMMR recurrent adenoma neoantigen vaccine strategy for Lynch syndrome immunoprevention and provide insights into the mechanisms of dMMR immunoediting. Finally, in Aim 4 we will systematically delineate Lynch syndrome patient adenoma recurrent neoantigens. This will delineate the most promising candidate recurrent neoantigens that can be used for LS patient tumor vaccine clinical trials and give insights into dMMR immunoediting mechanisms. Our overall goal is to develop effective, safe mechanism based neoantigen vaccination strategies for Lynch syndrome CRC immunoprevention.",2018-09-30T12:09:00Z,2024-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-17-046,nofo_RFA-CA-17-046,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,NEW YORK,NY,UNITED STATES,iotn
U01CA233074,Targeting alternative splicing for TCR discovery in small cell carcinomas,"ABSTRACT We present a collaborative immunotherapeutics discovery program that exploits alternative pre-mRNA splicing as a source of cancer-specific epitopes for T-cell receptor (TCR) therapy of small cell carcinomas of the prostate and lung. Small cell carcinomas arise from many different epithelial tissues but are generally aggressive, have no curative treatment, and carry a dire prognosis. Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is the most common subtype. Small cell prostate cancer (SCPC) is rare as a primary disease but is becoming increasingly common as a late-stage phenotypic transition in response to hormone-deprivation therapy. Emerging research indicates that despite their disparate tissues of origin, SCPC and SCLC are highly similar in behavior and molecular phenotype. This suggests effective targeted therapies could address both malignancies. Our strategy is to define cancer-specific epitopes created by alternative pre-mRNA splicing in small cell carcinomas and then use these targets to develop TCR-based therapeutics. Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapies targeting cell surface proteins have been developed for some hematological malignancies, but this strategy has been unsuccessful for epithelial tumors. The limited cancer specificity of the target epitope has led to significant on-target, off-tumor toxicities in human trials. We have chosen to pursue TCRs to expand the pool of available targets beyond the cell surface. We hypothesize that tapping into the additional proteomic diversity revealed by a detailed analysis of alternatively spliced exons will provide better targets. Our team of principal investigators includes experts in the computational biology of alternative splicing (Yi Xing), cancer cell biology and immunology (Owen Witte), and hematopoietic cell development and immunology (Gay Crooks). We are compiling RNA-Seq data on small cell cancers and normal tissues from public datasets and new human cell line models of SCPC & SCLC derived from benign cells by lentiviral transduction. This combined dataset serves as the foundation for our discovery effort. We plan to pair this with total proteomics analysis to identify spliced isoforms that affect protein composition. This data will be further integrated with immunopeptidomics assays that define the pool of peptides presented to the immune system by the target cancer cells. Epitopes derived from alternative splicing events that show high cancer specificity, protein expression, and predicted or observed epitope presentation will be prioritized for TCR development. We will use these epitopes to select TCRs from naïve human T-cell populations using a highly organotypic in vitro artificial human thymic culture system developed in the Crooks laboratory.",2018-09-21T12:09:00Z,2024-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-17-045,nofo_RFA-CA-17-045,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,LOS ANGELES,CA,UNITED STATES,iotn
U01CA233078,N-glycosylation and Immunotherapy for cancer,"Project Summary For decades, the treatment of cancer has relied on surgical resection, chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. Recently, a number of immune based therapies have provided promising new approaches for cancer treatment. These include checkpoint inhibitors that block T cell suppression (eg anti-PD-1), bi-specific antibodies that cross-link T cells to cancer cells (eg Bi-specific T cell engagers – BiTE) and T cells engineered to express antigen receptors specific to cancer cells (eg Chimeric Antigen Receptor T cells or CAR T). All three approaches induce T cell mediated killing of cancer cells. However, widespread development of bi-specific antibodies and CAR T cells is limited by the small number of known cell-surface proteins that are sufficiently specific to cancer to safely allow targeting by antibodies. This is particularly true for solid cancers, where unlike hematopoietic malignancies, loss of healthy cells cannot be readily replenished by stem cell progenitors. A solution to this issue is to target cancer specific glycan antigens rather than protein antigens. Indeed, altered glycosylation is a near universal feature of cancer and represent the most abundant and widely expressed cell surface cancer antigens, while also having limited or no expression in normal tissue. However, generation of monoclonal antibodies specific to complex carbohydrates has proven to be very challenging, greatly limiting their usefulness as targets for cancer immunotherapy. Here we propose to address these issues and develop a novel class of immunotherapeutics that target an N-linked carbohydrate antigen common to the vast majority of solid and hematopoietic cancers. We have termed these molecules as Glycan- dependent T cell Recruiter (GlyTR) technology. Critically, GlyTR technology does not utilize antibodies to target carbohydrate cancer antigens. Preliminary data demonstrates that the GlyTR bi-specific protein 1) specifically bound to both human CD3 and its N-glycan target, 2) robustly activated T cells only in the presence of cancer cells, 3) induced T cell dependent killing of cancer cells with an EC50 as low as 5pM, 4) inhibited in vivo growth of established colon cancer xenografts in humanized NSG mice and 5) did not trigger production of antibodies in mice. To further expand on this approach, the following Aims are proposed. Aim 1 will characterize human and mouse reactive GlyTR bi-specific proteins targeting N-glycans. Aim 2 will examine the efficacy and safety of GlyTR proteins targeting N-glycans using humanized NSG mice. Aim 3 will examine the efficacy and safety of GlyTR proteins targeting N-glycans using mice with a normal immune system. If successful, these experiments will provide proof of principal data for an entire new class of cancer killing immunotherapeutic's capable of targeting multiple solid and hematopoietic cancers with minimal toxicity.",2018-09-21T12:09:00Z,2024-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-17-045,nofo_RFA-CA-17-045,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,IRVINE,CA,UNITED STATES,iotn
U01CA233084,MUC1-C is a Target for Reversing Immune Evasion and Resistance to Immunotherapies,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Blockade of the PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint has advanced the treatment of patients with diverse types of solid tumors. However, PD-1/PD-L1 blockade has been limited by low response rates and limited durations of response in certain settings, such as non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), as well as ovarian, prostate and colorectal cancers. These findings are explained, at least in part, by the premise that the PD-1/PD-L1 axis is only one of a number of tumor immune suppressive mechanisms that require inhibition. Therefore, additional strategies are clearly needed to improve the immunotherapy of human cancers. In this respect, cancer cells activate a program of immune evasion involving, for example, induction of PD-L1 expression and the downregulation of effectors that promote innate and adaptive immune response. The discovery and targeting of such immune suppressive programs has had limited success to date, supporting a critical need for identifying signaling pathways that activate these programs. The MUC1-C oncoprotein is aberrantly overexpressed in human carcinomas and is associated with poor clinical outcomes. MUC1-C promotes the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and the cancer stem cell (CSC) state. Recent advances have demonstrated that MUC1-C also activates a program of immune evasion in human cancer cells that includes upregulation of PD-L1 expression and the suppression of immune effectors, such as IFN. In addition, targeting MUC1-C has been found to effectively reverse tumor immune evasion. These findings have emphasized the need for developing agents that target MUC1-C for the immunotherapy of human cancers. In this way, selective and potent antibodies generated against the MUC1-C extracellular domain are under development as an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) and for antibody- dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). In addition, a peptide inhibitor of the MUC1-C cytoplasmic domain has been developed in a nanoparticle formulation, based on the findings that this agent inhibits PD-L1 expression and activates anti-tumor T cells in the immune microenvironment. The MUC1-C-targeted agents will be studied in genetically-engineered mouse models (GEMMs) for anti-tumor activity, as well as effects on the immune microenvironment when used alone and in combination with PD-1/PD-L1 axis blockade. These studies will be integrated with assessment of MUC1-C expression in human tumors as a metric of the suppressive immune microenvironment. The overall goal will be to develop agents that target MUC1-C and are advanced to clinical evaluation as novel immunotherapeutics.",2018-09-20T12:09:00Z,2024-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-17-045,nofo_RFA-CA-17-045,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,BOSTON,MA,UNITED STATES,iotn
U01CA233085,Reprograming the tumor microenvironment to overcome multiple primary and acquired immune resistance mechanisms in ovarian cancer,"The goal of our studies is to generate robust and long-lasting tumor-specific T cell responses for durable tumor regression in patients with chemotherapy-resistant epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). Although immunotherapy using immune checkpoint blockade, adoptive T cell therapy, or oncolytic viruses has generated remarkable results in several other tumor types, long-term tumor control has been infrequent in EOC patients. Studies by our group have identified key stumbling blocks underpinning the limited efficacy of immunotherapy in EOC, which include: (i) insufficient expansion of tumor-specific T cells, (ii) tumor-derived CXCL12 production that recruits Tregs and MDSC within tumors, (iii) expression of PD1 and LAG3 marking severely dysfunctional tumor infiltrating T lymphocytes (TILs), (iv) compensatory upregulation of LAG3 upon blockade of PD1 and vice-versa, and (v) disorganized and tortuous tumor vasculature lacking adequate flow dynamics to support trafficking of anti-tumor T cells. While combinatorial immunotherapy strategies have the potential to overcome these immune resistance mechanisms in the tumor microenvironment (TME), they are often associated with unacceptably high rates of toxicities in patients. Our proposal addresses these stumbling blocks using innovative, clinically-translatable strategies to reprogram the TME and to identify mechanisms that drive or hinder T cell trafficking into ovarian tumors. We previously demonstrated blockade of the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis in the ovarian TME by intraperitoneal delivery of an oncolytic vaccinia virus expressing a CXCR4 antagonist (OV-CXCR4-Fc) reduced intratumoral accumulation of immunosuppressive mediators and stimulated spontaneous antitumor immunity to endogenous tumor antigens. OV-CXCR4-Fc also improved T cell trafficking. We will build on the multifaceted antitumor activity of OV-CXCR4-Fc by further “arming” with antagonists of PD1 and LAG3, the two co-inhibitory receptors we have shown mark severely dysfunctional TILs in EOC patients. In addition, we plan to uncover the molecular mechanisms by which OV-CXCR4-Fc enhances T cell migration and trafficking to overcome the ovarian tumor “vascular checkpoint”. We hypothesize that in vivo tumor destruction by OV engineered to express the CXCR4 antagonist and PD1/LAG3 inhibitors (OV-CXCR4-Fc-PD1/LAG3) will limit dampening of the immune response in the TME and induce a molecular signature that promotes trafficking and homing of tumor-specific T cells. To test our hypotheses, we propose the following specific aims: Aim 1. Determine the therapeutic synergy of arming OV-CXCR4-Fc with PD1/LAG3 inhibitors. Aim 2. Determine the mechanism by which OV-CXCR4-Fc promotes T cell trafficking in murine and human ovarian tumors. Aim 3.

U01CA233096,Cytokine immunotherapies for melanoma,"PROJECT SUMMARY Immunotherapies for cancer, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), have exhibited impressive efficacy for a broad spectrum of cancers, including melanoma. However, despite their potential to produce dramatic treatment responses, ICI have proven to be ineffective for most patients and tumor types. Consequently, there remains a need for new immunotherapies that are effective in patients who are resistant or non-responsive to current ICI. To this end, immune cytokines have potent immunostimulatory activities that make them attractive potential therapeutics. Compared to the effect of ICI to “tune” existing immune responses, cytokines can tap into powerful programs that can effectively “reprogram” immune cells and control their activation, differentiation, and proliferation. Among cytokines, Interleukin 18 (IL-18) is an appealing immunotherapeutic candidate given its ability to stimulate both adaptive and innate immunity through CD8+ T and NK cells, respectively. However, the activity of IL-18 is limited by an endogenous decoy receptor, IL-18BP, which is induced as part of a negative feedback loop by interferon gamma activity, reminiscient of the regulation of the PD-1:PD-L1 axis and suggesting that it may represent a “soluble immune checkpoint” in cancer. Using directed evolution, the Ring lab has created an engineered version of IL-18 that is fully capable of activating the IL-18 receptor, but impervious to inhibition by IL-18BP. This decoy resistant IL-18 (DR-18) is active as a mono-immunotherapy in preclinical mouse models, where it can induce complete and durable tumor regressions. DR-18 also synergizes with ICI (anti-PD-1) therapy and is associated with high cure rates and limited toxicity in this setting. Notably, DR-18 is also effective for the treatment of MHC class I deficient murine tumors, which are resistant to ICI treatment, consistent with the ability of IL-18 to also activate anti-tumor activity of NK cells. In order to better understand the mechanism of DR-18 immunotherapy and enable its translation into the clinic, we propose to leverage a comprehensive series of sophisticated, genetically-defined syngeneic mouse models of melanoma called YUMM and YUMMER that we have developed. We propose to more comprehensively evaluate our hypothesis that bypass of the IL-18BP checkpoint by DR-18 will enable responses in ICI-resistant tumors in two Aims: 1) Evaluation and optimization of DR-18 therapy in melanoma, and 2) Development of DR-18 for the treatment of ICI-resistant tumors. We will utilize techniques including single-cell RNA sequencing and quantitiative pathology to better characterize DR-18 responses in the tumor microenvironment over time. Results from murine experiments will be functionally validated in fresh, dissociated human melanoma specimens. We aim to begin clinical trials with human DR-18 in 2020; these aims are focused on understanding and optimizing DR-18 in anticipation of this work.",2019-09-20T12:09:00Z,2024-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-19-015,nofo_RFA-CA-19-015,YALE UNIVERSITY,NEW HAVEN,CT,UNITED STATES,iotn
U01CA233097,Epithelium-derived alarmins role in breast cancer immunoprevention,"Project Summary/Abstract: Advances in cancer immunology has led to the successful use of patients' own immune cells to combat metastatic cancers. However, the therapeutic potential of the immune system in eliminating premalignant cells and preventing their progression to invasive cancers is unclear. To determine the benefit of activating the immune system to prevent cancer development and recurrence, we study the immune pathways that lead to effective immune activation against early phases of breast cancer development. Breast cancer is the most common internal cancer and second cause of cancer deaths among women in the United States. Importantly, the individuals at high risk of developing breast cancer due to underlying genetic mutations and those with premalignant lesions can be clinically identified and treated. Therefore, discovering an effective approach to activate the patients' own immune system against early breast precursor lesions may yield a lasting memory that can prevent breast cancer development and recurrence in this high-risk population. Our previous studies have demonstrated that a skin-derived immune factor called thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) suppresses the early stages of skin and breast cancer development. We have been able to extend these finding to clinics through a randomized double-blind clinical trial in which we find TSLP induction to promote a robust immune activation against skin cancer precursors and their complete clearance. In order to determine the precise mechanism of TSLP-induced immune response against early premalignant cells in the breast, and to extend our findings to other similar immune factors in high-risk patients, we aim to (1) determine the immune cells and signals that target breast premalignant cells in response to TSLP, (2) investigate the role of other immune factors released by breast cells that can induce immune response to block breast cancer development, and (3) determine the factors that are driving the immune response in the breast glands of patients with genetic mutations and utilize them for induction of an optimal immune response against early breast cancer. The outcomes of the proposed research will establish a foundation for the use of the immune system in blocking breast cancer development and provide novel therapeutic targets for breast cancer immunoprevention.",2018-09-30T12:09:00Z,2024-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-17-046,nofo_RFA-CA-17-046,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,BOSTON,MA,UNITED STATES,iotn
U01CA233100,Molecular and immune drivers of immunotherapy responsiveness in prostate cancer,"PROJECT SUMMARY Despite recent advances in treatment, metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) remains incurable, and approximately 30,000 men die of this disease yearly. Advances in immunotherapy with drugs targeting immune checkpoints have raised hopes that these agents will improve outcomes for mCRPC patients. While initial studies of immune checkpoint blockade have been unsuccessful, emerging evidence suggests a subset of prostate cancer (PCa) patients can respond, although the mechanisms of PCa immunotherapy response and resistance are incompletely characterized. Work in other immunotherapy responsive malignancies has found several predictive immune and tumor-intrinsic properties that contribute to response, but the extent to which these (or other) features are operant in PCa is largely unknown. For example, we recently identified mutations in a chromatin remodeling complex that mediates immunotherapy response through T cell interactions in solid tumors, and in parallel discovered a previously unknown PCa genomic subclass defined by mutations in these same chromatin remodelers. These findings indicate that tumor-intrinsic epigenetic dysregulation may also interact with the immune system to modulate PCa immunotherapy responsiveness. The overarching hypothesis of this project is that multiple immune and tumor- intrinsic properties mediate PCa interactions with the immune system, and these interactions can be modified through selective targeting in combination with checkpoint blockade to expand the therapeutic potential of immunotherapy in PCa. We will leverage our team's deep experience in clinically grounded molecular characterization and preclinical models that can test immunotherapy combinations in PCa to define the processes that govern the immunotherapy landscape in PCa. The proposed specific aims are: 1) Define the systemic and infiltrating immune states in PCa associated with clinical response to checkpoint blockade; 2) Establish the immunologic impact of chromatin dysregulation and inhibition in PCa; and 3) Determine the impact of existing DNA damaging agents for sensitizing PCa to PD-1 blockade. This proposal leverages the extensive, novel, and complementary resources at both Dana-Farber/Broad Institute and University of California, San Francisco, led by highly collaborative investigators and an international scientific team, to address the hypotheses outlined herein. Through a combination of functional, molecular, and clinical approaches inherent in these studies, our team is poised to identify mCRPC cohorts that may benefit from this treatment paradigm, determine strategies to augment the use of checkpoint inhibitors in this disease, and mechanistically define the immune and tumor-intrinsic defects that drive immunoresistance in PCa. Broadly, this project will provide a unique approach for the Immuno-Oncology Translation Network (IOTN) community and enable discovery of anti-cancer immunotherapies strategies for PCa that may have larger relevance across the IOTN network and collaborating members of the Cancer Immunotherapy Consortium.",2018-09-19T12:09:00Z,2023-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-17-045,nofo_RFA-CA-17-045,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,BOSTON,MA,UNITED STATES,iotn
U01CA233102,Immunomodulation of the Tumor Microenvironment with Molecular Targeted Radiotherapy to Facilitate an Adaptive Anti-Tumor Immune Response to Combined Modality Immunotherapies,"ABSTRACT We are developing a combined modality therapeutic approach to eradicating metastatic cancers that are immunologically “cold” and do not respond to immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI). Using an “in situ vaccine” regimen consisting of 12 Gy focal external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) and intratumoral (IT) injection of tumor-specific antibody (mAb) + IL2, we have eradicated solitary, large, cold syngeneic tumors in mice. This in situ vaccine converts the targeted tumor into a focus of enhanced tumor antigen presentation resulting in increased T-cell infiltration and potent T-cell memory. However, the presence of an identical but untreated second tumor (2°) on a mouse’s opposite flank inhibits the effect of this treatment, preventing eradication of the primary (1°) tumor treated with EBRT + IT mAb-IL2. In this setting, the untreated 2° tumor causes tumor- specific immune unresponsiveness to EBRT + IT mAb-IL2 at the 1° tumor. We refer to this as concomitant immune tolerance (CIT). We can overcome CIT, and eliminate both tumors by giving IT mAb-IL2 to the 1° tumor and EBRT to both the 1° and 2° tumors. Delivering as little as 2 Gy EBRT to the 2° tumor can overcome CIT. Clinically, delivery of EBRT (even low dose) to all sites of metastatic disease is problematic, but this can effectively be achieved using molecular targeted radiation therapy (MTRT). MTRT is increasingly entering clinical oncology practice and our UW team has led preclinical and clinical testing of a novel class of MTRT using alkylphosphocholine (APCh) analogs that selectively deliver radiation to cancers in vivo. These show tumor-selective uptake in virtually all mammalian tumor cells and tumor locations tested (including > 90 tumor lines and in patients across various clinical trials). In a syngeneic murine melanoma model, we have observed a potent synergy between systemically administered ICI and MTRT delivered using our next-generation APC analog, 90Y-NM600. In a project that builds upon the ongoing collaborative progress of our multidisciplinary team, we will now systematically optimize the potency of combining MTRT with immunotherapy to enhance the immune response against immunologically cold tumors. In murine models, we will: 1) expand on preliminary data showing potent synergy with the combination of MTRT and ICI, 2) evaluate the capacity of MTRT to overcome CIT and enhance systemic anti-tumor immune response in the setting of multiple tumors where one is treated with in situ vaccine (EBRT + IT mAb-IL2) alone or in combination with ICI. Because murine models do not replicate the size and spatial distribution of human metastatic cancer and because these factors strongly influence the dosimetry of MTRT, we will test the immunomodulatory effects of MTRT + in situ vaccine in large breed companion canines (pet dogs) with naturally occurring metastatic melanoma. The insights and treatment regimens developed in these studies should enable rapid translation to clinical testing in patients and potentially for any type of metastatic cancer.",2018-09-18T12:09:00Z,2023-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-17-045,nofo_RFA-CA-17-045,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,MADISON,WI,UNITED STATES,iotn
U01CA235625,Employing CRISPR inactivation screening and in vivo models towards improving treatments for SCLC,"SUMMARY With a lack of druggable oncogenic mutations in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and no approved targeted therapies, we need to identify new treatment approaches for SCLC. In this proposal, we apply whole genome CRISPR inactivation screens to identify genes that are essential for SCLC broadly, or for key genetically defined subsets. We then determine whether pharmacologic inhibition of identified hits also results in selective killing of SCLC cells. We apply in vivo systems including patient derived xenograft (PDX) and genetically engineered mouse models to test pharmacologic inhibitors of key targets identified in these genetic screens. Aim 1 will focus on a pathway that we already identified using CRISPR inactivation screens to be essential for Rb/p53-mutant SCLC cells. Components of a NEDD8/RBX1 pathway, controlling Cullin activity and protein ubiquitylation, were essential for SCLC cells. Pharmacologic inhibition of NEDD8 activating enzyme (NAE) using MLN4924 in patient derived xenograft (PDX) models confirmed reliance of SCLC cells on this pathway. Excitingly, we identified examples of exceptional responses to MLN4924 in some PDX models. Aim 1: Apply in vivo models to direct NEDD8 inhibition to subsets of SCLC most likely to respond. Here, we explore the potential for inhibiting the NEDD8 pathway in SCLC. We will combine NAE inhibition with cisplatin-etoposide chemotherapy and determine whether durable responses result. Some SCLC PDX models exhibited exquisite sensitivity to NAE inhibition; we will identify underlying mechanisms and genetic features of super-responding PDX models that could be used to help predict exceptional responders. We will determine whether NAE inhibition should be directed to all SCLC patients, or to key subsets, and whether this approach augments response to chemotherapy. MLN4924 is already being tested in clinical trials for other cancer types and this work could rapidly lead to clinical trials in SCLC. Aim 2: Apply CRISPR inactivation screens to identify new therapeutic targets for SCLC. This Aim will extend our CRISPR inactivation screens to include mouse SCLC cell lines with key driver mutations beyond Rb/p53, including Pten, Crebbp and Mycl. Our approach takes advantage of the fact that while human SCLC has an extremely high mutational burden, leading to extensive heterogeneity among SCLC with a given driver mutation, mouse SCLC with defined driver alterations are more homogenous, increasing signal to noise in identifying vulnerabilities. We will identify dependencies in genetically-defined subsets of SCLC and will test inhibitors of identified druggable targets in PDX and GEM models that harbor defined genetic alterations. We leverage available mouse models and derived cell lines, along with a bank of genetically annotated PDX models, studied in vivo and ex vivo, to identify and evaluate completely new ways to target key genetic subsets of SCLC.",2019-03-08T12:03:00Z,2024-02-29T12:02:00Z,PAR-16-049,nofo_PAR-16-049,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER CENTER,Seattle,WA,UNITED STATES,sclc
U01CA237711,Informatics resources for liquid biopsy research,"Abstract A liquid biopsy is a non-invasive alternative to surgical biopsies which enables doctors to discover a range of information about a tumor through non-solid biological tissue, primarily blood. cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in human blood has emerged as an ideal source of genetic information for cancer detection and monitoring. cfDNA fragments are released by dying cells into the blood stream, including circulating tumor DNA that are released by tumor cells. In principle, tumor cfDNA contains genetic and epigenetic alterations identical to the tumor cells they originate from. These molecular alterations include (but not limited to) single nucleotide variations (SNV), structural variations, copy number variations, and DNA methylation changes. Next generation sequencing has been extensively used in “liquid biopsy” for targeted or genome-wide profiling of cfDNA. Given the inherent nature of cfDNA as a mixture of DNA fragments released from all possible cells in the body, and given the demand of sensitivity and specificity in detecting the tiny fraction of the ctDNA, specific bioinformatics tools are needed. However, currently no user-friendly and comprehensive bioinformatics tools exist to facilitate information extraction from cfDNA sequencing data. Given the enormous potential of cfDNA- based liquid biopsy in personalized medicine, this is an urgent demand to match. This proposal aims to match this need. Specifically, we will develop R-workflows for the analysis of cfDNA genomic and epigenomic sequencing data. We will extensively document the software toolkit, and provide detailed online manual so that non-expert users can easily learn and use all its functionalities.",2019-09-16T12:09:00Z,2023-08-31T12:08:00Z,PAR-15-332,nofo_PAR-15-332,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,LOS ANGELES,CA,UNITED STATES,itcr
U01CA238475,Predictive Modeling of the EGFR-MAPK pathway for Triple Negative Breast Cancer Patients,"The EGFR-MAPK pathway is a key signaling pathway in human Triple Negative Beast Cancers (TNBC). We propose to leverage genomic and proteomic data from a rich animal model system, and 2 human clinical trials, to build predictive models of the EGFR-MAPK signaling pathway activity for TNBC patients. The heterogeneity of TNBC has hindered previous development of predictive pathway-based computational models because most approaches are based on experimental data from a single cell line or animal model that is then extrapolated to fit multiple tumor subtypes. Our approach is to use a diverse experimental model system that reflects the heterogeneous disease subtypes, and then use two distinct and complementary methods to build the computational model. We will simultaneously use mechanistic and statistical modeling approaches, at a variety of scales, that incorporate data from drug treated tumors and cell lines, assayed for gene expression, DNA copy number, DNA mutations, and protein kinome activity. Lastly, we will test these computational models on human tumors to evaluate their predictive performance.",2019-06-01T12:06:00Z,2024-05-31T12:05:00Z,PAR-16-131,nofo_PAR-16-131,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,CHAPEL HILL,NC,UNITED STATES,csbc
U01CA238720,Identification of adaptive response mechanisms in breast cancer by information theory and proteomics,"SUMMARY Over the past decade the accumulation of large-scale systems level data sets has occurred at an accelerating pace. Unfortunately, to date this massive accumulation of biological and medical information has rarely translated into truly efficacious therapies that dramatically alter the course of disease. Clearly new informatics approaches are needed that will enable the identification of transformative therapeutics. The central goal of this proposal is to develop an experimental-theoretical approach that defines, with high accuracy, the altered protein network structures present in each cancer malignancy. We propose to integrate quantitative mass spectrometry- based protein and protein phosphorylation measurements with surprisal analysis, a thermodynamic-based information theory approach, to resolve altered protein network structure in each malignancy. An altered network in each patients' tumor may comprise several distinct, sometimes rewired, protein subnetworks that drive the molecular imbalance in cancer tissue. Identification of unbalanced subnetworks will highlight molecular nodes that will be targeted in each patient to either restore the basal, non-transformed state or to decrease tumor cell viability. To demonstrate the ability of this approach to define unbalanced subnetworks and their associated therapeutic targets, the proposal is divided into three phases with increasing complexity and physiological relevance. In the first phase, RTK networks in breast cancer cell lines representing different subtypes will be stimulated with natural ligands to induce well characterized unbalanced processes to validate the ability of surprisal analysis to identify these networks. In the second phase, unbalanced processes present in the basal, unstimulated state of each cell line will be defined. Therapeutic targeting of these processes, alone or in combination, at high and low dose, will be performed to assess the effect of complete vs. incomplete inhibition. Unbalanced processes mediating the development of therapeutic resistance during long-term low- dose treatment will be quantified at various time points to predict combination therapies to abrogate resistance. Finally, surprisal analysis will be used to identify unbalanced processes associated with chemotherapeutic resistance in vivo in triple negative breast cancer patient derived xenograft tumors. Nodes in these imbalanced networks will be targeted to decrease tumor viability. Combination with chemotherapy may further sensitize tumor cells to treatment. Through these efforts we aim to demonstrate the ability of this combined proteomic- surprisal analysis strategy to rationally design, with high-precision, patient-specific drug cocktails that prevent drug resistance development.",2019-06-01T12:06:00Z,2024-05-31T12:05:00Z,PAR-16-131,nofo_PAR-16-131,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,CAMBRIDGE,MA,UNITED STATES,csbc
U01CA238728,Systems analysis of cell-cell communication networks and immune activity in the melanoma tumor microenvironment,"PROJECT SUMMARY Understanding the dynamic cell-cell communication networks that establish immunological activity in the tumor microenvironment (TME) would transform therapeutic strategies to help cancer patients that are unresponsive to checkpoint inhibitors (CPIs). To this end, the overall objective of this proposal is to determine networks of intercellular secreted signals that distinguish ineffective tumor-immune responses from effective ones in order to identify new targets to improve efficacy of cancer immunotherapy (CIT). To achieve this objective, extensive single-cell analysis will be performed on mouse models of melanoma and samples from human melanoma patients in response to CPI-targeting of T cells, and CITs targeting tumor associated monocytes and macrophages (TAMs). These data will be computationally analyzed to construct cell-cell interaction networks between stromal, tumor, and immune cells to identify interactions that maintain immunosuppressive TMEs, predict how to target them, and test these predictions experimentally. The central hypothesis tested in this proposal is that intercellular signaling networks between TAMs and other cells in the TME are central to suppressing immune activity, and that TAM-mediated networks are critical to reestablishing an effective TME immune response, especially in cases of CPI resistance due to inadequate T cell responses. The rationale for the proposed research is that identifying cell-cell interactions that distinguish immunosuppressive versus immunosupportive TMEs will serve as a roadmap of new targets to test in unresponsive tumors. Aim 1 will develop computational models that can distinguish between an ineffective versus effective anti-tumor immune response. These models will be developed by constructing intercellular networks of receptor-ligand interactions from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and pathology data in growing and regressing murine and human melanoma tumors. The models will be used to identify targets mediating cell-cell interactions that will be validated experimentally. The objective of Aim 2 will be to determine how the functional plasticity of macrophages and other myeloid cells contributes to an immunosuppressive TME in mice and human melanomas. Interactome maps will be expanded to identify interactions between myeloid cell subsets and other cell types in the tumor over time and with treatment. The proposed research is innovative because, rather than focusing solely on isolated end points (e.g., T cell infiltration), it will identify the network of intercellular communication that stabilizes those endpoints. With respect to cancer systems biology, the proposed research is innovative because it will combine new computational methods–for defining cell subsets and network interactions from scRNA-seq data and constructing predictive classification models–with syngeneic mouse melanoma models and human patient samples that are ideally suited to evaluate CIT responses. The proposed research is significant because it will redefine the hallmarks of immune activity in the TME as emergent properties of multiple cell-cell interactions that can be pharmacologically targeted to design immunotherapies that will be effective on non-responding patients.",2020-07-01T12:07:00Z,2025-06-30T12:06:00Z,PAR-19-287,nofo_PAR-19-287,YALE UNIVERSITY,NEW HAVEN,CT,UNITED STATES,csbc
U01CA239055,"HistoTools:  A suite of digital pathology tools for quality control, annotation and dataset identification","ABSTRACT: Roughly 40% of the US population will be diagnosed with some form of cancer in their lifetime. In a majority of these cases, a definitive cancer diagnosis is only possible via histopathologic confirmation using a tissue slide. Increasingly, these slides are being digitally scanned as high-resolution images for usage in both clinical and research digital pathology (DP) workflows. Our group has been pioneering the use of deep learning (DL), a form of machine learning, for segmentation, detection, and classification of various cancers using digital pathology images. DL learns features and their associated weighting from large datasets to maximally discriminate between user labeled data (e.g., cancer vs non-cancer, nuclei vs non-nuclei); a paradigm known as “learn from data”. Unfortunately, this paradigm makes DL especially sensitive to low quality slides, noise induced by small errors in the manual user labeling process, and general dataset heterogeneity. As many groups do not intentionally account for these problems, they learn that successful employment of DL technologies relies heavily on explicitly addressing challenges associated with (a) carefully curating high quality slides without preparation or scanning artifacts, (b) obtaining a large precise collection of annotations delineating objects of interest, and (c) selecting diverse datasets to ensure robust classifier performance when clinically deploying the model. To address these challenges we propose HistoTools, a suite of three modules or “Apps”: (1) HistoQC examines slides for artifacts and computes metrics associated with slide presentation characteristics (e.g., stain intensity, compression levels) helping to quantify ranges of acceptable characteristics for downstream algorithmic evaluation. (2) HistoAnno drastically improves the efficiency of annotation efforts using a combined active learning and deep learning approach to ensure experts focus only on regions which are important for classifier improvement. (3) HistoFinder aids in selecting suitable training and test cohorts to guarantee that various tissue level characteristics are well balanced, leading to increased reproducibility. Our team already has working prototypes of HistoQC (100% concordance with a pathologist, evaluated on n>1200 slides) and HistoAnno (30% efficiency improvement during annotation tasks). In this U01, we seek to further develop and evaluate HistoTools in the context of enhancing two companion diagnostic (CDx) assays being developed in our group. First, we will use HistoTools to quality control and annotate nuclei, tubules, and mitosis for improving our CDx classifier for predicting recurrence in breast cancers using a cohort of n>900 patients from completed trial ECOG 2197. Secondly, HistoTools will be employed for quality control and identification of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and cancer nuclei towards improving our CDx classifier for predicting response to immunotherapy in lung cancer using the n>700 patients from completed clinical trials Checkmate 017 and 057. These tools will build on our existing open source tool repository to aid in real-time feedback and dissemination throughout the ITCR and cancer research community.",2019-03-20T12:03:00Z,2023-02-28T12:02:00Z,PAR-15-332,nofo_PAR-15-332,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,CLEVELAND,OH,UNITED STATES,itcr
U01CA239258,Enhancing cell therapy for brain tumors,"ABSTRACT Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most lethal primary brain cancer, with standard treatments based on surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy promoting an overall survival of approximately 15 months. This has led to a resurgence of interest in immune-based approaches. While augmenting immunity has been successful in other malignancies like melanoma and leukemia/lymphoma, their efficacy in treatment of brain tumors has been very limited. Tumor antigen heterogeneity, limited number of infiltrating lymphocytes at the tumor site, and failure of checkpoint inhibitor drugs to cross the blood brain barrier all represent major obstacles to effective immune-therapies in GBM. Altered immunity in patients with GBM further contributes to the poor prognoses of these tumors and their relative resistance to vaccine and checkpoint inhibitors. Utilizing healthy donor immune cells in the form of adoptive cell therapy may offer a more effective alternative. However, limited information is available on the properties of effector populations that would exert effective anti-tumor activity in the brain. Pioneering work by Dr. Rick Jones at Johns Hopkins University utilizing haploidentical donor transplant (haplo-BMT) for brain tumors offers an opportunity to test kinetics of infused healthy donor immune cells in this patient population, providing a glimpse of what donor immune cells can do against brain tumors. Previous experiences with haplo-BMT suggest that effector cells of the innate immunity – natural killer cells (NKs) and invariant natural killer T cells (iNKTs) – mediate anti-tumor activity with decreased frequency of relapse. Innate immune cells are also potentially advantageous in the brain tumor setting, which affords very little tolerance for the adverse events associated with (for example) CD19-CAR T cell based-therapies. Finally, both iNKT and NK cells can actively migrate to the site of GBM following the CCL2 gradient, the chemokine released by tumor cells and the surrounding tumor associated macrophages (TAM). Dr. Savoldo at University of North Carolina has unique expertise in the development of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) transduced T cells and iNKT cells and Dr. Bollard at Children's National has extensive experience with the genetically modified T cells and NK cells. Hence, in this collaborative proposal we hypothesize that nontolerized innate immune cells (NKs and iNKTs) derived from healthy donors will promote anti- tumor immunity in patients GBM, and may be developed as effective cellular therapies. This overarching hypothesis will be tested in 3 Specific Aims where Dr. Jones (Aim 1) will compare the cellular signatures of iNKTs and NK cells isolated from healthy donors versus patients with GBM. In Aim 2, Dr. Savoldo and the UNC team will evaluate the anti-tumor efficacy of healthy donor iNKT and NK cells modified to express an anti- B7H3 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) and in Aim 3, Drs. Bollard and Cruz at CNMC overcome the inhibitory tumor microenvironment in GBM by targeting immune suppressive tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) and TGFβ.",2018-09-30T12:09:00Z,2024-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-17-045,nofo_RFA-CA-17-045,CHILDREN'S RESEARCH INSTITUTE,WASHINGTON,DC,UNITED STATES,iotn
U01CA242871,The Federated Tumor Segmentation (FeTS) platform: An intuitive tool facilitating secure multi-institutional collaboration,"ABSTRACT: Accurate segmentation of solid tumors is challenging, due to their heterogeneous shape, extent, and location, as well as their appearance variation caused by the diversity of medical imaging. Manual annotation is tedious, prone to misinterpretation, human error, and observer bias. All these factors hinder further image analysis towards understanding tumor radio-phenotypes, predicting clinical outcomes, and monitoring progression patterns. Computational competitions have been seeking optimal advanced computational segmentation algorithms (ACSAs) for specific abnormalities, by pooling multi-institutional data together and benchmarking ACSAs from international groups. Along these lines, we have been successfully leading the organization of the International Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) challenge, since 2012, towards a publicly-available pooled dataset of 542 multi-parametric MRI scans of glioma patients from 19 institutions. In the summarized analysis of all BraTS results, we have shown that although individual ACSAs do not outperform the gold standard agreement across expert clinicians, their fusion does outperform it, in terms of both accuracy and consistency across subjects. Towards the wider application of these ACSAs, in 2017 we created the BraTS algorithmic repository to make available Docker containers of individual ACSAs, created by BraTS participants. However, fusion of these ACSAs is still out of reach for clinical researchers, as there is no graphical user interface (GUI) to facilitate it, and execution of such algorithms requires substantial computational background by the user. Furthermore, although competitions such as BraTS have shown promise, they cannot easily scale due to the requirement of pooling patient data from multiple institutions to a single location, that often faces legal, privacy, and data-ownership concerns. These concerns motivate distributed learning solutions, where the data are always retained within their institutions. We have been investigating such solutions to avoid the current paradigm of multi-institutional collaboration, i.e., data-sharing, and considering their potential multi-institutional adoption, with respect to privacy, scalability, and performance, we found federated learning (FL) to be most appropriate. In FL, each institution trains a model and shares it (without patient data) with an aggregation server, which then integrates institutional models in parallel and distributes back a consensus model. In this proposal, we focus on developing the open- source Federated Tumor Segmentation (FeTS) platform, which with a user-friendly GUI will aim at i) bringing pre- trained models of various ACSAs and their fusion closer to clinical experts, and ii) allowing secure multi- institutional collaborations via FL to improve these pre-trained models without sharing patient data, thereby overcoming legal, privacy, and data-ownership challenges. Successful completion of this project will lead to an easy-to-use potentially-translatable tool enabling easy, fast, objective, repeatable and accurate tumor segmentation, without requiring a computational background by the user, and while facilitating further analysis of tumor radio-phenotypes towards accelerating discovery.",2019-09-05T12:09:00Z,2023-08-31T12:08:00Z,PAR-15-332,nofo_PAR-15-332,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,PHILADELPHIA,PA,UNITED STATES,itcr
U01CA242879,Distributed Learning of Deep Learning Models for Cancer Research,"Project Summary Deep learning methods are showing great promise for advancing cancer research and could potentially improve clinical decision making in cancers such as primary brain glioma, where deep learning models have recently shown promising results in predicting isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation and survival in these patients. A major challenge thwarting this research, however, is the requirement for large quantities of labeled image data to train deep learning models. Efforts to create large public centralized collections of image data are hindered by barriers to data sharing, costs of image de-identification, patient privacy concerns, and control over how data are used. Current deep learning models that are being built using data from one or a few institutions are limited by potential overfitting and poor generalizability. Instead of centralizing or sharing patient images, we aim to distribute the training of deep learning models across institutions with computations performed on their local image data. Although our preliminary results demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, there are three key challenges to translating these methods into research practice: (1) data is heterogeneous among institutions in the amount and quality of data that could impair the distributed computations, (2) there are data security and privacy concerns, and (3) there are no software packages that implement distributed deep learning with medical images. We tackle these challenges by (1) optimizing and expanding our current methods of distributed deep learning to tackle challenges of data variability and data privacy/security, (2) creating a freely available software system for building deep learning models on multi- institutional data using distributed computation, and (3) evaluating our system to tackle deep learning problems in example use cases of classification and clinical prediction in primary brain cancer. Our approach is innovative in developing distributed deep learning methods that will address variations in data among different institutions, that protect patient privacy during distributed computations, and that enable sites to discover pertinent datasets and participate in creating deep learning models. Our work will be significant and impactful by overcoming critical hurdles that researchers face in tapping into multi-institutional patient data to create deep learning models on large collections of image data that are more representative of disease than data acquired from a single institution, while avoiding the hurdles to inter-institutional sharing of patient data. Ultimately, our methods will enable researchers to collaboratively develop more generalizable deep learning applications to advance cancer care by unlocking access to and leveraging huge amounts of multi-institutional image data. Although our clinical use case in developing this technology is primary brain cancer, our methods will generalize to all cancers, as well as to other types of data besides images for use in creating deep learning models, and will ultimately lead to robust deep learning applications that are expected to improve clinical care and outcomes in many types of cancer.",2019-09-16T12:09:00Z,2022-08-31T12:08:00Z,PAR-15-332,nofo_PAR-15-332,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,STANFORD,CA,UNITED STATES,itcr
U01CA242919,Exploiting POU2F3 addiction in the tuft cell variant of small cell lung cancer,"Project Summary Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is the most aggressive form of lung cancer, which is associated with a high mitotic rate, early metastatic spread, and a rapid evolution of chemotherapy resistance. We recently discovered a novel form of SCLC that resembles the tuft cell lineage, which can be distinguished from the classical neuroendocrine form of this disease through immunohistochemical staining of POU2F3. Importantly, we have identified several molecular vulnerabilities that are specific to the variant form of this disease. In this research proposal, we seek to advance personalized therapies that exploit the unique lineage program present in the tuft cell variant of SCLC. Our innovative functional genomics strategy has already uncovered actionable dependencies that are unique to tuft cell variant of SCLC, such as the kinase IGF1R. In addition, we discovered a profound addiction of tuft cell variant SCLC tumors to POU2F3. Here we will investigate the molecular basis of POU2F3 addiction in SCLC, with the explicit intent to develop small molecules that interfere with POU2F3 function. The first Aim of this proposal will build upon the extensive epigenomic analyses we have performed in SCLC, which has defined a unique enhancer landscape sustained by POU2F3 in this disease. We will now employ two independent functional approaches to elucidate the critical POU2F3 binding sites/enhancers in the genome of SCLC cells, which will be leveraged to pinpoint the critical components of the tuft cell lineage circuit that might be targeted therapeutically. The second Aim will evaluate POU2F3 cofactors, which we have already nominated via an innovative ChIP-SICAP-mass spectrometry analysis of endogenous POU2F3 binding sites. We will perform CRISPR exon scanning and biochemical analysis of each cofactor to define the critical POU2F3:cofactor interactions that selectively support this malignancy. The final Aim of this proposal will employ functional genomics to devise drug combinations with the IGF1R inhibitor linsitinib that are rational and exploit synthetic- lethal genetic interactions. We will also employ our latest CRISPR innovation, homolog co-targeting CRISPR screens, to expose redundant kinase vulnerabilities that are linked with neuroendocrine versus tuft cell variants of SCLC. In summary, we estimate that the tuft cell-like variant is present in ~18% of SCLC cases, which corresponds to approximately 5,000 newly diagnosed SCLC cases and approximately 3,500 deaths in the United States alone each year. Hence, the proposed research could lead to a sustained impact that affects a large patient population for which novel medicines are desperately needed.",2019-08-01T12:08:00Z,2024-07-31T12:07:00Z,PAR-16-049,nofo_PAR-16-049,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,COLD SPRING HARBOR,NY,UNITED STATES,sclc
U01CA242936,Computational pathology software for integrative cancer research with three-dimensional digital slides,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Tissue-based investigation remains a cornerstone of cancer research. With the advent of cost-effective digital scanners, large-scale quantitative investigations are now feasible using high throughput analysis of two- dimensional (2D) image datasets. However, 2D image analytics has its limitations, since pathologic diseases occur in three-dimensional (3D) space and 2D representations suffer from significant information loss. There are major gaps for 3D analytical digital pathology, including lack of image analysis tools to quantitatively process 3D data volumes and lack of an effective and scalable data management and analytical infrastructure to model, curate, query and mine large-scale spatial pathology features and biomarkers. We propose to fill these gaps with a new informatics solution directed at better understanding of 3D tumor micro-environments, with driving use cases on immunotherapy study for enhanced immune cell infiltration for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and pathophysiological study of rapid tumor progression in brain tumor glioblastoma (GBM). In line with Human Tumor Atlas program, we propose to create a novel and comprehensive 3D digital pathology analytics framework to quantitatively analyze spatial patterns of pathologic hallmarks and biomarkers related to disease progression in an authentic 3D tissue environment with quantitative digital pathology image volume processing, spatially integrative histology-molecular image analysis, large-scale spatial data analytics, and key cellular compartment tracking for clinical treatment response test and immunotherapy development. To enable a wide use of informatics tools for 3D digital pathology imaging data in cancer research, we will further upgrade a comprehensive, web-based system for multi-modality microscopy image management, dissemination, and visualization. We will leverage a large set of informatics tools and algorithms we have developed for microscopy image analysis, integrative translational cancer research, pathology spatial analytics, and high performance computing in the past 14 years. The developed tools will be tested and used by a suite of well-funded cancer research projects on pancreatic cancer, brain tumor, head and neck, liver, and lung cancers. The proposed informatics tools will enable precise and comprehensive characterizations of the histologic, molecular, cellular and tissue-level interactions at critical transition stages in cancer progression. They will also allow for a precise interrogation of physical and spatial signatures of immune cell infiltration into tumors, and the interactions between the host immune system and tumor cell metastasis within a complex tumor micro-environment architecture, essential for immunotherapy development. The completion of the proposed study will boost our informatics technology capabilities for large scale microscopy image analytics, help cancer researchers accurately understand cancer biology and progression mechanisms, and enable clinicians an easy access to clinically relevant information from large scale microscopy images for computer based diagnosis and therapeutic development.",2019-08-01T12:08:00Z,2023-07-31T12:07:00Z,PAR-15-332,nofo_PAR-15-332,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,ATLANTA,GA,UNITED STATES,itcr
U01CA242954,"Eliminating variants of uncertain significance in BRCA1, BRCA2 and beyond","Abstract By current evidence, roughly one-third of all cancers are driven in part by germline variation. Genetic testing now enables individuals and their doctors to better understand and manage their genetic cancer risk. However, the effectiveness of these tests is limited by the many gaps in our knowledge about the clinical impact of individual variants. Even in the well-studiedBRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, 7280 of the 17156 variants currently in ClinVar are listed as “Variants of Uncertain Significance” (VUS). VUS test reports leave patients with anxiety, and often lead to clinical mismanagement: many doctors frequently recommend bilateral mastectomies for patients with uncertain variants, even though many of those variants will turn out to be benign. Genetic testing will not reach its potential while VUS test reports are still frequent, yet with global data sharing, novel functional screens, and integrative data analysis methods, we can envisage eliminating the VUS problem. We will produce methods for secure data sharing, and integrative analysis that leverages highly predictive modern functional assays. We will demonstrate these approaches on BRCA1 and BRCA2, while outlining their application to other high-penetrance cancer susceptibility genes. We will develop APIs to integrate this new knowledge into the ClinGen and CIViC repositories, to benefit the larger research community. Finally, we will extend the integrative data visualization of BRCA Exchange to additional genes implicated in breast, ovarian and colorectal cancers, which will ultimately benefit tens of thousands of cancer patients and previvors.",2019-09-01T12:09:00Z,2023-08-31T12:08:00Z,PAR-15-332,nofo_PAR-15-332,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA CRUZ,SANTA CRUZ,CA,UNITED STATES,itcr
U01CA243004,Multiscale analysis of metabolic inflammation as a driver of breast cancer,"Women with breast cancer and co-morbid Type 2 diabetes (T2D) have up to 40% worse overall survival compared to non-diabetic women; this co-morbidity burden is disproportionately high among vulnerable cohorts, such as patients at safety net hospitals in the U.S., where it can affect half of the patient population. Yet, current models of breast tumor progression and immunotherapy are based on data from metabolically healthy cancer patients, ignoring metabolic /inflammatory components of T2D. Preliminary and published data support an overall hypothesis: specific metabolic and immune exhaustion networks in breast cancer patients with co-morbid T2D promote tumor aggressiveness. We propose an innovative multiscale modelling framework to identify these networks by integrating metabolic, inflammatory and immune signatures in multi-omics cancer models encompassing RNA-seq and phosphoproteomics data. We take a systems biology approach to combine innovative computational, clinical and patient-derived tumor organoid experiments to investigate interactions among putative driver genes, T2D and immune exhaustion, with tumor progression/aggressiveness as the primary outcome variable in estrogen receptor-negative (ER-) breast cancer, which has poor prognosis and is highly prevalent among safety net hospital patients. We will model how T2D rewires signaling hubs, nodes and edges in newly diagnosed breast cancer patients, then test these networks in breast organoid models. We will develop a unified model through three Aims: Aim 1: Determine how T2D reprograms immune exhaustion and metabolism in the tumor microenvironment of ER negative (ER-) breast cancer. We will apply RNAseq and scRNAseq to primary ER- breast cancer cells and tumor immune infiltrates to compare three groups of patients (T2D, T2D+ metformin-medicated (T2D+M), non-diabetic (ND) controls) to construct a preliminary network supplemented with TCGA data. Differential gene and pathway analyses will elucidate regulatory relationships and key hubs. We hypothesize that the connectivity of the ER- cluster in T2D will be altered and denser than in ND or T2D+M. Aim 2: We will generate patient-derived organoids, including organoid-primed T cells (OpT), to test the computational model for metabolism and immune checkpoints. We will evaluate mechanistic hypotheses that T2D medications, immune checkpoint-blocking antibodies and chemical inhibitors of BET bromodomain proteins (which regulate checkpoint expression) overcome immune exhaustion to improve OpT cell metabolism and tumor cell killing. TCR sequencing will reveal emergent OpT oligoclonality; deep immunophenotyping will reveal T2D-driven signaling networks. Aim 3: Determine abnormal signaling networks impacting cancer immunity in organoid and OpT models. We will perform deep phosphoproteomic profiling of primary tumors, organoids, circulating T cells and OpT cells, from the three metabolic groups, then use pathway projection and network analyses to refine our integrated model. Together, our unique systems biology approach will capture the complex interactions among tumor, immune infiltrates and metabolic genes to address the cancer burden of T2D.",2020-09-09T12:09:00Z,2025-08-31T12:08:00Z,PAR-19-287,nofo_PAR-19-287,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,BOSTON,MA,UNITED STATES,csbc
U01CA243007,Optimal control models of epithelial-mesenchymal transition for the design of pancreas cancer combination therapy,"PROJECT SUMMARY Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly lethal and common cancer, with an overall five-year survival rate of 6%. Among the factors contributing to this dismal statistic is the observation that epithelial- derived PDAC cells, sometimes in direct response to therapy, can de-differentiate to a mesenchymal state in which they are more chemoresistant. This observation prompts the question: should epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) be targeted to promote therapeutic response and increase patient survival? The main barrier to exploring this idea is that we do not know how to target EMT precisely, especially in light of the complex multivariate cell signaling dynamics that drive EMT and maintain it as a feedback response to chemotherapy. We recently undertook a preliminary study to identify a group of druggable cell signaling pathways that may cooperatively drive the mesenchymal state in PDAC. However, the translational potential of our current analysis is limited in that it merely identified potential targets; it does not provide any systematic actionable understanding, nor testable predictions, of how best to schedule combinations of drugs in time to maximize therapeutic efficacy and minimize unintended toxicity. Consequently, we now seek to extend our preliminary studies to develop a systems biology platform for the systematic determination of scheduled combination therapy approaches for PDAC designed to maximally suppress EMT during treatment. In Aim 1, we will make dynamic measurements of signaling pathway activity and cell phenotypes in PDAC cells treated with drivers of EMT, antagonists of EMT, and chemotherapeutics. Our measurements will cover those pathways already identified in our preliminary work as the most likely druggable regulators of EMT, and will include the effects of hypoxia and cancer-associated fibroblasts, elements of the tumor microenvironment that may impact EMT regulation. The goal is to obtain an information-rich data set to be used subsequently for model identification and control computations. In Aim 2, we will use the dynamic data to develop the computational platform for determining optimal changes to the drivers and antagonists required to achieve maximal suppression of EMT, to be implemented as scheduled combination therapies for PDAC. This will be accomplished through: (i) identification of a dynamic model for epithelial or mesenchymal cell state determination in response to phosphoprotein perturbations (i.e., quantitative characterization, in the form of a computational model, the EMT response to changes in its drivers and antagonists) and (ii) deploying the model “in reverse” to determine, via optimal control principles, how best to combine and schedule drugs for optimal maintenance of the epithelial phenotype. In Aim 3, we will test the model-based schedules for combination therapy in a sequence of in vitro and in vivo experiments. Ultimately, these studies will provide pre-clinical validation for a new strategy to develop therapeutic regimens that target a pathological process in PDAC that limits therapeutic response. New approaches are urgently needed, as PDAC survival rates have not changed in nearly 40 years.",2019-08-01T12:08:00Z,2024-07-31T12:07:00Z,PAR-16-131,nofo_PAR-16-131,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,CHARLOTTESVILLE,VA,UNITED STATES,csbc
U01CA243072,Towards rational design of combination therapeutic targets,"Project Summary Given the prevalence of crosstalk among oncogenic pathways and disease heterogeneity, it has become increasingly apparent that combination therapies are required to achieve long-term cure and to minimize development of resistance mutations and escape pathways. The majority of existing combination therapies are developed in an ad hoc fashion, namely one agent at a time, without systematic consideration of potential complex interactions among the gene targets by leveraging disease-specific omics data. Moreover, the existing combination therapies are based on targets of existing drugs, which only represent a small portion of the human proteome. To this end, we hypothesize that systematic identification of synergistic key regulators represents a promising approach for nominating targets of combination therapy. Towards this goal, we will forward engineer a platform for identifying synergistic regulatory nodes in a cancer gene regulatory network as the targets for combination therapy. We will generate disease-specific multi-omics data to construct an integrative gene regulatory network, a pre-requisite for understanding the deregulated gene network in the cancer cells and for developing effective and lasting therapy. We will focus our study on Philadelphia-like acute lymphoblastic leukemia as a proof-of-principle. Our team proposes a novel approach to this problem by leveraging the unique strengths of the investigators in systems biology, genomics, proteomics, and translational research, as well as the large cohort of patient samples available at our institutions. If successful, the proposed framework would be a tremendous advance and paradigm shift to understand genetic interactions among oncogenic pathways for eventual therapeutic intervention.",2020-06-01T12:06:00Z,2025-05-31T12:05:00Z,PAR-19-287,nofo_PAR-19-287,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,PHILADELPHIA,PA,UNITED STATES,csbc
U01CA243073,Single-cell characterization of tumor and microenvironment co-evolution in Peripheral T-cell Lymphomas,"Project Summary Tumor and microenvironment constitute complex ecologies involving a multitude of stromal cells, immune cells, and in some cases coexisting microbes. A paradigmatic example of complex tumor-microenvironment interactions are peripheral T-cell lymphomas, aggressive and genetically complex tumors where tumor cells often constitute a minority cell population. Peripheral T-cell lymphomas are frequently associated with the presence of Epstein-Barr virus whose role in the disease remains largely uncharacterized. We have shown that the presence of specific macrophage populations and viral transcriptional programs are associated to survival. But, how do tumor and microenvironment coevolve and inform prognosis? Our project goal is to characterize the tumor- microenvironment interactions and coevolution in peripheral T-cell lymphomas using large collections of human transcriptomic data and longitudinal single-cell sequencing data from recently developed mouse models. We will develop an approach based on random matrix theory and topological data analysis for modelling the continuous aspect of tumor microenvironment evolution. We will further deploy our lab-developed methodology for in silico pathogen detection to study the interactions between the Epstein-Barr virus and peripheral T-cell lymphoma lymphomagenesis and progression. Successful completion of our goals will provide a general, experimentally validated strategy to uncover the dynamical nature of tumor-microenvironment interactions at the single-cell resolution in tumor types with complex stromal component. Additionally, our approach will help uncover new microenvironment driven targets supporting lymphoma cell growth, with potential therapeutic implications for the treatment of this deadly disease.",2019-08-21T12:08:00Z,2024-07-31T12:07:00Z,PAR-16-131,nofo_PAR-16-131,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,NEW YORK,NY,UNITED STATES,csbc
U01CA243075,Multiscale Computational Models Guided By Emerging Cellular Dynamics Quantification For Predicting Optimum Immune Checkpoint And Targeted Therapy Schedules,"Project Summary The principal goal of this proposal is to combine multiscale mathematical modeling with novel computational model-driven quantitative experimental platforms to develop a comprehensive and predictive 3D computational framework. Bladder cancer is one of the 10 most common cancers in the United States and in its advanced stages the 5-year survival rates are below 35%. Given the poor outcomes with chemotherapy in advanced cases, immunotherapy has emerged as an exciting domain for exploration. Monoclonal antibodies targeting the PD- 1/PD-L1 “immune checkpoint” pathway have resulted in favorable outcomes in advanced bladder cancer, and 5 drugs targeting this pathway have been approved in the past two years. Unfortunately, the objective response rates of current FDA approved immunotherapy drugs remain less than 25%. An alternative treatment strategy for bladder cancer is small molecule inhibitors (SMIs) of fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR3), and early clinical studies using these molecular-targeted agents have shown promise. Recently published data supporting the co-acting combination of potent immune checkpoint inhibitors and specific FGFR3 inhibitors potentially offer an advance in targeted therapeutics for cancer. A powerful and practical way to optimize novel drug combinations for clinical cancer treatment is to use sophisticated, data-driven computational models. Our proposed agent- based model platform will both aid in the characterization of tumor-immune dynamics and also suggest the best strategies for administering therapeutic combinations of immune-checkpoint and receptor kinase inhibitors. The model will be parameterized at the molecular and cellular scales by an innovative high-throughput image quantification pipeline that allows T-cell or cancer cell behaviors and interactions to be observed, tracked, and quantified. Importantly, this model system pipeline can measure the antigen burden on tumor cells and the proportion of the two types of T-cell cytotoxicity (Fas-ligand vs. granule-based). Our experimentally-driven multiscale approach is posed to (1) significantly enhance the current understanding of the impact of differential cell-kill mechanisms on tumor-immune outcomes; (2) optimize the administration of combination therapy and maximize tumor response; and (3) to improve the ability to select the most promising drugs for the clinical trials. While based on tumors of the bladder, the platform that we are developing is easily adaptable for the study of any therapy targeted to immune checkpoint proteins and receptor kinases in any tumor type. The true significance of our work lies in its translational value: our experimental and theoretical studies will be able to test clinically relevant hypotheses regarding the prospect of receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors and immune checkpoint inhibitors to impact the mechanism of tumor cell kill by immune cells in distinct ways. Cancer is one of the leading causes of death for Americans and at present the overall effectiveness of therapeutic treatments is only approximately 50%. The development treatment optimization tools could have enormous and immediate impact on the lives of millions of people diagnosed with cancer.",2020-05-01T12:05:00Z,2025-04-30T12:04:00Z,PAR-19-287,nofo_PAR-19-287,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,ANN ARBOR,MI,UNITED STATES,csbc
U01CA244291,Optimizing myeloma-specific immunity after autologous stem cell transplantation,"Abstract Multiple myeloma is the second most common hematological malignancy and despite improved patient outcomes in the era of novel agents, it remains largely incurable. Clinical studies show that autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) remains an efficacious consolidation treatment for eligible patients and a subset of transplant recipients achieve long-term control of disease. Currently, the prolongation of plateau-phase induced by ASCT is attributed to the use of myeloablative chemotherapy and cytoreduction. However, ASCT generates inflammation and profound lymphodepletion, whilst disrupting the marrow microenvironment, all of which has the potential to induce anti-myeloma immunity. We have recently utilized novel preclinical models to provide definitive evidence that ASCT invokes myeloma-specific T cell immunity and the re-establishment of a state of immune equilibrium. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that disease progression after ASCT in these systems is a result of CD8 T cell exhaustion that is dependent on the accumulation of myeloid suppressive populations and the expression of multiple checkpoint molecules by CD8 T cells. These inhibitory pathways are highly amenable to immunotherapeutic approaches after ASCT that invoke long term survival. This proposal will utilize sophisticated protein and transcriptional based approaches to examine the relationship of T cell function in the peri-transplant period to subsequent survival and disease control in well-annotated clinical cohorts. A major focus will be the optimization of innovative immunotherapy approaches after ASCT in preclinical systems for clinical translation.",2019-09-25T12:09:00Z,2024-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-19-015,nofo_RFA-CA-19-015,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER CENTER,Seattle,WA,UNITED STATES,iotn
U01CA244314,Human CD3epsilon co-potentiation to boost immunotherapy,"Project Summary / Abstract A novel approach to exogenously manipulate the T cell antigen receptor (TCR) on T cells has been found that increases the sensitivity of these lymphocytes to identify and attack cancer cells in mice. This approach holds promise to function as an effective immunotherapy against metastatic cancers in humans using monovalent Fab fragments (Mono-Fabs) specific for the CD3 complex that is associated with the TCR. In the absence of strong antigen, anti-CD3 Mono-Fabs do not stimulate T cell immune function because they do not crosslink receptors for intracellular signaling. However, when exposed to antigen, T cells treated with anti-CD3 Mono- Fabs increase their level of response to weak antigenic stimulation in vitro, indicating that the Fabs bound to CD3 alter the TCR/CD3 complex and enhance T cell triggering, an effect we denominate ‘receptor co- potentiation’. When tested in mice in vivo, anti-CD3 Mono-Fabs display therapeutic properties against metastatic melanoma that depend on the presence of T cells able to recognize antigens associated with the tumor. Since anti-CD3 Mono-Fabs target the TCR/CD3 complex, testing combinations with alternative immunotherapies that target other receptors on T cells was. Anti-CD3 Mono-Fabs showed a synergistic effect with the alternative immunotherapies, including checkpoint inhibition or adoptive cell therapy, which resulted in significantly extended survival of the mice tested. Now, Mono-Fabs specific for human CD3 have been identified that may mediate T cell co-potentiation in vitro, as well produce anti-tumor T cell responses in two different and ccomplementary humanized-mouse models of metastatic melanoma. In the present proposal, transgenic mice expressing human CD3 will be crossed with inbred and outbred mouse strains in order to produce different degrees of genetic diversity to resemble adult humans. Additionally, so called “dirty mice” from pet stores will also be co-housed with human CD3-transgenic mice to induce levels of “foreign” and immune experience that better correspond with those observed in adult human immunotherapy patients. Mice from these various conditions will be used to determine the extent to which candidate anti-human CD3 Fabs display anti-tumor potential against metastatic melanoma (aim 1), in single and combination immunotherapies (with checkpoint inhibition and adoptive cell theapy), as well as the extent to which immunotoxicity occurs (aim 2). Results will inform the choice of optimal candidate(s) to subsequently undergo development for anti-cancer translational application. Finally, the CD3 signaling mechanism promoted by anti-human CD3e Fabs will be studied in a mechanismtic manner to better understand T cell co-potentiation (aim 3). If successful, this project will produce a novel modality of immunotherapy that may be exploited alone and/or to synergize other immunotherapies, and will provide a biochemical mechanistic basis for this function. The hope is that soon thereafter, experimentation might advance these studies to translational application with an ultimate goal of helping prolong survival of patients suffering from metastatic melanoma and additional malignancies.",2019-09-20T12:09:00Z,2024-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-19-015,nofo_RFA-CA-19-015,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,COLUMBIA,MO,UNITED STATES,iotn
U01CA244452,Mechanisms of Exosome Driven Immunoregulation of Cancer Progression,"PROJECT ABSTRACT: Antibodies against the immune checkpoint proteins PD-L1 and PD-1 have revolutionized cancer therapeutics resulting in durable remissions in many patients previous considered incurable. However, a majority of patients remain resistant and cancer types can vary greatly in their response rates. Thus, there is an urgent need to understand the variation in response in order to improve cancer care. This proposal brings together a team of investigators with complementary expertise in basic, translational, and clinical science who share the long-term goal of finding novel approaches to categorize and personalize cancer treatments. Recent results from the investigators suggest a major role for the packaging of immune checkpoint proteins in exosomes underlying the variation in responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors among patients. Specifically, varying amounts of PD-L1 can be trafficked to exosomes, which in turn can act at a distance to suppress anti-tumor T cell function, enabling tumor progression, even in models resistant to anti-PD-L1 treatments. The objective of this proposal is to build on these findings by focusing on the mechanism of exosomal PD-L1 packaging, action, and resistance to therapeutic antibodies. In particular, the proposal will test the overall hypothesis that tumor cells can selectively package PD-L1 into exosomes that suppress T cell priming at distal sights in a fashion that is distinct from the cell-cell interactions of PD-L1 and PD-1 normally seen in the tumor bed. The hypothesis is premised on extensive preliminary data using in vitro and in vivo models showing that the relative fraction of PD-L1 packaged in exosomes versus retained in cells varies between cell lines, that suppression of exosomal PD-L1 can result in long-term systemic anti-tumor immunity, and that exosomal PD-L1 is resistant to anti-PD-L1 antibodies. To test the overall hypothesis, the following aims are proposed: 1) Uncover mechanisms underlying the selective packaging of PD-L1 into exosomes, 2) Evaluate the mechanistic basis of exosomal PD-L1’s impact on systemic immunity, 3) Dissect how exosomal PD-L1 interacts with and regulates its target cells. In aim 1, structure/function and proteomic approaches are proposed to identify the regulators of PD-L1 packaging into exosomes. Furthermore, associations between expression of these factors and resistance to therapy will be evaluated using primary patient samples. In aim 2, mouse-based immunological approaches and patient samples will be used to determine where in the immune axis exosomal PD-L1 functions. Uncovered insights will then be used to develop a novel therapeutic approach to enhance the anti-tumor immune response. In aim 3, microscopy and functional studies in in vitro models along with association studies with patient samples will be used to determine how exosomal PD-L1 interacts with its target cells potentially explaining its resistance to antibodies. The proposal is highly significant in that it is expected to provide new fundamental knowledge that can be used to identify and treat the large fraction of patients resistant to current immune therapies. While this proposal focuses on a subset of cancer models with a particular emphasis on prostate cancer, the paradigms uncovered are expected to be relevant across most if not all tumor types.",2019-09-23T12:09:00Z,2024-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-19-015,nofo_RFA-CA-19-015,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",SAN FRANCISCO,CA,UNITED STATES,iotn

It will estimate tumor purity and intra-tumor heterogeneity in both DNA and RNA data, quantify tumor-allele-specific copy number (ASCN) profiles and tumor allele-specific expression levels (ASEL), and integrate ASCN and ASEL profiles to identify functional genomic variants. 2) TransBreak will expand our well-established k- mer-based assembly approach (novoBreak, Nature Methods 2016) to detect novel transcriptomic junctions and variants in the tumor WTS data and predict neo-antigens from assembled novel RNA isoforms. The output of these tools will be thoroughly evaluated using both computational and experimental means through consortia such as TCGA and bench/clinical collaborators using established protocols and resources.

U01CA248226,RadxTools for assessing tumor treatment response on imaging,"ABSTRACT: Over 1.6 million patients in the U.S. annually undergo chemo- or radiation- as first-line cancer therapy. After therapy, the most significant challenge for oncologists is identifying non-responders (those with residual or progressive disease), which could allow them to be switched to alternative therapies. Similarly, if those with stable or regressing disease were identified early and reliably, patients could avoid unnecessary and highly morbid surgeries or biopsies for disease confirmation. Unfortunately, expert assessment of post-treatment imaging is challenging, as residual disease is visually confounded with benign treatment-induced changes on imaging. There is hence a critical need for dedicated radiomic (computerized feature extraction from imaging) and informatics approaches to enable reliable post-treatment tumor assessment. Such tools will need to account for: (1) Limited well-curated data resources with deeply annotated pathology-validated radiographic datasets, for discovery and validation of new imaging and radiomic markers for post-treatment characterization in vivo; (2) Need for specialized radiomics tools that specifically quantify morphological perturbations in response to shrinkage/growth of the lesion for identifying progressive disease (versus benign confounders), despite presence of treatment-induced artifacts (exacerbated noise, reduced contrast, poor resolution); and (3) Lack of comprehensive quality control (QC) tools to identify which of a plethora of radiomic features are both discriminable as well as generalizable to variations between sites and scanners. To address these challenges, we propose RadxTools, a new image informatics toolkit comprising three modules: (a) RadQC to enable quality control of radiomics features across multi-site imaging cohorts, (b) RadTx comprising new radiomics tools which capture local surface morphometric changes and subtle structural deformations unique to tumor response on post-treatment imaging, and (c) RadPathFuse for creating deeply annotated learning sets by spatially mapping post-treatment changes from ex vivo surgically excised histopathology specimens onto pre-operative in vivo imaging. RadxTools will be evaluated in the context of post-treatment characterization for use cases in distinguishing (a) radiation effects from cancer recurrence for brain tumors; and (b) complete/partial vs incomplete chemoradiation response for rectal cancers. Deliverables and Dissemination: Our team has had a successful history of disseminating informatics tools (>1000 downloads), including our most recent release of RadTx which has been integrated into 3 informatics platforms. By organizing community resources and targeted workshops, as well as releasing highly curated data cohorts, our team is uniquely positioned to disseminate RadxTools to the radiomics/imaging community, professional societies, and oncology working groups. Our deliverables will include tool prototypes as modules within 5 QIN/ITCR-funded platforms (3D Slicer, MeVisLab, Sedeen, CapTk, QIFP) for widespread dissemination to targeted end-user communities, in addition to deeply annotated learning sets assembled through the 2 use-cases in this project.",2020-07-01T12:07:00Z,2024-06-30T12:06:00Z,RFA-CA-19-039,nofo_RFA-CA-19-039,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,CLEVELAND,OH,UNITED STATES,itcr
U01CA248235,"Informatics tools for identification, prioritization and clinical application of neoantigens","Project Summary/Abstract Somatic mutations in cancer cells lead to the production of neoantigens: patient- and tumor-specific peptides that are capable of inducing T cell recognition. Recent clinical trials have established that, when introduced in a vaccine, these neoantigens can stimulate anti-tumor immune responses. The path to producing such a personalized vaccine begins with sequencing a patient’s tumor, identifying candidate somatic mutations and then computationally predicting which neoepitopes will be most effective at stimulating a T-cell response. This prediction step should ideally assess a complex interplay of factors, including the type of somatic mutation, the patient’s class I and II HLA alleles, peptide processing, peptide transport, peptide-MHC binding and many co- factors of immune recognition and signaling. The best current approaches focus almost entirely on a single factor (peptide-MHC binding) and have only a 16-43% success rate in predicting immunogenic peptides. To address this challenge we will develop pVACtools, an informatics toolkit for comprehensive identification, characterization, and clinical application of neoantigens. This tool will be the first to support all major neoepitope sources including insertions, deletions, transcript isoforms, gene fusions, peptides from normally non-coding regions, and B cell or T cell rearrangements (BCRs/TCRs). We will also integrate analysis of Class I and II peptide-MHC binding. All tools will be developed to support foundational pre-clinical work in animal models of immunotherapy. Furthermore, we will test several specific hypotheses relating to new predictors of immunogenicity. To elucidate these factors and enhance prioritization of neoantigens we will create the first open access database of experimentally and clinically validated neoantigens. Using these data we will address the question of what peptide-intrinsic and patient-specific features determine the therapeutic potential of a neoantigen. To validate their translational potential, we will apply our neoantigen tools to clinical trials involving checkpoint blockade drugs and personalized cancer vaccines. We will develop a visualization interface that facilitates clinical review and selection of neoantigen candidates for several vaccine delivery platforms. These tools will be used to perform analysis of >200 cases from ongoing vaccine trials to evaluate their performance and address key outstanding immunobiology questions including: (a) the importance of particular neoantigen sources in specific cancer types, (b) the importance of accurately determining HLA mutation/expression, (c) the significance of having both MHC class I and II restricted peptides in a vaccine, (d) how to identify specific neoepitope/TCR pairings, and (e) how neoantigens contribute to mechanisms of resistance to immunotherapies. These tools will thus enable fundamental studies of T cell biology, lead to more effective personalized cancer vaccine designs, and support better prediction of response to checkpoint blockade therapy. Finally, based on these experiences and in collaboration with our team of clinical vaccine trial leaders, we will develop detailed guidelines and training materials for neoantigen analysis.",2020-08-01T12:08:00Z,2024-07-31T12:07:00Z,RFA-CA-19-039,nofo_RFA-CA-19-039,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,SAINT LOUIS,MO,UNITED STATES,itcr
U01CA248240,An informatics bridge over the valley of death for cancer Phase I trials of drug-combination therapies,"An informatics bridge over the valley of death for Phase I trials of drug-combination cancer therapies Summary Phase I studies usually focus on drug toxicity and pharmacokinetics, and most (58%) drugs intended as cancer therapies fail these initial trials. Thus, Phase I studies represent the largest valley of death in the course of drug development. Unlike the design of a single-drug Phase I study, the design of a drug-combination study requires prior knowledge of whether either drug changes the other’s drug exposure, the drugs share toxicities, and each drug has an established maximum tolerable dose. Although abundant toxicity and PK data are available in public domain sources, the data are not integrated, and no single database integrates data regarding both toxicity and PK. In addition, data regarding single-drug and drug-combination MTD and DLT are present in the literature but absent from any database. We are confident that a bridge can be built across the Phase I valley of death for cancer multi-drug research and development utilizing an informatics and pharmacometrics approach to take advantage of the abundant toxicity and PK data available for single drugs. In this grant, we propose a translational drug-interaction knowledgebase (TDCKB) that integrates toxicity and PK data. Aim 1 will develop novel active-learning approaches to mine evidence of toxicity and PK regarding drug interactions from the literature. The active learning methodology will employ several innovations, including random negative sampling, stratified active learning by prescreening based on PubMed query, and deep learning with embedding. The final active-learning method is optimized by a thorough integration of these innovative components. Aim 2 will develop a translational drug-interaction knowledgebase (TDCKB) for cancer research. The TDCKB will integrate toxicity and PK evidence for single drugs and drug combinations from various data sources. The evidence of DDI will be classified as either toxicity or PK, and the strength of the evidence will be annotated. Synthesized evidences, such as overlapping toxicity and predicted drug interactions between two drugs, will assist in Phase I drug combination trial design. Quality control will be conducted carefully during both data curation and TDCKB software development. Engagement of TDCKB users and the ITCR community is planned.",2021-09-24T12:09:00Z,2024-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-20-008,nofo_RFA-CA-20-008,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,COLUMBUS,OH,UNITED STATES,itcr
U01CA249245,Informatics Tools To Analyze And Model Whole Slide Image Data At The Single Cell Level,"Project Summary Digital scanning of tissue slides, including both hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained and immunohistochemistry (IHC)-stained slides, is becoming a routine clinical procedure. Technological advances in imaging, computing and molecular profiling have enabled in-depth tissue characterization at single-cell resolution while retaining the cell spatial information and its histological context. The confluence of these developments has created unprecedented opportunities for studying the relationships among tumor morphology, molecular events, and clinical outcomes. However, there is a lack of computational tools that can fully utilize the comprehensive information in tissue images at the single-cell level. The overarching goal of this proposal is to develop iSEE-Cell (image-based Spatial pattern ExplorEr for Cells), a suite of informatics tools to enable image data analysis, spatial modeling and data integration at single-cell resolution. In order to achieve this goal, we have built a strong research team with complementary expertise in image analysis, machine learning, spatial modelling, single cell genomics, cancer pathology and software development. Specifically, we will: 1. Develop algorithms to classify different types of cells based on nucleus morphology, that will be applicable to all types of tissue images. 2. Develop a powerful image restoration tool and quality enhancer for restoring blurred regions, enhancing low resolution/magniﬁcation into high resolution, and normalizing staining colors. 3. Develop and integrate tissue image analysis, spatial modeling and visualization tools into the iSEE-Cell platform. We will engage users, including informaticians, oncologists, pathologists, surgeons and cancer biologists, in the process of algorithm and tool development to collect feedback for the proposed informatics tools. All proposed methods were motivated by real-world biological and clinical applications.

U01CA253383,Understanding the molecular mechanism of a protein-recycling complex in small cell lung cancer treatment resistance.,"PROJECT SUMMARY Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) patients have an initial robust response to combinations of DNA damaging agents (e.g. cisplatin, etoposide, radiotherapy), however, many patients inevitably suffer from relapse and resistant disease. A clear understanding of these resistance mechanisms remains elusive. Consequently, there is a critical need to: (1) understand the mechanisms of therapeutic resistance and (2) develop novel therapeutics. Poly-(ADP)-ribose polymerase enzymes (PARP) protein levels are upregulated in SCLC relative to other lung cancers, and initial studies suggest that this upregulation is associated with increased sensitivity of SCLC to PARP inhibitors (PARPi) in vitro. PARP inhibitors are synthetic lethal with BRCA1/2 mutated homologous recombination (HR) deficient tumors and restoration of HR by BRCA reversion mutations is a known mechanism of PARPi and cisplatin resistance. However, as BRCA1/2 mutations are exceedingly rare in SCLC non-BRCA mechanisms must be operant. We performed a genome-wide CRISPR knockout screen to identify novel mechanisms of PARPi resistance. From subsequent functional validation and clinical genomic correlation, we identified deficiency in an F-box protein coding gene as a putative biomarker of resistance to PARP inhibitors and cisplatin in SCLC that may be present in up to ~20% of relapse patient tumors. Loss of this F-box protein abrogates the function of its corresponding SKP1, CUL1, F-box (SCF) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. By proximity-dependent biotin identification (BioID) of this F-box protein, we have identified a high confidence interactor with substrate-like behavior for SCF-mediated ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation that is important for regulation of HR and DNA repair. This proposal aims to: (1) determine the mechanism of this specific SCF complex with its substrate to engage the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway; (2) elucidate the impact of this F-box protein on HR, DNA repair, and therapeutic sensitivity to PARPi/cisplatin; and (3) identify synthetic lethal interactions with deficiencies in this F-box protein to provide biologic insight and characterize immediately translatable approaches for relapsed treatment resistant SCLC.",2020-09-25T12:09:00Z,2026-08-31T12:08:00Z,PAR-19-361,nofo_PAR-19-361,UNIVERSITY HEALTH NETWORK,TORONTO,ON,CANADA,sclc
U01CA253403,Single-cell and imaging data integration software to spatially resolve the tumor microenvironment,"Project Summary The tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a critical role in cancer progression and therapeutic response. New single cell and imaging technologies provide unprecedented measurements of cell type composition, subtypes of common cell types in disparate states, interactions between neighboring cells, and T cell function. However, each of these components of the TME are captured by disparate measurement technologies. Both new computational methods and software for multi-platform data integration are essential to characterize the TME. Therefore, we propose a unified R/Bioconductor package TMEMap for multi-platform single cell data integration. Aim 1 will integrate single cell RNA-sequencing and single cell TCR-sequencing data to distinguish T cell function in distinct T cell subtypes and states. Aim 2 will integrate combined single cell RNA-sequencing and protein from CITE-seq with imaging proteomics for digital pathology to map cellular interactions in the TME. Aim 3 will further the disseminate this software with through GenePattern Notebook. This workflow will be developed in collaboration with clinical investigators to ensure usability and interpretability of the visualization methods using clinical biospecimens from synergistic studies. Altogether, this software will provide a strong foundation for future work embedding these methods in a database for multi-platform single cell data to automatically perform comprehensive TME characterization in large scale NCI profiling efforts such as the Human Tumor Atlas Network.",2020-09-01T12:09:00Z,2024-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-19-039,nofo_RFA-CA-19-039,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,BALTIMORE,MD,UNITED STATES,itcr
U01CA253405,"Advanced development of Lancet, an emerging tool for complex variant calling in cancer genomics","ABSTRACT One of the central challenges in cancer genomics is the ability to accurately detect somatic mutations in heterogeneous tumors, and precisely determine their clonal origin and evolution. This fundamental knowledge is central to the discovery of new cancer therapies. In recent years, reductions in the cost of whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing have enabled researchers to address these questions in unprecedented detail. However, a major limitation in the field has been a paucity of methods for variant calling that extend beyond identifying simple single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and small indels to allow the characterization of complex structural changes that also play a significant role in tumorigenesis and cancer progression. Indels of more than a few bases are challenging to discover with typically used alignment-based methods. In addition, most variant callers analyze tumor and normal data separately, which can introduce false positives such as when a mutation shows partial support in the normal sample. Towards addressing these shortcomings, we recently introduced Lancet, a new somatic variant caller developed under the auspices of the ITCR R21. Lancet leverages local assembly and joint analysis of tumor-normal paired data using region-focused colored de Bruijn graphs, with on- the-fly repeat composition analysis and a self-tuning k-mer strategy. This results in relatively reduced reference bias; an improved ability to detect variations that significantly diverge from the reference chromosome representations; a reduction in the scale of the analysis, leading to increased power and sensitivity to detect variants through localized, comprehensive graph exploration; and dynamic adjustment of calling behavior according to the sequence conditions of each genomic region. In testing, Lancet shows superior performance to all major alignment-based methods in terms of accuracy, particularly in the detection of ‘twilight zone’ indels (30- 250 bp). Given its continued adoption and successful application in over a dozen high-impact publications, Lancet is poised for more advanced development to enable continued improvements in its variant calling power, precision, and analytical capabilities. Specifically, Lancet is currently limited by longer runtimes than alignment- based methods, reduced sensitivity for longer insertions, lack of interactive visualization of the colored de Bruijn graph, and the inability to jointly analyze longitudinal data. To address these limitations, we propose the following Specific Aims: 1) Increase computational performance and facilitate user adoption and third-party development; 2) Add new features and enhancements to improve variant detection, phasing, and data visualization; and 3) Enable joint assembly and analysis of longitudinal data. Impact: With additional development, the next iteration of Lancet will feature advanced algorithms for fast, efficient, accurate, localized, user-friendly, and application- modifiable variant analysis of phased genome-wide timeseries data, establishing it as one of the leading methods for variant calling in cancer research.",2021-09-20T12:09:00Z,2024-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-20-008,nofo_RFA-CA-20-008,NEW YORK GENOME CENTER,NEW YORK,NY,UNITED STATES,itcr
U01CA253472,Mechanistic maps of adaptive responses to therapeutic stress to optimize combination therapies.,"Summary. In triple-negative breast cancer and high-grade serous ovarian cancer, the emergence of resistance to therapy is virtually inevitable and contributes to dismal long-term patient outcomes. The team will test the hypothesis that tumor ecosystems rapidly adapt to stress engendered by therapies, leading to the rapid emergence of resistance. As a corollary, blocking adaptive responses in tumor cells and the immune microenvironment will interdict the emergence of resistance. The objective is to monitor mechanisms underlying adaptive responses across temporal and spatial scales with single-cell precision, predict responses to untested combinatorial perturbations, and validate predicted drug combinations, fueling future clinical trials. An interactive team with diverse and complementary expertise and long collaboration history has been assembled: cancer and systems biology and therapeutics (Mills, contact PI, OHSU), computational biology/image analysis (Korkut, PI, MDACC; Goecks, OHSU), bioinformatics and systems biology (Liang, PI, MDACC), single-cell transcriptomics and proteomics (Mohammed, OHSU), molecular and anatomic pathology (Corless, OHSU; Sahin, MDACC), and ovarian and breast cancer translational research (Westin, MDACC; Mitri, OHSU). We will pursue two specific aims. Aim 1. Develop novel algorithms to create mechanistic maps of adaptive responses to therapeutic stress. The team will innovate algorithms to build data-driven and predictive models encompassing tumor cell signaling, microenvironment, and immune modulation. An extensive pre-existing longitudinal proteomics dataset of cell lines, xenografts, novel murine transplantable syngeneic models, PDXs, and patient samples will serve as the experimental data and constraints driving model construction. The modeling approaches will identify cellular vulnerabilities arising from adaptive responses to therapeutic stress and predict responses to untested combinatorial perturbations. The team will also determine whether therapeutic targeting “steers” proteomically heterogeneous tumors to a more therapeutically tractable homogenous state. For this purpose, we will use state- of-the-art multiplexed imaging-based proteomics technologies to formulate and implement data-driven models at spatial and single-cell precision. The single-cell, data-driven modeling will demonstrate how targeted therapies alter the tumor and immune microenvironment, leading to therapeutic vulnerabilities that new targeted therapy or immunotherapy combinations could exploit. Aim 2. Validate rational drug combinations targeting adaptive responses to therapy in relevant settings. The team will use cell lines, xenografts, PDXs, and novel murine transplantable syngeneic models to validate the therapeutic tractability of the rational drug combinations predicted by the data-driven models under Aim 1. Importantly, the experimental assessment will inform and improve the computational models through iterative data acquisition and subsequent remodeling. Novel therapy combinations will be assessed through clinical trials supported by other funds. The emerging principles and tools are highly applicable to other cancer lineages and could provide broad benefits.",2021-04-01T12:04:00Z,2026-03-31T12:03:00Z,PAR-19-287,nofo_PAR-19-287,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,PORTLAND,OR,UNITED STATES,csbc
U01CA253481,Integrative genomic and epigenomic analysis of cancer using long read sequencing,"PROJECT SUMMARY The last twenty years have experienced extensive growth in the sequencing of cancer genomes, leading to a dramatically increased understanding of the role of genetic and epigenetic mutations in cancer. This has largely been enabled by developments in high-throughput “second-generation” sequencing technology and analysis that characterize cancer genomes using short-reads. Recently, a new generation of high-throughput long-read sequencing instruments, primarily from Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore, have become available that are poised to displace short-read sequencing for many applications. We and others have used these technologies to discover tens of thousands of variants per cancer genome that are not detectable using short-reads, including structural variants and differentially methylated regions in known oncogenes and cancer risk genes. These technologies carry the potential to address many open questions in cancer biology, however, the analysis of long-read sequencing data is computationally demanding and needs specialized algorithms that are either too inefficient to use at scale or do not yet exist. In this proposal, we will address several gaps in the application of long-read technology for basic research and clinical use in cancer genomics. First, we will develop improved methods for finding structural variants and complex repeat expansions from long-reads, both of which are major diagnostic and prognostic indicators of disease, yet are not accurately identified using existing methods. Leveraging the improved phasing capabilities of long reads, this work will include the detection of mosaic variants, revealing tumor heterogeneity and variants in precancerous tissues. Next, we will apply machine learning and systems level advances to accelerate and improve the comparison of variants across large patient cohorts. Critically, this will compensate for the error prone nature of single molecule long-read sequencing to make these comparisons more accurate when comparing tumor-normal samples or pedigrees of related patients so that recurrent driving mutations can be accurately identified. Finally, we will develop integrative methods for the joint analysis of genome, transcriptome, and epigenetic profiling of cancer genomes. These advances will improve the identification of fusion genes, and allow for entirely new forms of epigenetic analysis, such as the allele-specific analysis of methylation across transposable elements and other repetitive elements. Synthesizing the many thousands of novel variants we will detect using our methods, we will then develop algorithms that will identify and evaluate recurrent genetic or epigenetic variations as putative driving mutations. All methods will be released open-source and will empower us, our ITCR collaborators, and the cancer genomics community at large to study genetic and epigenetic variants with near perfect accuracy and thereby unlock many new associations to treatment and disease.",2021-05-01T12:05:00Z,2024-04-30T12:04:00Z,RFA-CA-20-008,nofo_RFA-CA-20-008,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,BALTIMORE,MD,UNITED STATES,itcr
U01CA253500,Utilizing Bayesian modeling to improve mutational signature inference in large-scale datasets,"The goals of this proposal are to develop novel statistical methods, more accurate inference procedures, and interactive software tools to perform mutational signature deconvolution in cancer samples. Mutational signatures are patterns of co-occurring mutations that can reveal insights into a cancer's etiology and evolution. Currently, non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is the “gold-standard” for mutational signature deconvolution. However, NMF has several deficiencies in that it cannot do the following things: 1) predict signatures in new samples, 2) perform joint learning of known and novel signatures at the same time, 3) alleviate problems from signature “bleeding”, 4) cluster tumors into subgroups based on mutational signature profiles, and 5) characterize uncertainty in model fit. In this proposal, we will develop a novel Bayesian hierarchical models that overcome the limitations of NMF. Furthermore, there is a lack of interactive software for mutational signature inference and visualization for non-computational users. We will also develop an R/Shiny interface on top of our R package to facilitate data preprocessing, inference, and visualization of large-scale datasets. This interface will have a cloud backend to facilitate computationally intensive operations. Overall, this software will streamline mutational signature analysis for noncomputational researchers and will have the capability to interface with other projects from the Informatics Technology for Cancer Research (ITCR) program. Finally, we will analyze a novel targeted sequencing dataset from Chinese patients and perform a meta-analysis of all publicly available variants to generate a novel reference set of mutational signatures for investigators to use in their own studies. Overall, our tools will be of great interest to the cancer community as it will provide greater insights into mutational signature patterns and will be useful in clinical settings to reveal insights into cancer etiology.",2021-09-17T12:09:00Z,2024-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-20-008,nofo_RFA-CA-20-008,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,BOSTON,MA,UNITED STATES,itcr
U01CA253511,Technology for efficient simulation of cancer cell transport,"Cancer is the attributed cause of death in one in four cases in the United States and metastasis, a complex multistep process leading to the spread of tumors, is responsible for more than 90% of these deaths. However, predicting the location of these secondary tumor sites is still an elusive goal. One of the fundamental hurdles is to understand the trajectory of cell movement through the vascular system and the likelihood of penetration of the vessel wall. Studies have demonstrated that more than 50% of cancer metastatic sites could be explained by the blood flow pattern between the primary and secondary; however, the development of predictive models is still needed. Insight into the underlying mechanisms of cancer metastasis will provide insight into disease progression and lead to the development of new diagnostic or therapeutic methods targeting regions of the vasculature likely to incur secondary tumor sites. Tools that can be easily tuned to allow not only patient-specific but cell-specific modeling would complement ongoing in vitro experiments and provide this critical insight. Such computational models would allow researchers to probe the influence of different biophysical properties on cancer-specific cell behavior without the need for either expensive experimental trials for each cell-type or extrapolate from findings for one cancer to apply to another. An expected outcome of this research to create a usable, scalable, and extensible software framework for use by the wider biomedical research community to study the role of biophysical properties on a cell's transport and potential arrest. On such a platform, users will be able to introduce models of their cells-of-interest and perform simulations on them with models we (or others in the community) have developed. The ability to seamlessly introduce new cell-types with minimal effort will foster entirely new collaborations between researchers and provide biologists who would not traditionally leverage computational resources to study cell-specific properties in the context of realistic vascular geometries. This work will set the stage for future studies expanding the capabilities of this open source model.",2020-08-15T12:08:00Z,2023-07-31T12:07:00Z,RFA-CA-19-039,nofo_RFA-CA-19-039,DUKE UNIVERSITY,DURHAM,NC,UNITED STATES,itcr
U01CA253540,Systems Approaches to Understanding Subpopulation Heterogeneity in Therapeutic Resistance,"PROJECT SUMMARY In recent years, improvements in diagnosis and treatment have extended the lives of many patients with triple negative breast cancer, but resistance to treatment remains a major clinical and scientific challenge. While standard-of-care treatment and chemotherapy is effective in many TNBC patients, approximately 40% of patients display resistance, leading to poor overall survival. TNBC are characterized by significant intratumor heterogeneity, which further complicates treatment. Mechanisms of chemoresistance in TNBC patients remain poorly understood, in part due to a lack of available methods and models to measure intratumor heterogeneity and track changes in heterogeneous tumor compositions over time. Here we propose to use a new technology to track individual cells and clones as they respond to different chemotherapeutic agents; this more detailed information about the tumor cell population will be used to build mathematical models better predict and optimize therapeutic response. We first measure individual cell gene expression changes in response to treatment and then assemble these measurements into cell subpopulation trajectories, taking advantage of a barcoding technology developed in our lab to quantify clonally-resolved single cell transcriptomes. These Aim 1 studies will build a compendium of gene expression, cell growth and survival data that describes how each of the heterogeneous cells in major experimental models of subtypes of triple negative breast cancer responds to clinically-relevant therapeutic agents. The new ability to layer clonal identifier information on single cell gene expression data reveals the detailed trajectories of individual cells that escape therapy. It also distinguishes subpopulations with pre-existing treatment resistance from those in which a resistant state is induced. At a higher conceptual level, this proposal seeks to also address a broad practical challenge: the high-dimensional ‘omics’ data collected in many large-scale efforts points often points to correlations in disease progression but not been informative for building mechanistic models to aid in the predictive of tumor response. Often, other types of data are more readily available-- lower dimensional data with more frequent measurements. We therefore next ask: How can these distinct data types be integrated into a useful framework to build predictive models of tumor cell response to therapy? This seems a fitting goal for the systems biology of cancer community. We propose to tackle this challenge with our barcode tracking technology; relative fractions of sensitive and resistance phenotypes, along with separate longitudinal measurements of cell number (low dimension data), become the inputs for a mechanistic model to predict therapeutic response and resistance (Aim 2). In Aim 3, we will perform trajectory-mapping and model testing using patient-derived triple negative breast cancer cells, towards understanding the potential for translational utility. By integrating different data types into a cohesive framework, we aim to describe how sensitive and resistant subpopulations in TNBC grow, die, and transition in response to treatment.",2020-09-08T12:09:00Z,2025-08-31T12:08:00Z,PAR-19-287,nofo_PAR-19-287,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN,AUSTIN,TX,UNITED STATES,csbc
U01CA253547,Identifying therapeutic pathways targeting medulloblastoma-immune cell interactions,"SUMMARY We propose developing a systems-biology approach to understand interactions between tumor and immune cells and their clinical implications. Our work will focus on medulloblastoma, a malignant pediatric brain tumor in which our team has extensive expertise. We and others have shown that medulloblastoma tumors are sites of immune activity despite the blood-brain barrier. However, the clinical consequences of these immune cells are unclear and there is little information that might guide development of therapeutics that modulate these immune cells. Our innovative strategy combines single-cell methods, including single-cell proteomics, with a sophisticated computational analysis. In Aim 1, we map the landscape of tumor-immune interactions using sequencing and imaging methods on human samples. Aim 2 builds a causal model of the molecular interactions that govern interactions among cell types in medulloblastoma, determines the clinical correlates of these cells, and identifies potential therapeutic targets. Aim 3 maps the tumor-immune environment in well-validated mouse models of the disease, and builds computational models for mice parallel to those for humans. Hypotheses from Aim 2 that are likely to translate well to the mouse models are then tested for their effects on tumor growth and survival. The mouse results are used to update the computational models and refine the therapeutic strategies. We expect that successful completion of this project will have a substantial impact on medulloblastoma therapeutics. Further, the methods we develop will catalyze research of interactions between immune cells and many other tumor types beyond medulloblastoma.",2021-05-01T12:05:00Z,2026-04-30T12:04:00Z,PAR-19-287,nofo_PAR-19-287,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,CAMBRIDGE,MA,UNITED STATES,csbc
U01CA253553,Spatiotemporal modeling of cancer-niche interactions in breast cancer bone metastasis,"ABSTRACT About 20-40% of breast cancer patients develop metastasis to the bone, years to even decades after surgical removal of primary tumors. Little is known about the biology of the latent, microscopic bone metastases before they outgrow to overt osteolytic macrometastases. This represents a significant gap in our understanding of bone metastasis. Targeting cancer cells that have not fully adapted to the bone microenvironment might provide therapeutic benefit and prevent the occurrence of overt metastases. Bone and bone marrow comprise of several highly distinctive microenvironment niches. Dormant, single disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) reside in the perivascular niche, whereas proliferative, multi-cell bone micrometastases (BMMs) are found in the osteogenic niche that exhibits features of active osteogenesis. Mechanisms through which the transition of different niches occurs to switch fates of metastatic seeds remain elusive. The overall objectives of this project are to investigate the spatiotemporal dynamics, the molecular crosstalk, and the therapeutic targets underlying the interaction between breast cancer cells and different microenvironment niches in bone. We will pursue three specific aims. First, we will dissect the spatiotemporal dynamics of the perivascular and osteogenic niches and the cancer-niche interactions in bone micrometastasis models. We will use high-resolution, whole- bone, multi-photon microscopy and laser-captured microdissection (LCM) followed by transcriptome profiling (LCM-seq) to obtain relative localization and mutual impacts between cancer cells and niche cells in situ. Second, we will integrate transcriptomic and imaging data and develop computational models for discovery of new mechanisms and therapies toward blockade of cancer-niche interactions. Established and new algorithms will be used to uncover the microenvironment molecules, and autocrine and paracrine signaling pathways mediating niche-tumor interactions. Drug-repurposing analyses will be carried out to identify potential therapies that have already been used for other diseases. We will achieve a systematic understanding of early-stage bone colonization and generate testable mechanistic and therapeutic hypotheses. Third, we will validate the discovered mechanisms and predicted drug efficacies in animal models. The Zhang laboratory has adopted and established a series of genetically engineered mouse models and bone metastasis assays, which will be utilized to validate computational predictions generated by computational modeling by the Wong group. Both metastatic burden and frequency/distribution of DTCs and BMMs will be examined as endpoints. This study will unbiasedly profile the molecular process of early stage metastasis progression in the bone from DTCs to BMMs at single-to-few cell resolutions. This knowledge is unprecedented and critical for the ultimate understanding of metastasis latency, a long-standing clinical challenge. The modeling tool developed through this study will likely be applicable to other biological contexts involving highly spatiotemporally specific cancer- niche interaction. The computer-aided drug repurposing will likely lead to fast clinical translation.",2020-09-15T12:09:00Z,2025-08-31T12:08:00Z,PAR-19-287,nofo_PAR-19-287,METHODIST HOSPITAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE,HOUSTON,TX,UNITED STATES,csbc
U01CA256780,Molecular and immunological heterogeneity of Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC) and its impact on relapse and therapeutic response,"PROJECT SUMMARY Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive malignancy for which there is a critical need for improved therapeutic strategies. While targeted and immune-based therapies have demonstrated encouraging results recently, they have shown benefit in only a subset of patients and, thus, have yielded little to no impact on the survival of unselected populations and even these benefits are limited by the rapid onset of resistance. There are currently no standard markers for selecting treatment or evaluating therapeutic resistance, issues made more challenging by the dearth of available tissue for molecular assessment in SCLC. Recent evidence from our group and others suggests that SCLC is a molecularly diverse disease and can be divided into four subtypes largely defined by the differential expression of three transcription factors [ASCL1 (SCLC-A), NEUROD1 (SCLC-N), and POU2F3 (SCLC-P)], and a fourth subtype with high expression of inflammatory and mesenchymal markers [Inflamed, (SCLC-I)]. Each subtype is characterized, in vitro, by distinct therapeutic vulnerabilities. Moreover, we showed that genomic and immune intra-tumoral heterogeneity (ITH) portends poorer survival, while increasing transcriptional ITH may be associated with therapeutic resistance in SCLC. The overarching goal of this proposal is to systematically investigate heterogeneity in SCLC and its association with therapeutic response, and develop tools to evaluate these features in the clinic. More specifically, we hypothesize (1) That SCLC is heterogeneous and can be divided into major subgroups with distinct therapeutic vulnerabilities; and (2) That greater ITH- assessed either at the genomic, immune, or transcriptional level- is associated with therapeutic resistance in SCLC and can be assessed dynamically during treatment in a non-invasive manner using blood-based biomarkers. To address these hypotheses, in Aim 1, we will assess whether these four molecular subtypes can serve as predictive biomarkers in co-clinical trials in vivo and in retrospective patient tissue analyses, while also developing blood-based strategies to identify the subtypes. In Aim 2, we will assess ITH at multiple molecular levels, including genomic, transcriptomic, methylomic, and immunologic, to characterize how baseline ITH influences patient survival. Lastly, in Aim 3, we will assess dynamic changes in transcriptional ITH following treatment, using paired samples from in vivo models and patient samples, to determine if increasing ITH of molecular subtype drives resistance and whether epigenetic modification may prevent or reverse it. The overall hypothesis tested here is that careful initial molecular subtyping of SCLC tumors, paired with strategies aimed at assessing, then limiting/reversing ITH, may better optimize the rate and duration of response to therapy. The studies will be facilitated by a comprehensive library of patient-derived murine models and extensive clinical data sets and executed by a multidisciplinary team of clinical/laboratory investigators, pathologists, computational biologists, and others with a strong track record of innovation in SCLC and translating laboratory findings into the clinic.",2021-06-01T12:06:00Z,2026-05-31T12:05:00Z,PAR-19-361,nofo_PAR-19-361,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,HOUSTON,TX,UNITED STATES,sclc
U01CA256801,Optimizing Dual-Targeted and Dual-Armored CAR T Cells for Small Cell LungCancer,"ABSTRACT A patient's own T cells can be modified using gene therapy technology to express receptors, termed chimeric antigen receptors or CARs, which allow these immune T cells to recognize proteins on the tumor cell surface, and in turn allow these CAR modified T cells to recognize and kill the patient's own tumor cells. This approach has been successful in some hematological malignancies, however, it has not been successful to date in solid tumors including small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Two mechanisms by which SCLC may evade T cell-mediated killing are loss of expression of antigens, and suppression of T cell function in the tumor microenvironment. In this proposal, we will attempt to overcome these barriers by designing CAR T cells that target two SCLC antigens simultaneously, and that produce multiple factors (“armors”) that enhance T cell activity in solid tumors. We hypothesize that these dual-armored, dual targeted (DADT) CAR T cells will be more effective against SCLC than previous T cell-mediated and immune therapies. We have previously shown that CAR T cells targeted to either the antigen GD3 or to the antigen DLL3, both of which are expressed on the majority of small cell lung cancers, are capable of killing SCLC cells in preclinical systems. Additionally, we have developed multiple armored CAR T cells that secrete factors such as IL-18, or an antibody-derived single-chain variable fragment (scFv) that blocks the immune checkpoint receptor PD-1, or an scFv blocking the phagocytosis-inhibitory signal CD47 on tumor cells. All of these armors enhance CAR T cell activity in our in vivo model systems through different mechanisms. In Aim 1 of this proposal, we will generate CAR T cells targeting DLL3 and GD3 simultaneously, to overcome antigen heterogeneity and antigen loss in tumors as a means of escape from T cell-mediated killing. Simultaneously, in Aim 2, we will test pairs of armors to identify the pair that is the most effective at enhancing the activity of single antigen-targeted CAR T cells against SCLC in vivo in immunocompetent systems. We then analyze the immune cells in the SCLC tumor microenvironment following CAR T cell treatment to assess changes mediated by the armored CAR T cells. Ultimately, in Aim 3, we will combine these approaches to generate CAR T cells that recognize GD3 and DLL3 and produce multiple armors. These DADT CAR T cells for SCLC may be suitable for further preclinical testing in preparation for clinical trials beyond the scope of this proposal, representing a novel therapeutic approach to SCLC. Given our robust track record in CAR T cell clinical translation, we fully anticipate having new CAR T cells suitable for clinical trials at the conclusion of funding. Additionally, these novel CAR T cells may be used as tools to explore the interactions between T cells and the SCLC microenvironment. The analysis of changes in SCLC tumors induced by the armored CAR T cells proposed here may reveal novel aspects of SCLC biology and illuminate mechanisms of immune escape and treatment failure in SCLC.",2021-04-01T12:04:00Z,2026-03-31T12:03:00Z,PAR-19-361,nofo_PAR-19-361,ROSWELL PARK CANCER INSTITUTE CORP,BUFFALO,NY,UNITED STATES,sclc
U01CA258400,Development of Small Area Interactive Risk Maps for Cancer Control Efforts,"PROJECT SUMMARY This study will use a Bayesian hierarchical modeling statistical framework to obtain rates of new cancer cases and cancer deaths at the ZIP-code level, which will allow cancer control researchers and practitioners to focus their efforts on populations at greatest risk. The Bayesian hierarchical model will produce small area estimates by borrowing strength from neighboring ZIP-codes as well as over time. Typically, the ZIP-code levels would need to be combined to much larger regions to obtain sample sizes big enough to either de-identify individuals or stabilize the variance, or both. We employ a zero-inflated model since many ZIP-codes will have small and especially zero counts in a given year and age group. Given that the challenges of, and needs for, calculating small area cancer estimates is greatest in rural areas, we will focus on the largely rural states of Iowa, Kentucky, and New Mexico. We will then construct user friendly maps and other interactive graphics that can be tailored and included on cancer control/public health websites and develop communication and educational materials to promote the use of these maps for cancer control purposes. The result is an interactive visualization approach that displays age-adjusted cancer rates, risk of cancer relative to the state average, and levels of confidence, all at the small area ZIP-code level even for rural areas with small and zero counts. The probabilities and cancer risk estimates will be disseminated through a widely available platform that is easy to use and understand.",2022-06-15T12:06:00Z,2025-05-31T12:05:00Z,RFA-CA-21-014,nofo_RFA-CA-21-014,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,IOWA CITY,IA,UNITED STATES,itcr
U01CA258512,PROTEAN-CR: Proteomics Toolkit for Ensemble Analysis in Cancer Research,"Project Summary Understanding protein–ligand molecular interactions is fundamental to understanding the role of proteins in complex diseases such as cancer. For instance, there is growing interest in predicting the binding modes of peptide-based ligands (e.g., cyclic and phosphorylated peptides) to inhibit or induce targeted degradation of high-proﬁle cancer targets. Another promising example is the identiﬁcation of tumor-associated antigens for cancer immunotherapy applications. Both examples involve very speciﬁc molecular interactions, provide opportunities for computer-aided design of better cancer treatments, and highlight the need for structural analyses in cancer research. They also require new methods that account for the ﬂexibility and variability of the protein receptors involved in these molecular interactions. The objective of this project is to develop an integrated approach to the structural modeling and analysis of protein–ligand interactions in cancer research that will be implemented in the proteomics toolkit PROTEAN-CR. The proposed toolkit will adopt a data-science approach to the problem by introducing approaches for data acquisition and aggregation, as well as algorithmic advances for handling receptor ﬂexibility and for modeling driver mutations, drug-resistance polymorphisms, and post-translational modiﬁcations. PROTEAN-CR will streamline running structural analyses at scale while providing meaningful data analytics. The long-term goal of our research is to fully integrate three-dimensional structural information about proteins and ligands and structural analysis into cancer research. The PIs will work with collaborators to target a wide range of users, from experimentalists with little to no programming experience, to advanced users who are comfortable scripting large-scale analyses and integrating the toolkit with their own computational pipeline. The central hypothesis is that a uniﬁed data-science-inspired approach can be used to address major challenges in structural analysis of protein–ligand interactions in cancer research at scale. The ﬁrst aim will incorporate protein ﬂexibility in docking studies for cancer research. Speciﬁc workﬂows will be used to generate ensembles of protein conformations (receptor ﬂexibility) and innovative machine learning methods will be implemented aiming at a better scoring of protein–ligand complexes. The second aim will focus on including cancer variability into structural analysis. We aim to ﬁll the gap that exists between available data on cancer variants and the structural analysis of ensembles of tumor-associated mutations and protein modiﬁcations.

U01CA260432,Identification and characterization of cancer cell states by novel computational and experimental technologies - Resubmission - 1,"SUMMARY Tumors are complex systems composed of genetically and transcriptionally heterogeneous cells, and this heterogeneity has been implicated as a cause of drug resistance and overall mortality. Understanding intra- tumor heterogeneity is therefore likely to have widespread impact, both fundamental and clinical. The advent of single-cell RNA-Seq has led to the detection of transcriptionally distinct states among cancer cells across a wide range of tumor types and stages. However, the field lacks robust computational and experimental technologies to functionally identify and characterize these cancer cell states. In this project, we take a gene module-centric view to define cell states in a rigorous and widely applicable manner. We will validate the importance of each cell state using human samples and the zebrafish melanoma model, which has exceptional capabilities for imaging and perturbation of cell states throughout tumor progression and metastasis. To systematically characterize these cell states experimentally, we propose methods to assay their interdependencies within the tumor and with elements of the microenvironment. Our genetically engineered zebrafish will mark each cancer cell state with a fluorescent reporter and an ablation cassette, providing a flexible experimental platform to study and perturb each cell state. The reporter will enable us to sort cancer cell states and study them individually, with a particular emphasis on their plasticity. By systematically disrupting cancer cell states, we will further elucidate their individual contributions to tumor initiation, progression and metastasis. Using a spatial transcriptomics approach and integrating with single-cell RNA-seq data, we will map cancer cell states in relation to their microenvironment to screen for putative interactions. Finally, we will directly test predicted interactions between specific cancer cell states and the immune compartment using T cell-deficient fish. Throughout our three Aims, we adopt a systems biology workflow that iteratively cycles through modes of observations, perturbations, and refinement of our model of the functional role of cancer cell states during tumor progression. Our proposal collectively integrates the complementary expertise of the White and Yanai labs and sets out to significantly improve our understanding of intratumoral heterogeneity through the lens of cancer cell states.",2022-06-21T12:06:00Z,2027-05-31T12:05:00Z,PAR-19-287,nofo_PAR-19-287,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,NEW YORK,NY,UNITED STATES,csbc
U01CA263957,NCI Pediatric In Vivo Testing Program: Neuroblastoma,"Project Summary Children with disseminated neuroblastoma have a very high risk of treatment failure and death despite receiving intensified chemotherapy, radiation therapy and immunotherapy. The long-term goal of the Mossé and Maris translational research programs is to substantively improve neuroblastoma cure rates by developing patient-specific therapies that target the unique oncogenic drivers of each case. Within the context of the National Cancer Institute’s Pediatric In Vivo Testing Program (Ped-In Vivo-TP) we propose a Neuroblastoma Research Program built on richly annotated and highly characterized patient derived xenograft (PDX) and other recently developed murine models of this disease. The central hypothesis to be tested in this Program is that neuroblastoma-specific oncogenic drivers and optimal immunotherapeutic targets can be defined and exploited through rationally designed therapies based on validated and clinically measurable biomarkers. Through our dedicated focus on neuroblastoma and our central role in the former Pediatric Preclinical Testing Program and Consortium, we have developed an investigative team and rich set of resources and reagents to be uniquely positioned to achieve the goals of the Ped-In Vivo-TP. Here we propose to use a large (and growing) collection of PDX models that have been fully characterized with the most modern genomic technologies to address the challenge of prioritizing the large armamentarium of anti-cancer agents in development so that early phase biomarker-driven clinical trials can be designed with the objective of showing potent and specific anti-tumor activity. We propose three specific aims directed towards 1) developing and characterizing highly annotated models of human neuroblastoma; 2) performing preclinical trials with drugs directed against defined therapeutic vulnerabilities in order to prioritize agents for the clinic, and 3) developing the portfolio of preclinical data required for design of clinical trials with robust biomarkers for patient selection and monitoring. In collaboration with other preclinical testing programs, we will seek to determine if discoveries in our program are relevant to other childhood cancers and collaborate across disease groups on clinical development strategies. Thus, this Program will seek to shift the paradigm for how high-risk neuroblastoma patients are treated with the goal of substantively improving the outcomes, both in terms of cure rates, but also by decreasing the toxicity associated with current standards of care.",2021-07-01T12:07:00Z,2026-06-30T12:06:00Z,RFA-CA-20-034,nofo_RFA-CA-20-034,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,PHILADELPHIA,PA,UNITED STATES,pivot
U01CA263967,Pediatric Preclinical In Vivo Testing Center for Pediatric Sarcoma and Other Solid Tumors,"ABSTRACT With recent enactment of the Research to Accelerate Cures and Equity (RACE) for Children Act, there is a growing impetus to identify pediatric indications for molecularly targeted drugs. Accordingly, there is a pressing need for clinically relevant preclinical studies that can help prioritize pediatric indications for clinical application of nearly the entire universe of cancer drugs currently in development. To meet this need, we established a preclinical testing program that has created >300 genomically-characterized pediatric solid tumor patient- derived xenograft (PDX) models between the pediatric oncology programs at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and University of California San Francisco. We propose to leverage this large portfolio of models across a diversity of diseases, along with the deep expertise of the team, to establish a NCI Pediatric In Vivo Testing Program (Ped-In Vivo-TP) Research Team focused on pediatric bone and soft tissue sarcomas, renal tumors, desmoplastic small round cell tumor (DSRCT) and other rare pediatric solid tumors. The Aims of this Research Team are: Aim 1. Integrate with the Coordinating Center and other Research Teams to prioritize agents for preclinical evaluation. We will leverage our team's translational expertise as well as existing connections to disease committees within cooperative groups to inform and facilitate new agent selection and preclinical evaluation in appropriate models to prioritize agents to advance into pediatric oncology clinical trials. Aim 2. Utilize PDX portfolios representative of disease heterogeneity to assess therapeutic agents. We will utilize the >300 PDX models from MSKCC and UCSF, supplemented with models from the PROXC consortium where necessary, to assess 8-10 therapeutic agents/year using study designs matched to the therapeutic question. All preclinical drug testing will be conducted at MSKCC. Aim 3. Align central and local data analyses to ensure rigor in results reporting. For the purposes of prioritization, we will maintain equipoise in validating (“go”) or invalidating (“no go”) therapeutic hypotheses, and will complement central data analyses with advanced local biostatistical expertise. Aim 4. Translational biomarker discovery. We will leverage the combined expertise of our Research Team to identify clinically translatable biomarkers predictive of enhanced response or drug resistance. In some cases, predictive biomarkers may not be genetic, but instead will depend on transcriptional or protein-based assays of target activity. In other cases, genomically identified biomarkers have to be translated to clinically utilizable assays. Together, the expertise and capabilities of this Research Team will support the rigorous evaluation of novel therapeutic hypotheses in clinically-representative models to enable prioritization and translation of the most promising emerging agents into biomarker-informed clinical trials for children with high risk solid tumors.",2021-07-01T12:07:00Z,2026-06-30T12:06:00Z,RFA-CA-20-034,nofo_RFA-CA-20-034,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,NEW YORK,NY,UNITED STATES,pivot
U01CA263969,In Vivo Testing of Novel Drug Combinations for Pediatric Soft Tissue Sarcomas,"PROJECT SUMMARY Despite the advances made in our understanding of the etiology of pediatric soft tissue sarcomas (STS), the overall survival of those diseases has not significantly improved in over 2 decades. For children with recurrent disease, survival is below 30%, and long-term survivors have an increased burden of disease associated with the curative therapies they received. Therefore, the goal of our research team is to improve the survival and quality of life of children with STS by integrating basic, translational, and clinical research. For the past 10 years, we have consented STS and other solid tumor patients to donate tissue for orthotopic implantation into immunocompromised mice to develop orthotopic patient derived xenografts (O-PDXs). Our O-PDXs have been used for ex vivo high- throughput drug screening and in vivo testing using a standardized preclinical phase I, II, III paradigm. Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is the most common STS in children and genomic studies have shown that rare subsets of clonally related cells can survive treatment and contribute to disease recurrence. Subsequent integrated analyses using transcriptomic, epigenetic and proteomic data showed that RMS tumors retain lineage-specific transcriptional and epigenetic signatures of their developmental origins. More recently, single cell and single nucleus RNA-seq (sc/snRNA-seq) and in vivo lineage-tracing showed that clones of cells can transition through their normal developmental programs. Indeed, single- cell ATAC-seq demonstrated that the cell- and developmental stage–specific super-enhancer activity is correlated with those clonal changes in gene expression. Chemotherapy eliminates the most proliferative tumor cell populations, and the surviving dormant tumor cells rapidly expand and re- establish their developmental hierarchy, which leads to disease recurrence. This is a striking example of the complex cell-intrinsic and -extrinsic signaling within STS and the intricate connection between developmental and oncogenic pathways in childhood cancer. In this proposal, we will perform in vivo testing for 8-10 drugs per year using our STS O-PDX models. The most compelling pathways are developmental kinase pathways (Aim 1), cell stress pathways (Aim 2) and G2/M cell cycle checkpoints (Aim 3). Novel drug combinations will be tested as well as those that include conventional chemotherapy for standard of care. Particular emphasis will be placed on eliminating all the clones in the tumor to improve survival by reducing disease recurrence.",2021-07-01T12:07:00Z,2026-06-30T12:06:00Z,RFA-CA-20-034,nofo_RFA-CA-20-034,ST.

U01CA263981,"A Testing Program to Identify Novel Agents for Treatment of Pediatric and AYA High-Risk Sarcoma, Kidney and Liver Cancer","ABSTRACT Cancer in children is rare with approximately 15,700 new cases diagnosed annually in children 21 years or younger in the U.S. Through use of multimodality therapy (surgery, radiation therapy, and aggressive chemotherapy), 70% of patients will be `cured' of their disease, and 5-year Event-Free Survival (EFS) exceeds 80%. Consequently, the number of patients that can be enrolled in phase I/II clinical trials is small, and most patients will have been extensively treated, hence drug/radiation resistant. Thus, preclinical studies that accurately translate into effective clinical therapy are an essential component of pediatric drug development. Our group has contributed to studies in the PPTP/C that have led to clinical studies through Children's Oncology Group (COG). Of importance, we have developed and characterized over 330 Patient Derived Xenografts (PDX), developed from tumors both at diagnosis and relapse, that can be used to facilitate pediatric drug development as directed by FDA under the Research to Accelerate Cures and Equity for Children Act (RACE for Children Act). Based on our studies, both in and outside the PPTC, we propose to use PDX/CDX models of sarcoma, kidney cancer, and hepatoblastoma derived from high-risk patients to identify novel agents and combinations, and to test at least 8-10 agents per year, for which we have expertise. We will explore specific hypotheses to integrate molecular-targeted agents with conventional chemo-radiation treatment, advanced drug delivery systems (antibody-drug conjugates, nanoparticles), and the use of Single Mouse Testing (SMT) as the primary screening approach. In collaborative studies, we will evaluate a new humanized mouse model where testing of immuno-oncology agents is a priority to treat these PDX models. One of the objective limitations of PPTP/C testing was that relatively few tumor models representing a specific disease (n=3-8/disease) could be used within the resource constraints, a number clearly insufficient to recapitulate the genetic/epigenetic heterogeneity of each clinical disease. Our retrospective analysis of PPTP data, and recent prospective testing in the PPTC, shows that a single mouse/tumor line gives essentially similar data to conventional testing' (using 10 mice/group for each tumor line). The advantage of the SMT design is that it allows for incorporation of up to 20-fold more models, more accurately representing the genetic/epigenetic diversity of each pediatric cancer within the same resource constraints. The proposed studies will adopt SMT as the primary screening approach to identify agents that have biologically meaningful activity (i.e. large antitumor effects) and identify tumors that are `exceptional responders' for validation. The SMT approach, when linked to the molecular characterization of PDX models, potentially increases the power to identify biomarkers associated with response. Using SMT we can essentially conduct preclinical phase II trials and simulate the likely clinical response rate more accurately for a given disease. As part of the Ped-In Vivo-TP, we aim to develop highly effective, less toxic therapies for high-risk cancers that afflict children and adolescents/young adults (AYA).",2021-09-01T12:09:00Z,2026-06-30T12:06:00Z,RFA-CA-20-034,nofo_RFA-CA-20-034,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCIENCE CENTER,SAN ANTONIO,TX,UNITED STATES,pivot
U01CA264071,muMS2: an open source R package for analyzing and integrating multi-omics datasets to improve early detection and understanding of colorectal cancer,"One in every 20 Americans develops colorectal cancer (CRC) and, once diagnosed, more than one-third will not survive 5 years. Although screening is available, stool assays such as fecal immunochemical test (FIT) and Cologuard have true positive rates ranging between 64-68% and false positive rate ranging between 5-10%. Moreover, other approaches such as colonoscopy are invasive and expensive and have low rates of patient adherence. There is clearly a need for additional biomarkers that complement existing screening procedures to identify individuals for subsequent colonoscopy and to better understand the biology that gives rise to tumors. Untargeted metabolomics has become an increasingly common approach to identify sources of such biomarkers from fecal samples; however, the general approach researchers use to analyze the data excludes the 95% of metabolites that currently lack an annotation. Animal models of CRC and human population studies have indicated that the gut microbiota has an underappreciated role in the disease. Therefore, it is critical that we characterize the metabolites generated by the gut microbiota to better understand the disease. The long-term goal of this research is to develop biomarkers that improve the detection of CRC and our understanding of the mechanisms that increase the risk of developing CRC. The objective of this proposal is to develop an open source R package, mums2, that allows researchers to identify metabolic biomarkers that can be associated with cancer regardless of whether they have already been annotated or whether they are produced by human or microbial cells. With this package, we will incorporate tools that allow researchers to implement the current state of the art for analyzing untargeted metabolomics and we will develop and validate methods for improving the quantification of MS features and clustering unknown metabolites based on their structural similarity. Three specific aims are proposed: (i) develop the mums2 R package, (ii) construct a predictive abundance algorithm for more accurate quantification of MS feature abundance, and (iii) construct operational metabolomics units (OMUs) as a framework for clustering unknown metabolites by structural similarity. Successful completion of these aims will result in a new platform for analyzing CRC metabolomics data for identifying biomarkers and understanding the underlying biology of tumorigenesis. To support this framework, we will create an open source R package, mums2, which will be useful for the expanding cancer microbiome and biomarker community. This package will democratize metabolomic analyses to broaden their adoption, reduce costs, improve the rigor and reproducibility of analyses, and enhance the ability to perform untargeted metabolomics analyses using a variety of biospecimens. Finally, the most important next step will be to apply these methods to better understand the interaction between the metabolome, microbiome, and tumorigenesis to identify diagnostic biomarkers and better understand the progression of CRC disease. The approaches and goals of the proposed research complement existing Informatics Technology for Cancer Research (ITCR) projects.",2022-06-01T12:06:00Z,2025-05-31T12:05:00Z,RFA-CA-21-014,nofo_RFA-CA-21-014,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,ANN ARBOR,MI,UNITED STATES,itcr
U01CA264583,Spatial and temporal tumor-immune co-evolution and interactions that model lung adenocarcinoma development,"PROJECT SUMMARY Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is the most frequent subtype of lung cancer and accounts for most cancer deaths. Improved early detection has increased the number of LUADs diagnosed at earlier pathological stages, thus warranting strategies to treat this growing patient subpopulation. Thwarting these advances is a very poor understanding of early events that drive LUAD development and that thus would guide ideal approaches for interception. While normal lung epithelia of LUAD patients were shown to display tumor-pertinent molecular and inflammatory changes, it is not clear why a LUAD develops within a particular region in the lung. Whereas the lung is ecologically rich with many cell populations that partake in both physiological and pathological processes, we still do not know how the properties and roles of individual cell populations, such as epithelial and immune subsets, co-evolve and interact to instigate LUAD development from a specific niche in the lung. In our preliminary efforts, we found by multi-region single-cell sequencing remarkable evolution of the properties and transcriptomic features of multiple cell subsets and states (e.g., protumor immunosuppressive phenotypes) across macro-space, such that cellular ecosystems and immune cell receptor repertoires were more similar among LUADs and adjacent normal regions than with more distant normal sites. Also, such spatial properties were progressively enriched along the pathologic continuum of matched human normal lung, to preneoplasias, up to invasive LUADs. Our preliminary findings motivate the hypothesis that geospatially and temporally evolving expression programs, properties, and interplay of epithelial and immune cells model early development of LUAD from the normal and premalignant lung. In Aim 1, we will study LUADs and matched multi-region normal tissues with defined spatial proximities from the tumors by single-cell RNA and immune receptor sequencing in conjunction with analysis of mutations in the tumors to establish single-cell maps of LUAD and immune co-evolution in space. Spatially modulated cell properties and states will then be used to feed and train a machine learning model that portrays LUAD development from the lung ecosystem. In Aim 2, we will single-cell decode tumor-immune co-evolution along the pathologic continuum of normal and premalignant lung to LUAD as well as identify cell states and properties that are modulated by early immune intervention. We will use temporal information in mice, along with human matched normal lung tissues, preneoplastic lesions, and invasive LUADs, to iteratively validate and fine-tune the performance of our machine learning model to portray LUAD development in time from the normal and premalignant lung. At the end of our studies, we will have built new models that reliably portray LUAD evolution in space and time. By providing an atlas of LUAD development in an accessible data portal, we also expect that our study will offer scalable roadmaps for the scientific community to develop new strategies for treatment of this fatal disease.",2022-07-01T12:07:00Z,2027-06-30T12:06:00Z,PAR-19-287,nofo_PAR-19-287,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,HOUSTON,TX,UNITED STATES,csbc
U01CA264610,Clonal Therapy for Pediatric T-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Pediatric T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (pT-ALL), with limited treatment options, has been historically associated with inferior treatment outcomes with chemotherapy, compared to B-cell ALL. Despite the advances made in our understanding of the etiology of pT-ALL, the overall survival of this disease has not significantly improved. Children with recurrent T-ALL have a dismal survival rate of < 25%, and long-term survivors have an increased burden of disease associated with the curative chemotherapies they received. Therefore, novel targeted therapeutics in combinations are much needed. Population-based genomic and transcriptomic studies have revealed the inter-leukemia diversity of pT-ALL. However, very little is known about intra-leukemia clonal heterogeneity in pT-ALL that were known to contribute to drug resistance and disease recurrence. For example, it remains mysterious what molecular and cellular features of the rare clones have to allow them to survive treatment as other major clones are eliminated. T-ALL arises during the dynamic developmental processes and retains hallmarks of their cellular origins. However, it remains unclear how T-cell development contributes to clonal heterogeneity of pT-ALL. Moreover, whether cell–cell communications between cancer cells and normal cells in the tumor microenvironment contribute to disease recurrence is unclear. Using bulk systems pharmacology and single-cell systems biology approaches, we discovered the leukemia heterogeneity associated with T-cell maturation and drug sensitivity in single cells. Therefore, we hypothesize that clonal therapy by targeting signaling networks in clonal subpopulations arising from T-cell differentiation will minimize relapsed/refractory diseases and improve outcomes for pT-ALL. Our team at St. Jude is uniquely positioned to tackle these challenges, capitalizing on vast expertise in systems biology, ALL pharmacogenomics, and T-cell development. Specifically, in this proposal, we will determine how T-cell development contributes to the intra-leukemia heterogeneity in pT-ALL (Aim 1). We will map clones in pT-ALL to T-cell maturation stages by single-cell analyses of primary samples and normal developmental T cells. We will identify clone-specific hidden drivers that drive clonal heterogeneity and drug sensitivity. Next, we will identify drug combinations that target signaling drivers in multiple clones (Aim 2). We will integrate bulk systems pharmacology with single-cell hidden-driver analyses to unbiasedly predict synergistic drug combinations and validate them by drug screening. We will use patient-derived xenografts that retain clonal complexity for in vivo validation. We will also investigate how TME reprograming modulates clone selection with treatment in pT-ALL (Aim 3). We will reconstruct the tumor and TME communication network from scRNA-seq data and elucidate the molecular mechanisms of clonal selection with treatment in pT-ALL. Taken together, this project will address fundamental unanswered questions in intra- leukemia clonality and provide a new clonal therapy approach that eliminates multiple clones, including those that contribute to disease recurrence, thereby, improves the outcomes for children with T-ALL.",2021-09-16T12:09:00Z,2026-08-31T12:08:00Z,PAR-19-287,nofo_PAR-19-287,ST.

U01CA264611,Systems analysis of mechanisms driving response to immunotherapy in clear cell cancers,"Clear cell ovarian cancer (ccOC) is a rare and lethal cancer with few treatment options. Based on molecular analysis ccOC appears intrinsically immunogenic but with an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, similar to other ovarian cancer types. However, ccOC is very distinct from high grade serous ovarian carcinoma. Strikingly, it is similar in gene expression profiles to more frequent clear cell renal cell carcinomas (ccRCC), suggesting that clear cell cancers share intrinsic mechanistic or microenvironment properties, not just morphological appearance. Around 25% of ccRCC respond well to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), but markers for predicting response are lacking. The objective response rate for monotherapy pembrolizumab in one study was 33.3% for ccOC patients; but, in general, it is unknown which clear cell cancer patients could benefit from ICI treatment. Recent work has shown that tumor behavior is driven not just by cellular composition, but also by the spatial organization of different cell types including immune and stromal cells, as well as malignant cells themselves. Knowledge of clear cell cancer tumor microenvironments and their spatial architecture is lacking. Addressing this gap will improve our understanding of mechanisms of response to ICIs in clear cell cancers, including rare ones like ccOC, and improve selection of patients for immunotherapy. This study will use systems biology approaches to (i) elucidate and compare the cell types and their transcriptional states present in ccOC and ccRCC; (ii) characterize the spatial architecture of these cells within tumors using the CODEX (CODetection by indEXing) single cell proteomic imaging platform; and (iii) model and validate cell-cell interactions in the spatial tumor microenvironment that drive clear cell cancer response to immunotherapy through extensions of causal signaling inference algorithms to incorporate spatial context, and to optimize experimental validations in mouse models that maximize the information gain about interaction networks. Similar intrinsic and tumor microenvironmental features shared by ccOC and ccRCC, will nominate common mechanisms of immunotherapy response, and identify the subset of both who might benefit from treatment with ICIs. Successful development and application of these methods to clear cell cancers will establish a framework that can be applied to other cancer types, notably to rare ones. The expected outcome of this proposal is a comprehensive definition and dissection of the tumor microenvironment of ccRCC and ccOC. It will identify common features and mechanisms between these clear cell cancers, providing a basis to extend the approach to other classes of cancer, opening new avenues for treatment, particularly in rare cancer types.",2022-09-13T12:09:00Z,2027-08-31T12:08:00Z,PAR-19-287,nofo_PAR-19-287,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,STANFORD,CA,UNITED STATES,csbc
U01CA264620,Mechanism of estrogen independent proliferation in ER+ breast cancer cells,"Abstract Combining cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors with endocrine therapy improves outcomes for metastatic estrogen receptor positive (ER+), HER2 negative, breast cancer patients. However, the value of this combination in potentially curable earlier stage patients is variable. Our preliminary results examined the evolutionary trajectories of early stage breast cancer tumors using single cell transcriptomic profiling of serial tumor biopsies from a clinical trial of preoperative endocrine therapy alone (letrozole) or in combination with the cell cycle inhibitor ribociclib. Resistant tumors with accelerated loss of estrogen signaling show up-regulation of the JNK pathway, while those that maintain estrogen signaling during therapy show potentiation of CDK4/6 activation consistent with ERBB4 and ERK signaling up-regulation. Cell cycle reconstruction identified that tumors cells can reactivate during combination treatment, indicating stronger selection for a proliferative state. We hypothesize that resistance to CDK4/6 inhibition in earlier stage breast cancer is driven by JNK MAPK pathway stimulation and reactivation of the cell cycle through promotion of CDK6 expression or decreased cell cycle inhibitor function. In Aim 1, we will use a new mechanistic model of CDK4/6 regulation by cell cycle Inhibitors and Promoters (CIP) that couples estrogen and JNK signaling with cell cycle progression to measure the mechanisms driving cell cycle activation in a series of isogenic cell lines sensitive and resistant to CDK4/6 and endocrine inhibitors and in patient tumor cells. This analysis will reveal how distinct signaling pathways contribute to cell cycle reactivation during estrogen, CDK4/6 and JNK inhibition treatments and provide signatures of each resistant mechanism across cell types, over time and between systems. Aim 2 leverages our collection of patient tumors from the FELINE clinical trial to discover the intracellular and intratumoral resistance mechanisms driving proliferation. Fundamental resistance mechanisms will be measured in over ~300,000 patient cells from 360 tumor samples using single cell RNA sequencing data already in hand to identify core intracellular signaling states that act alone or in concert to drive proliferation. Next, the population of cells within each tumor will be analyzed to quantify intratumoral heterogeneity and how resistant populations differ in growing or shrinking tumors during drug treatment. Applying CIP to project proliferation across patient tumor cells will allow prediction of inhibitor strategies that most effectively block intracellular and intratumoral proliferation. Lastly, Aim 3 will apply a series of JNK pathway drugs with clinical potential to design and test treatment strategies that maintain durable inhibition of proliferation in ER+ cancer cells. Iterative feedback between mathematical models and patient/experimental data serves to provide a deep understanding of cell cycle regulation and mechanisms of dysregulation leading to resistance. Together, these experiments will reveal the balance between estrogen and alternative mediated JNK signaling, and their roles in resistance and provide a guide for therapeutic regimes with more durable control of cancer cell proliferation.",2021-09-01T12:09:00Z,2026-08-31T12:08:00Z,PAR-19-287,nofo_PAR-19-287,BECKMAN RESEARCH INSTITUTE/CITY OF HOPE,DUARTE,CA,UNITED STATES,csbc
U01CA268052,Cellular plasticity gives rise to phenotypic equilibrium in small cell lung carcinoma,"ABSTRACT Small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) is one of the most intractable human cancers to cure. It is an aggressive tumor characterized by rapid growth, metastatic progression, and initial response followed by almost invariable resistance to therapy. Studies to date have not resolved the extent that diverse genetic and epigenetic programs drive SCLC and contribute to its lethality. We combined one of the largest and most diverse inventories of patient-derived xenograft models of SCLC globally with an ex vivo culture system that maintains transcriptional fidelity with matched primary SCLC tumor to identify distinct and dynamic phenotypic states that differ in functional attributes within individual tumors. We show that human SCLC tumors display distinctive equilibria in the proportion of cells in various phenotypic (not merely transcriptional) states. We also show that SCLC states are highly regulated by multivalent cellular plasticity and we measure the kinetics of this plasticity at the single cell level. Importantly, standard of care chemotherapies in this disease preferentially kill specific cancer cell states. In this proposal, we posit that understanding the facets of SCLC's intratumoral heterogeneity will: 1) contribute to our understanding of a poorly characterized aspect of cancer heterogeneity; 2) reveal how stochasticity and/or ecological cues in single-cell behaviors promote phenotypic equilibrium in cancer populations; 3) provide insight into the biological and clinical behavior of SCLC; and 4) advance desperately needed new therapeutic strategies of epigenetic reprogramming in this recalcitrant disease. Our team of investigators have content expertise in several computational, experimental, and translational methods pertinent to this proposal including human-derived in vivo and ex vivo model systems, single-cell RNA sequencing, bulk genetic and expression analysis, single cell fluorescence tracking, and mathematical and statistical modeling. Our integrative approach is poised to formulate and validate a unified model of cellular states and program diversity in SCLC. If successful, the characterization of malignant cell ontogenic programs (SA1), their plasticity (SA2), and the advancement of new therapies designed to combat plasticity by epigenetic reprogramming (SA3) will advance a unique scientific canvas for the study of this highly lethal disease.",2022-09-01T12:09:00Z,2027-08-31T12:08:00Z,PAR-19-361,nofo_PAR-19-361,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,CHICAGO,IL,UNITED STATES,sclc
U01CA268066,Translating Autoantibodies Into Chimeric Antigen Receptor-T cell Therapy for Small Cell Lung Cancer,"Abstract For the last 30 years, the 5-year survival rate of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) has been less than 7% despite the addition of immune checkpoint inhibitors as treatment options. Therapies like immune checkpoint inhibitors that aim to reengage an immune response may not succeed for SCLC as previous studies have shown downregulation of MHC molecules, low PD-L1 expression and limited immune infiltration. However, SCLC is often associated with autoantibody-driven Paraneoplastic Syndromes, providing evidence for the immunogenicity of SCLC. We propose that chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-Ts) as a novel approach for SCLC immunotherapy that overcomes impediments to endogenous immunity. CAR-Ts are synthetically engineered to fuse antibody ligand binding domains with costimulatory components that activate T cells after engagement of cell surface antigens, and have had considerable success in leukemia, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma. The microenvironment of SCLC is phenotypically closer to CAR-T responsive lymphoma than many solid tumors where CAR-Ts have thus far had limited success. A challenge for CAR-T cells in many solid tumors is the identification of target antigens that are tumor-specific. We have identified 13 novel cell surface antigen and here will prioritize 3 with high prevalence in SCLC. Each of these antigens have post-translational modifications that act as neoantigens and lead to autoantibody production in a high percentage of SCLC cases. We will capture these neoantigen-autoantibodies from SCLC patient-derived B cells, sequence the tumor specific binding sequences, and design and test CARs constructed from the single chain variable fragments (scFvs). The benefit of isolating autoantibodies from SCLC patients to detect tumor-specific neoantigens is three-fold: 1. The antigens identified have already proven to be immunogenic; 2. The variable regions of these human autoantibodies can be directly engineered into ligand binding domains of CAR-T cells; and 3. Autoantibodies can be detected in the blood of patients and serve as tissue surrogate biomarkers to guide CAR-T cell target selection. The CAR-T cells we develop will be rigorously tested in multiple preclinical models that address complementary but non-overlapping therapeutic barriers. These include testing CAR-T cell tumor infiltration, efficacy and toxicity in a library of genetically diverse SCLC patient derived xenografts and identifying, then overcoming, immunosuppressive mechanisms in the immune competent Rb/p53 genetically engineered mouse model.

U01CA269110,Developing informatics tools for optimized MRS for brain cancer research,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This project proposes to develop methods for automated, real-time, single-voxel magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) in brain tumors, integrate these methods with a clinical MRI system, evaluate their performance, and distribute them as open-source tools to the research community. MRS can provide metabolic information noninvasively for assessment of tumor phenotype and therapeutic response. Single-voxel MRS methods provide the best quality and most reliable data, but require the scanner operator to have a high skill level and expertise to produce good quality results. The need for this expert involvement in both acquisition and processing remains a critical barrier to the translation of MRS methods to clinical research sites without spectroscopy experts and to clinical practice. The first part of this project is to develop a method for 3D voxel placement using image guidance, integrate this method with a clinical MR system, and evaluate its performance. In the second part, we will automate our advanced MRS methods. In the third part, we will create real-time, automatic quantification tool specific to the obtained MRS data that will provide clinically interpretable results. We identified collaborators, the brain cancer researchers and clinicians, who will be early adopters and beta-testers of our tools. Successful completion of this project will improve data robustness and quality, eliminating the need for the expert interaction at the time of the scan and enabling adoption of MRS in multi- site clinical trials and clinical practice.",2022-09-07T12:09:00Z,2025-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-21-014,nofo_RFA-CA-21-014,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,MINNEAPOLIS,MN,UNITED STATES,itcr
U01CA269409,A data-driven bioinformatics platform for the design and analysis of multiplexed antibody-based cytometry experiments in cancer research,"ABSTRACT Tumor progression, resistance to therapy, and metastasis are closely related to the characteristics of the tumor cell ecosystem. Multiplexed antibody-based cytometry is the standard method for phenotypic characterization of tissue composition, pathogenesis, and immune infiltration with single-cell (and sometimes spatial) resolution. The identification of cell populations in these data is facilitated by algorithms that cluster cells according to their antigenic profile, as well as by predefined sets of markers that have historically evolved by trial and error. However, the annotation of these data is a manual, subjective, and laborious process that hinders the reproducibility and accuracy of the results. The design of antibody panels that include specific markers for all cell types and states present in a tissue is usually unfeasible, and the efficiency of commonly used markers is unknown. Consequently, cell clusters can differ little in their antigenic profile or contain a mixture of cell types. To overcome these limitations, this project will develop informatics technologies that leverage existing single-cell transcriptomic atlases to assist and automate the design and analyses of multiplexed antibody-based cytometry experiments. Our working hypothesis is that the vast amount of available single-cell transcriptomic data of tissues can inform the design, annotation, and analysis of cytometry experiments. We will develop and evaluate informatics technologies for establishing reference antigenic profiles and optimal antibody panels based on single-cell proteotranscriptomic data (Aim 1 ), and for automating the identification, annotation, and gating of cell populations in multiplexed antibody-based cytometry experiments (Aim 2). These new computational methods will enable any researcher to 1) automatically identify and annotate cell populations in a cytometry dataset based on reference single-cell data hosted in a repository, 2) define optimal gates for sorting cell populations, 3) transfer gates across experiments, 4) design optimal antibody panels for a given tissue or set of cell populations, and 5) infer the gene expression profile of cells. We will implement these methods in an open-source software and online portal for the transcriptome-guided annotation and analysis of cytometry data of tumors, and will closely work with end-users through several planned workshops and tutorials to maximize the utility and outreach of this platform (Aim 3). We will test our platform on leukemic and pancreatic cancer tissues profiled with spectral flow cytometry and multiplexed quantitative immunohistochemistry. The informatics technologies developed in this project will transform cancer research by boosting the phenotypic resolution, accuracy, and reproducibility of multiplexed antibody-based cytometry analyses of tumor tissues.",2022-09-01T12:09:00Z,2025-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-21-014,nofo_RFA-CA-21-014,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,PHILADELPHIA,PA,UNITED STATES,itcr
U01CA269420,GEARBOx - a multisite clinical trial matching tool for children with relapsed or refractory cancer,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Despite a steady rise in cure rates, cancer remains deadly for many children, especially those with relapsed or refractory disease. Precision medicine holds great promise for these kids, but matching children to available clinical trials remains a challenge due a lack of up-to-date information and highly complex eligibility criteria based on clinical information and genomic and immunophenotype biomarker data. In collaboration with The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, the Pediatric Cancer Data Commons (PCDC) team has developed GEARBOx (Genomic Eligibility Algorithm at Relapse for Better Outcomes), a clinical trial matching tool to allow clinicians to quickly find potential matches for their patients with relapsed or refractory acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). We now endeavor to expand GEARBOx to include several more tumor types, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia, neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, and osteosarcoma. Additionally, we will augment the often-manual abstraction of eligibility criteria from clinical trials with new automated methods. The information available to clinicians about trials will be supplemented to include critical data for how to quickly and efficiently enroll a child on a matched study. Finally, the PCDC team will partner with a third-party flow cytometry lab (Hematologics) to create ways to automatically pull and incorporate structured immunophenotype data directly into the GEARBOx tool. These enhancements will greatly enhance the process of finding appropriate clinical trials for patients and then getting them enrolled, thus improving access to critical precision therapy for these children.",2022-09-21T12:09:00Z,2025-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-21-014,nofo_RFA-CA-21-014,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,CHICAGO,IL,UNITED STATES,itcr
U01CA271273,Interrogation of the Impact of Selection on the Evolution of Human Pancreatic Cancer Precursor Lesions,"Project Summary Pancreatic cancer arises from precancerous lesions that are curable if detected and treated early enough. Recent multi-region genomic analyses of one type of precancerous pancreatic lesion, intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN), suggest unique evolutionary and selective pressures in IPMNs compared to invasive cancers, underscoring the potential importance of selection in the progression of precancerous lesions. We propose to characterize the role of selective forces in IPMNs using comprehensive molecular analyses and computational data integration of both human IPMN tissue samples and organoid cultures. We will determine the molecular features of progressed subclones in human IPMN samples using multi-region whole genome sequencing and RNA-sequencing. In addition, we will develop and apply novel multi-omics computational methods to integrate DNA and RNA-sequencing data to delineate selective forces in human IPMNs. We will determine the function of progressed clones identified by whole genome DNA sequencing with gene signatures inferred from bulk transcriptional data in a new semi-supervised framework. We will then employ a three-dimensional in vitro organoid culture model of human IPMN cells to characterize the relative contributions of selective pressures over time. We will use combined DNA sequencing and single-cell RNA- sequencing to identify gene expression signatures of progressed subclones in our organoid model, further adapting our computational framework to single cell RNA-sequencing data. Taken together, the proposed studies combine direct analysis of human tissue samples and manipulation of human precancerous cells in three-dimensional culture with novel multi-omics computational integration to greatly expand our knowledge of the role of selection in pancreatic cancer precursor lesions.",2022-09-15T12:09:00Z,2027-08-31T12:08:00Z,PAR-19-287,nofo_PAR-19-287,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,BALTIMORE,MD,UNITED STATES,csbc
U01CA271277,TeleHealth Resistance exercise Intervention to preserve dose intensity and Vitality in Elder breast cancer patients (THRIVE),"Project Summary/Abstract More than 276,480 women were diagnosed with breast cancer in 2020, with 120,000 cases occurring in women 65 years or older. Given the increasing median age of the US population, the number of breast cancers diagnosed in older women is expected to rise by 50% in the coming decades. Older women with breast cancer experience worse breast cancer-specific outcomes as compared to younger women, under-treatment is likely to play a central role. Studies have demonstrated that breast cancer patients who receive <85% of received dose intensity (RDI), a metric that combines the total dose administered with adherence to the planned treatment schedule, have a 57% increase in the risk of disease recurrence at 10 years as compared to women who receive at least 85% RDI. Only 50-76% of breast cancer patients >65 receive an RDI >85, largely due to increased toxicity of therapy in these patients. Reducing treatment-related toxicity to enhance RDI is critical to improving disease outcomes among the growing population of older breast cancer patients. To this end, models predicting for severe chemotoxicity demonstrate that a number of potentially modifiable factors (commonly assessed as part of the geriatric assessment), are important determinants of chemotoxicity, including function, depression, and falls (or use of assistive devices). Exercise has a significant positive impact on each of these modifiable factors, in the general population and in cancer patients. However, data on the ability of exercise interventions to improve treatment tolerance and preserve dose intensity among older breast cancer patients are lacking. We propose a randomized controlled trial to assess the effects of a multicomponent, hybrid telehealth (TH) exercise and protein intake support (the THRIVE Intervention) on RDI, incidence and severity of chemotoxicities, functional status, muscle mass, and patient reported outcomes in 270 breast cancer patients age ≥ 65 receiving neo/adjuvant chemotherapy. Participants will be randomized to the THRIVE Intervention or to a Health Education and Support control group. The intervention will be delivered through a hybrid model, leveraging the existing Breast Cancer Weight Loss (BWEL) Trial call center. After 2 in-person, onsite exercise sessions, we will transition to TH sessions delivered on study provided tablets, by certified exercise coaches who will tailor behavior change to support adherence relative to symptom burden. To optimize intervention effectiveness, participants will undergo a TH evaluation of diet adequacy with a registered dietitian, focused on optimal daily protein intake. Protein supplementation will be provided if needed to achieve 1.2 gm/kg daily intake. The TH focus consolidates expertise at a well-established call center (BWEL), elevating the potential for broad implementation across the U.S., including cancer treatment centers with too few patients to justify necessary personnel. The project also seeks to evaluate intervention cost, as well as the facilitators and barriers to implementation of this TH intervention, toward the goal of translation to clinical practice upon successful completion of the THRIVE trial.",2022-04-11T12:04:00Z,2027-03-31T12:03:00Z,RFA-CA-21-031,nofo_RFA-CA-21-031,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,PITTSBURGH,PA,UNITED STATES,enicto
U01CA271278,Trial of Exercise and Lifestyle (TEAL) in Women with Ovarian Cancer,"Project Abstract/Summary Ovarian cancer (OC) is the most lethal gynecologic malignancy, with disparities in survival by race and ethnicity. Nearly all stages of OC require aggressive treatment, such that 90% of women diagnosed receive chemotherapy. First-line treatment includes surgery and six cycles of platinum- and taxane-based chemotherapy. Timely and successful completion of chemotherapy is critical, as delayed or reduced chemotherapy dosage for OC is associated with decreased survival; yet chemotherapy dose delays and dose reductions are common. The primary reason for dose delays and reductions is chemotoxicity, including neuropathy, cognitive dysfunction, fatigue, depression, arthralgia, and gastrointestinal toxicities. Muscle loss is an additional consequence of chemotherapy in women with OC. Strategies to manage chemotoxicities include nutrition and exercise. Our team has extensive experience in leading multi-site nutrition and exercise interventions in women with OC and relevant experience with trials specifically addressing chemotherapy completion rates. We will leverage this expertise to address a critical gap: how to reduce chemotoxicity and treatment delays in women with OC. We propose to conduct a multi-site randomized trial of an 18-week medical nutrition therapy and exercise intervention vs. attention control in a racially and ethnically diverse sample of 200 women newly diagnosed with OC (stage I-IV) and initiating curative intent chemotherapy to assess the effect of the intervention on: Aim 1: Relative dose intensity (RDI), an integrated measure of chemotherapy dose delays and reductions; Aim 2: Patient-reported chemotoxicities including neuropathy, cognitive function, depression, fatigue, arthralgia, and gastrointestinal disturbances; Aim 3: Body composition and muscle mass assessed via CT scans and urinary D3‐Creatine dilution method; and Aim 4: Long-term lifestyle behaviors, body composition, patient-reported chemotoxicities, and health care utilization assessed 3- months post-intervention and 12-months post-diagnosis. We hypothesize women randomized to intervention will have higher RDI as compared to women in the attention control arm because of fewer patient-reported chemotoxicities. The intervention will result in attenuated declines in body composition compared with attention control, and women randomized to the intervention will maintain healthy lifestyle behaviors long-term, in turn favorably impacting lingering chemotoxicities and body composition, resulting in less health care utilization compared with attention control. Strengths of our approach is that baseline, follow-up visits and the intervention duration are timed with standard of care in that first-line chemotherapy is completed at ~18 weeks (when our primary endpoint will be assessed) with women undergoing repeat imaging assessments at this timepoint and 3 months later. Positive results would accelerate a paradigm shift with OC patients receiving nutrition and exercise programming as standard of care in tandem with chemotherapy treatment to minimize chemotoxicity and optimize treatment dose delivery for a curative outcome.",2022-05-23T12:05:00Z,2027-04-30T12:04:00Z,RFA-CA-21-031,nofo_RFA-CA-21-031,YALE UNIVERSITY,NEW HAVEN,CT,UNITED STATES,enicto
U01CA271279,Adaptive Randomization of Aerobic Exercise During Chemotherapy in Colon Cancer,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Patients with colon cancer who require chemotherapy dose reductions and treatment delays are twice as likely to experience disease recurrence and death than patients who complete their full chemotherapy dose on time. Up to 60% of patients develop toxicities of sufficient severity to require chemotherapy dose reductions or treatment delays. We hypothesize that aerobic exercise improves chemotherapy relative dose intensity and reduces patient-reported chemotherapy toxicities by improving the calibration of chemotherapy through changes in body composition and altering immune function. In response to RFA-CA-21-031, we will conduct a Bayesian, multi-stage, response-adaptive, dose-ranging trial of aerobic exercise. Participants will be 219 stage II-III colon cancer survivors recruited from three diverse socioeconomic, racial, and geographic regions (Baton Rouge, LA; Boston, MA; Oakland, CA). The first 80 participants are randomized to 1 of 5 groups equally: moderate-intensity aerobic exercise at 75 min/wk, 150 min/wk, 225 min/wk, 300 min/wk, or attention control (stretching). This is followed by adaptive randomization in which subsequent participants are assigned to an exercise group in a ratio proportional to the probability that the specific exercise group improves chemotherapy dose intensity and is feasible. Exercise is chemotherapy-periodized with more and less demanding weeks to accommodate cyclical variations in patient-reported symptoms. Aim 1 will evaluate the dose-response effects of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise compared with attention control on chemotherapy relative dose intensity (primary endpoint). Aim 2 will determine the effect of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise compared with control on gastrointestinal and peripheral neuropathy symptoms assessed using the Patient-Reported Outcomes version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [PRO-CTCAE (key secondary endpoint)]. Aim 3 will determine the effect of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise compared with control on whole-body tissue distribution (total body fat mass and lean mass) measured using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Aim 4 will determine the effect of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise compared with control on changes in neutrophil counts, phenotypes, and functions (biomarkers of neutrophil effector functions including elastase, citrullinated Histone H3, and myeloperoxidase and direct measures of chemotaxis and oxidative burst). This study will leverage a transdisciplinary team's synergies to identify an exercise prescription that is patient-centered and proven to have a high probability of clinical benefit. This study will directly inform clinical practice guidelines that recognize exercise as an essential supportive care intervention for chemotherapy and establish exercise training as obligatory for delivering high-quality, evidence-based care to colon cancer survivors.",2022-06-03T12:06:00Z,2027-05-31T12:05:00Z,RFA-CA-21-031,nofo_RFA-CA-21-031,LSU PENNINGTON BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH CTR,BATON ROUGE,LA,UNITED STATES,enicto
U01CA271287,Dose-response of aerobic training during total neoadjuvant therapy for locally advanced rectal cancer,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Randomized trials demonstrate aerobic training (AT) attenuates treatment-induced impairments in physiological and psychosocial outcomes in a broad number of cancer patient populations. However, whether AT specifically impacts the tolerability of cancer treatment is largely unknown. To address this fundamental knowledge gap in exercise-oncology research, the objective of this study is to evaluate the dose-response of AT on treatment tolerability and related outcomes in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) initiating total neoadjuvant therapy (TNT). LARC is an ideal model in which to conduct a definitive trial of AT on treatment tolerability for several reasons: (1) high rate of LARC diagnoses annually in the U.S. (>40,000), (2) poor tolerability of TNT (<60% of patients complete the recommended regimen), and (3) strong biological rationale (TNT-induced impairment in hematological function is the major cause of poor tolerability, and AT is demonstrated to enhance hematological function in preclinical and clinical studies). Therefore, in this phase 2 randomized trial, a total of 225 inactive (<60 mins of moderate-intensity exercise/wk) patients with LARC scheduled to initiate TNT will be stratified by sex (male vs. females) and age (<55 years vs. >55 years) and randomly allocated (1:1:1 ratio) to receive: 90 mins/week, 150 mins/week, or 300 mins/week from pre-treatment to pre-surgery (~32 weeks). All AT dose regimens will be prescribed according to standard AT principles and implemented using our digital AT platform permitting all sessions to be performed in patients’ homes with remote real-time monitoring. We will address 3 specific aims: AIM 1: Determine dose-response of AT on TNT treatment tolerability. AIM 2: Evaluate AT dose-response on hematological function. AIM 3: Explore AT dose-response on tumor clinical outcomes. The proposed study directly addresses an unmet clinical need by testing, for the first time, the dose-response effects of AT on multiple treatment-related outcomes in patients with LARC receiving TNT. The proposed study will improve behavioral intervention protocols for patients undergoing cancer treatment by using our digital exercise approach that expands access to AT for patients not residing within close proximity of a research site. Receiving cancer treatment is not a qualifying condition for exercise therapy and, as such, exercise is not currently considered a standard aspect of cancer management. Therefore, if successful, findings from this investigation will also shift clinical paradigms regarding exercise therapy in cancer by adding to a growing body of evidence supporting integration of AT into standard clinical cancer care.",2022-05-06T12:05:00Z,2027-04-30T12:04:00Z,RFA-CA-21-031,nofo_RFA-CA-21-031,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,NEW YORK,NY,UNITED STATES,enicto
U01CA271867,"Validation of Biomarkers for predicting Barrett's esophagus that will or will not: i) progress towards cancer, or ii) recur after ablation","Abstract This EDRN-CVC proposal is aimed at the validation of molecular biomarkers for distinguishing high versus low risk esophageal neoplasias (Barrett’s esophagus) for the purpose of guiding selection and management of patients for endoscopic eradication therapy (EET). Two validation studies are proposed: the first, a phase 4 prospective study to identify a patient group at low progression risk who can be spared EET; the second, a phase 3 retrospective study to distinguish individuals who following EET are at low versus high risk of disease recurrence. Barrett’s esophagus (BE) is the precursor lesion of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), a cancer with 80% lethality whose incidence has increased more than 7-fold in the past three decades. BE progresses to EAC in a step-wise fashion from non-dysplastic BE, to low grade dysplasia (LGD), to high grade dysplasia (HGD), and finally cancer. EAC prevention is based on using EET to ablate HGD BE before it can progress to EAC. However, increasingly, EET is also becoming the default therapy for LGD, a highly imprecise diagnosis about which expert pathologists frequently disagree, and which is applied to as many as 40% of BE patients at some point during their course. As EET has a 9% complication rate, the result is an emerging epidemic of overtreatment of BE with LGD. In a prior EDRN-BDL award, our team developed the “BAD” technology for early detection of BE progression. In BAD, we used a brushing device to sample a patient’s full BE esophageal segment. We then analyzed the DNA from this sample using next-generation sequencing technology (developed for liquid biopsy assays) to instead detect presence of BE clones that had acquired gains or losses on specific driver chromosomes associated with EAC. Detection of driver chromosome changes (dubbed Very-BAD), typified EAC and HGD. In contrast, 28% of LGD showed complete absence of any chromosomally aberrant clones (dubbed Not-BAD). We will now validate Not-BAD as a biomarker that identifies LGD at such low progression risk as to not require EET. We will do this by partnering with the SURVENT trial, that will be the first U.S. prospective study to follow LGD patients managed by surveillance, not ablation. A second major challenge with EET is that over 25% of patients recur following ablation (with either high risk BE, HGD, or EAC). These patients face a substantial burden of post-EET surveillance endoscopies, initially at every 3-month intervals. In our prior EDRN-BDL, our team identified a panel of methylated DNA biomarkers for sensitive molecular early detection of BE (currently awarded FDA breakthrough device designation). We have further identified that these markers remain retained in a subset of patients post-EET. We accordingly now propose a retrospective Phase 3 study to further validate these DNA markers for molecular assessment of minimal residual disease, whose post-EET elimination identifies individuals achieving complete molecular eradication of BE, and hence at low risk of disease recurrence and not in need of intense post-EET surveillance. We do this by partnering with the unique UNC-BEECAB biorepository of post-EET esophageal biopsies from patients whose disease did or did not recur following ablation.",2022-09-22T12:09:00Z,2027-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-21-033,nofo_CA-21-033,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,CLEVELAND,OH,UNITED STATES,edrn
U01CA271884,Blood-Based Testing for Advanced Adenoma,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The goal of our Clinical Validation Center (CVC) is to advance and validate blood-based detection of colorectal advanced adenoma. Whereas blood-based testing for invasive colorectal cancer is progressing, with multiple companies pursuing products, the ability of blood-based testing to detect advanced adenomas, the pre- malignant lesions closest to invasive cancer, is uncertain. To optimally impact colorectal cancer incidence, blood-based biomarkers cannot just detect cancer, they should also have sufficient sensitivity to identify subjects with advanced adenomas. For our CVC, we organized and assembled a network of highly skilled clinical centers including a focus on minority populations, to prospectively collect well-characterized, high- quality blood specimens from a large number of subjects with advanced adenoma prior to undergoing polypectomy and serially post-polypectomy. From the same clinical centers, we will collect blood specimens from control subjects. Specimens will be collected and processed using standard protocols, and relevant demographic and clinical variables will be captured to facilitate biomarker validation studies. Specifically, we will use these well-characterized specimens to validate our data on the utility of original, innovative techniques for molecular detection of advanced adenomas including RealSeqS in combination with custom machine learning algorithms such as SignaL. We propose two Specific Aims. In Specific Aim 1, we will conduct a phase 2 case-control study to validate our novel methods for advanced adenoma detection. We will prospectively recruit patients with advanced adenoma (N=400) and site-specific control subjects (N=400) for comparison to the case subjects. In Specific Aim 2, we will utilize serial blood specimens systematically collected post- polypectomy from our case subjects to determine whether our novel molecular detection techniques can be used to predict likelihood of recurrence and potentially guide surveillance colonoscopy exams. Advanced adenomas are the important, next frontier in non-invasive colorectal cancer screening, and our CVC is equipped to profoundly advance blood-based detection of advanced adenoma.",2022-09-12T12:09:00Z,2027-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-21-033,nofo_CA-21-033,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,PITTSBURGH,PA,UNITED STATES,edrn
U01CA271887,Clinical Validation Center for Hepatocellular Carcinoma,"PROJECT SUMMARY Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the fastest-growing cause of cancer death in the U.S. and it is projected to be the 3rd leading cause of cancer death in the U.S. by 2040 given the poor effectiveness of current HCC risk stratification and early detection strategies. Specifically, HCC screening is recommended in all patients with cirrhosis, despite annual HCC risk varying between 1-4%/year, highlighting a need for risk stratification biomarkers. HCC screening is performed using abdominal ultrasound and the serum biomarker alpha fetoprotein (AFP); however, this strategy misses over one-third of HCCs at an early stage and results in screening harms in many patients. The goal of our Clinical Validation Center for HCC (CVC-HCC) is to validate novel blood and imaging biomarkers in phase I-III studies to improve HCC risk stratification and early detection. Translation of HCC biomarkers to practice has been hampered by a dearth of high-quality sample sets including both stored blood and imaging. Existing sample sets also primarily include patients with cirrhosis from active viral hepatitis, with limited applicability to contemporary populations who primarily have cured viral hepatitis or non-viral causes of liver disease. Our CVC will create a contemporary resource with blood and imaging data to allow for rapid validation of promising biomarkers for HCC risk-stratification and early detection in phase I-III studies. A specific population in need of better biomarkers is patients with indeterminate liver nodules (ILNs) on diagnostic CT or MRI, which are observed in over one-fourth of patients undergoing HCC screening and have a high, yet variable, risk for developing into HCC (annual risk ~6-10%/year). Our group has validated a novel blood- based biomarker, PLSec, for risk stratification and a biomarker panel, GALAD, for early HCC detection in patients with cirrhosis and herein propose to perform a phase II-III biomarker study to evaluate them in patients with ILNs. Our team includes national leaders in HCC screening, imaging, and biomarker validation. We are leading efforts to evaluate HCC biomarkers including the EDRN-funded Hepatocellular Early Detection Strategy (HEDS) Study, NCI-funded Translational Liver Cancer (TLC) Consortium, and CPRIT-funded Texas HCC Consortium. We will leverage existing infrastructure across five health systems to create two novel resources not offered by the current sample sets including (1) a biorepository with both blood and imaging data from patients, with and without HCC, representing contemporary etiologies of liver disease for Phase II studies and (2) a prospective cohort of patients with ILNs to evaluate HCC risk stratification and early detection biomarkers in Phase III studies using a prospective-specimen-collection, retrospective-blinded-evaluation (PRoBE) design. We will work with the BCCs and DMCC to evaluate novel biomarkers, facilitating contributions to trans-network projects. Overall, our CVC- HCC will lead to significant advances in phase I-III validation of novel biomarkers for HCC risk stratification and early detection, areas of need that will facilitate development of well-designed phase IV clinical utility trials.",2022-08-03T12:08:00Z,2027-07-31T12:07:00Z,RFA-CA-21-033,nofo_CA-21-033,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,DALLAS,TX,UNITED STATES,edrn
U01CA271888,Clinical Validation Center for Lung Cancer Early Detection,"Abstract The lung cancer early detection CVC has two main goals: Specific Aim 1 is to develop a blood- based biomarker panel for personalized risk assessment, modeled for its cost effectiveness. To this effect, substantial validation work in phase 3 studies has been done using retrospective longitudinal cohorts to test the performance of a four-marker protein panel (4MP) as a means to determine lung cancer risk and need for CT screening. The goal moving forward is to test the 4MP alone and in combinations with other types of markers in the screening setting, using lung cancer screening cohorts available to the CVC. The resulting marker panel, in combination with subject characteristics, would identify subjects who are currently not eligible based on USPSTF criteria that would benefit from CT screening based on their risk, ultimately leading to a utility trial for which a concept has been presented at a recent EDRN scientific meeting. The utility trial concept also includes as an objective to test the value of biomarkers in informing subjects who are currently eligible but not decided to undergo CT screening, about their risk through a decision sharing process. Specific Aim 2 will test the use of biomarkers and AI for interpretation of CT images and to personalize the screening frequency and duration. Sub Aim 1 is intended to validate the macrovasculature surrounding a nodule (vessel number) previously developed as a biomarker, in an independent screening cohort. Sub Aim 2 is intended to develop a validated integrative computational model for improved early lung cancer detection that includes blood- based biomarkers, CT features such as emphysema, presence or absence of a nodule, small airways and subject characteristics for interpretation of CT images and to determine screening frequency. The model will be subjected to a cost effectiveness analysis compared to current lung cancer screening guidelines. The CVC represents a multi-institution, multi-investigator effort with expertise in cancer biomarkers and statistics; pulmonology and lung cancer; epidemiology; radiomics, bioinformatics and artificial intelligence; and clinical trial design, simulation modeling and cost-effectiveness analysis. The CVC brings in substantial accomplishments in biomarker discovery and validation related to lung cancer screening and in CT image analysis.

U01CA272257,Translation of a novel combination therapy approach for non-Hodgkin lymphoma,"Translation of a novel combination therapy approach for non-Hodgkin lymphoma . Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is the most common type of Non-hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) with limited treatment options in the relapsed or refractory (r/r) setting. This is true in humans and dogs. Immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors (CPIs) have demonstrated durable efficacy for Hodgkin’s lymphoma, but poor efficacy for NHL. There is an unmet clinical understand mechanisms of immunotherapy resistance and develop therapeutic approaches to improve clinical response for patients with advanced NHL and other cancers. DLBCL in companion dogs (cDLBCL) is treated with similar chemotherapy protocols and has a similarly poor prognosis in the r/r setting as human DLBCL. While genomic comparison shows limited overlap of the mutational landscape in canine and human DLBCLs, preliminary comparison of the tumor microenvironment (TME) shows conservation of stromal and immune compartments between the two species. Thus, cDLBLCL provide opportunities to prospectively investigate clinical toxicities and mechanisms of clinical response in a clinically realistic setting that recapitulates the pathology, heterogeneity, and TME of human cancers. Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) is a rapidly replicating, robustly immunogenic oncolytic virus (OV) platform that has been engineered for safe systemic therapy of disseminated cancer. Intravenous (IV) VSV therapy was shown preclinically in murine tumor models to rapidly infect, spread within, and kill tumor cells, and induce robust intratumoral immune infiltration, sensitizing tumors to checkpoint blockade. ONIx (oncoimmunology accelerator) is a novel, dual targeted CPI that targets both innate and adaptive mechanisms of tumor immune suppression to enhance antitumor immune responses mediated by macrophages and T-cells. We hypothesize that oncolytic VSV and ONIx will have complementary mechanisms of action (MOA), working in concert to kill tumor cells by direct viral lysis as well as phagocytosis, increase availability of tumor associated antigens (TAAs), promote antigen presentation and activate anti-tumor T-cell responses, to enhance immune mediated tumor killing and improve clinical responses in r/r DLBCL. Our proposal merges the expertise and resources of leading institutions in OV development (Mayo Clinic), comparative oncology (University of Minnesota), and lymphoma immunotherapy (Mayo Lymphoma SPORE) to perform a veterinary trial and correlative studies to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of this novel combination therapy in r/r cDLBCL. The proposed studies will yield valuable insights into how an IV administered OV can infect heterogeneous DLBCL tumors and agitate the TME; if this disruption enhances the ability of CPIs (and potentially other immunotherapies) to activate immune mediated tumor killing; and how the tumor architecture differs in the context of clinical response versus non-response. The heterogeneity inherent in naturally occurring cDLBCL will inform the clinical utility of this combination therapy, define MOA, and identify biomarkers that can be explored clinically in human DLBCL.",2022-09-01T12:09:00Z,2027-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-21-050,nofo_CA21-050,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,ROCHESTER,MN,UNITED STATES,precinct
U01CA272258,Intravesical Immunotherapy of Spontaneous Canine Invasive Urothelial Carcinoma,"PROJECT SUMMARY Invasive bladder cancer is a lethal disease that often requires life-altering surgical removal of the bladder to prevent or limit metastasis. Recent approvals of five checkpoint inhibitors for advanced or refractory bladder cancers demonstrate its responsiveness to immunotherapy. However, less than half of advanced bladder cancer patients benefit from checkpoint immunotherapy and antitumor responses are often transient. Our previous preclinical studies in mice demonstrated that intravesical immunotherapy with interleukin- 12 (IL-12) formulated with the mucoadhesive biopolymer chitosan (CS), i.e., CS/IL-12, can eliminate nearly all established orthotopic bladder tumors in a T cell-dependent manner. These studies also demonstrated that intravesical CS/IL-12 can induce robust abscopal responses with the elimination of distant, untreated bladder tumors in most mice. Although these data are promising, several limitations of implanted murine bladder tumor models have hindered clinical translation. Thus, this application proposes to evaluate the safety and activity of intravesical CS/canine IL-12 (caIL-12) immunotherapy in pet dogs with spontaneous invasive urothelial carcinoma (UC) of the bladder. There are numerous similarities between canine and human bladder cancers including mechanisms of tumorigenesis, rates and sites of metastasis, and distinguishable molecular subtypes. Given these similarities, treatments found to be successful in dogs are more likely to be successful in people. The objectives of this project are: 1) to demonstrate that intravesical CS/caIL-12 immunotherapy can safely induce antitumor immunity against canine invasive UC; and 2) to determine if canine bladder cancer is a useful model for the evaluation of this and other novel immunotherapies. The first objective will help prepare intravesical CS/IL-12 for translation into human clinical trials, while the second objective will help bladder cancer researchers overcome the limitations of rodent models and provide a more faithful representation of human bladder cancer. To accomplish these objectives, 2 specific aims have been designed. Aim 1 is focused on safety, as CS/caIL-12 has never been evaluated in dogs. After synthesizing and validating recombinant caIL-12 in vitro, we will perform a dose-escalation study of intravesical CS/caIL-12 in pet dogs with spontaneous invasive UC of the bladder. Aim 1 will establish a recommended dose (RD) based on safety readouts that utilize a combination of clinical examinations and laboratory tests. Proposed pharmacokinetic and immunophenotyping studies will investigate the possible systemic uptake and dissemination of intravesical immunotherapy and the resulting immune impacts. Aim 2 will assess antitumor and immunological responses to the RD of intravesical CS/caIL-12 in an expanded cohort of dogs with bladder cancer. Correlative studies will determine if intravesical CS/caIL-12 influences T cell infiltration, the tumor- immune microenvironment, neoantigen reactivity and/or T cell clonality. The influence of molecular subtype and tumor mutational burden on antitumor and/or immune responsiveness will be assessed.",2022-09-01T12:09:00Z,2027-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-21-050,nofo_CA21-050,NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIVERSITY RALEIGH,RALEIGH,NC,UNITED STATES,precinct
U01CA272268,Generation of tumor specific immunity in canine osteosarcoma through dendritic cell hyperactivation,"PROJECT SUMMARY Despite substantial improvements in therapeutic strategies, generating robust anti-tumor immune responses in human cancers with a lower somatic mutation burden remains a substantial challenge. Recent data indicate that a critical player in this process, dendritic cells (DCs), fail to effectively elicit efficient and durable T cell responses unless they have entered a unique state of hyperactivation. In this setting, DCs exhibit enhanced migration to local lymph nodes (LNs) and sustained secretion of IL-1β, a cytokine critical for memory T cell formation. In mouse tumor models, vaccination with whole tumor lysate plus an adjuvant consisting of the TLR 7/8 agonist R848 (resiquimod) in combination with a unique isolated lysophosphatidylcholine (22:0 Lyso PC) promotes DC hyperactivation, expansion of antigen specific CD8+ T cells, and robust rejection of tumors. While these findings are encouraging and suggest that identification of specific neoantigens is not necessary to prime and expand a pool of cytotoxic T cells (CTLs), validation and optimization of this approach necessitates the use of a model system that more closely recapitulates human cancers with respect to immune landscape. As such, the purpose of this proposal is to use spontaneous canine cancer, specifically osteosarcoma (OS), as a bridging animal model to validate the utility of DC hyperactivation as a foundational element for generation of robust anti-tumor immunity. The central hypothesis to be tested in this application is that combining hyperactivation of DCs with WTL derived neoantigen will expand a diverse and tumor-specific population of CTLs capable of eliminating residual microscopic metastatic OS tumor cells in dogs following primary tumor removal (amputation). We further predict, that combining DC hyperactivation/WTL with a novel tumor microenvironment (TME) conditioning regimen consisting of toceranib/losartan/ladarixin will enhance the objective response rate in dogs that develop macroscopic lung metastasis. To accomplish this, we will conduct a prospective randomized clinical trial in dogs with OS combining amputation and standard of care carboplatin chemotherapy with adjuvant alone or adjuvant+WTL. Dogs that develop lung metastasis will then be treated with the TME conditioning regimen in combination with adjuvant+WTL. A biobank of tissue samples and blood will be collected from dogs enrolled in these trials including matched primary/metastatic tumors and associated LNs, whole blood, plasma, PBMCs, cell-free DNA, and samples from the vaccine draining LNs. These will be used to perform a set of complementary assays designed to characterize the immune microenvironment and tumor genome over the course of relapse/resistance, credential a novel neoantigen prediction pipeline, and evaluate antigen specific T cell responses. An outstanding team with complementary sets of expertise across clinical trials, translational oncology, comparative genomics, and immuno-oncology has been assembled to ensure stated milestones are achieved. This is bolstered by a dynamic collaboration with our industry partner, Corner Therapeutics, which is committed to supporting this work to facilitate optimization and successful translation into human patients.",2022-09-01T12:09:00Z,2027-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-21-050,nofo_CA21-050,TUFTS UNIVERSITY BOSTON,BOSTON,MA,UNITED STATES,precinct
U01CA272270,Advancing allogeneic CAR-iNKT for the treatment of solid tumors through comparative oncology,"Chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cells have produced unprecedented results in blood cancers, but clinical responses in solid tumors are rare due to the detrimental effects of the hostile, immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) and the use of patient derived, dysfunctional T cells adversely affected by advanced disease state and previous chemotherapy. Invariant Natural Killer T cells (iNKTs) are a distinct lineage of CD1d-restricted T lymphocytes with natural tissue (and tumor) tropism, direct cytolytic effect on CD1d+ cancer cells and tumor associated macrophages and adjuvant effects on endogenous anti-tumor immunity. Unlike conventional T cells, allogeneic iNKTs mediate a robust graft-versus tumor effect without inducing graft-versus-host disease, thus eliminating the need for gene editing to maintain tolerance. Moreover, preclinical studies in mouse models suggest that CAR-enhanced iNKTs can eradicate solid and solid-like hematological tumors where CAR-T cells fail. We hypothesize that allogeneic CAR-engineered iNKTs will overcome the barriers to successful CAR-therapy and provide a powerful off-the-shelf universal platform with curative potential for solid tumors. Yet, unsolved questions related to allo CAR-iNKT safety, optimal preconditioning regimens to promote persistence, cell dose and therapeutic efficacy in solid tumors remain. Furthermore, while healthy human donors for allogeneic iNKT clinical trials are randomly selected, cells generated from different donors have different immunomodulatory capacities that may affect their engraftment and survival and it is currently unknown which products are “best” for adoptive cell therapy (ACT). These questions cannot be adequately addressed in mice due to the dissimilarity between murine and human iNKT cells. In contrast, our preliminary studies demonstrate that canine and human iNKT cells share remarkable phenotypic and functional similarities and can be CAR engineered and expanded to clinical scale for trial use. Here we will use immunocompetent pet dogs with spontaneous osteosarcoma (OSA), which is remarkably similar to pediatric OSA, to advance allogeneic IL-13Rα2-targeting CAR-iNKT cells into the human clinic. We will first characterize CAR-iNKT cells from different donor dogs and generate a master cell bank of canine alloCAR-iNKT products with different immunomodulatory capacities. Next, we will address the safety and effects of 3 strategically designed pre-conditioning regimens, including a combination of cytotoxic chemotherapies, low dose total body irradiation and a clinical grade iNKT glycolipid agonist, RGI-2001, on allo-CAR-iNKT engraftment and persistence in dogs with metastatic OSA. Finally, we will determine the maximum tolerated dose of alloCAR-iNKT cells using an accelerated dose escalation trial design and evaluate their effects on the TME, systemic immunome and disease free interval in dogs with appendicular OSA. This work addresses pivotal questions for the advancement of allogeneic-CAR-iNKT cells in a clinically relevant canine cancer “model” to accelerate clinical use of this promising “off the shelf” approach in human patients with solid tumors.",2022-09-01T12:09:00Z,2027-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-21-050,nofo_CA21-050,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,PHILADELPHIA,PA,UNITED STATES,precinct
U01CA272280,Advancing immunotherapy through cross species studies of immune cell responses and immune checkpoint inhibitor effects in dogs and humans with invasive urinary bladder cancer,"Project Summary / Abstract Invasive urinary bladder cancer (invasive urothelial carcinoma, InvUC) is lethal in 50% of patients. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) can cause dramatic remission of advanced InvUC, but only ~20% of patients have this level of benefit. Pre-clinical animal models are critical for research to improve ICI outcomes, but experimental models lack many of the hallmark features of human cancer and are poor predictors of outcomes in humans. To address the gap in relevant animal cancer models for immunotherapy research, we will study dogs with naturally-occurring InvUC as canine InvUC closely mimics the human condition in pathology, molecular features including luminal and basal subtypes, clinical presentation, local invasion, and frequent metastasis. The proposed work will strengthen the canine InvUC model by defining immune cell responsiveness and ICI outcomes, with comparison to human studies. Our long range goal is to improve the outlook for people with InvUC. The objective of this proposal is to address the gap by determining the suitability of canine InvUC to serve as a model to improve ICI therapy in humans. The central hypothesis is marked similarities will exist between dogs and humans in the immune cell responses in InvUC, and ICI therapy effects including immune adverse events, antitumor activity, immunological responses, and predictors of treatment success and failure. Some differences between dogs and humans are expected, with these also being informative. The hypothesis is formulated and based on strong evidence in the literature and preliminary data. The rationale is that demonstrating the shared immune cell responses and ICI effects between dogs and humans with InvUC will allow the canine model to be fully employed to improve ICI therapy for humans. The objective will be accomplished through two specific aims: (1) determine similarities and differences between dogs and humans in the immune cell responsiveness to InvUC, and (2) determine the safety and antitumor activity of a canine PD-L1 antibody and predictors of success and failure in dogs with InvUC with comparison to findings in humans. The approach will be to: (1) perform dog-human comparison of InvUC through analyses of RNA-seq, scRNA-seq, WGS, and CITE-seq data, and (2) conduct a clinical trial of an ICI, our canine PD-L1 antibody, in dogs with InvUC to assess antitumor activity, pharmacokinetics, adverse event profile, and correlative sequencing and clinical data to predict outcomes, and to compare results to those from human PD- L1 antibody trials. The expected results will define shared immune cell responses and ICI effects in dogs and humans, expand the understanding of predictors of ICI therapy, and justify use of the canine model to improve ICI and other immunotherapies in humans. Samples from dogs in the ICI trial will also be made available for other immune, microRNA, and microbiome research by our collaborators and beyond. We look forward to contributing to the Canine Cancer Immunotherapy Network and depositing our study data in the NCI's Integrated Canine Data Commons, to complement two InvUC data sets that we have previously deposited.",2022-09-01T12:09:00Z,2027-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-21-050,nofo_CA21-050,PURDUE UNIVERSITY,WEST LAFAYETTE,IN,UNITED STATES,precinct
U01CA272424,Determine the molecular and metabolic mechanisms by which A-FABP links  dysregulated lipid metabolism-induced obesity/breast cancer risk,"The objective of this proposal is to determine how high fat diet (HFD)-induced lipid dysregulation links obesity with increased breast cancer (BC) risk. Epidemiologic studies have confirmed that obesity increases the risk and mortality of BC, but the molecular mechanisms of obesity/breast cancer associations remain largely unknown. Our recent studies demonstrate that lipid chaperone A-FABP (adipose fatty acid binding protein, also known as FABP4) promotes obesity-associated BC by intracellular regulating pro-tumor activity in tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) and extracellular enhancing aggressive phenotype of BC cells. Thus, A- FABP might represent a new factor linking dysregulated lipid metabolism with obesity/BC risk. Moreover, we observed that obesity can be induced by consumption of different types of HFDs, including saturated fats (e.g. cocoa butter) or unsaturated fats (e.g. olive oil, fish oil). However, only cocoa butter HFD-induced obesity was associated with increased A-FABP expression and mammary tumor growth. These observations suggest a novel concept that not all HFD-induced obesity is tumorigenic. Given the undefined links underlying obesity- induced BC risk, we hypothesized that HFDs rich in saturated fats promote BC risk through A-FABP-mediated immune and metabolic regulations. As such, A-FABP offers a novel therapeutic target and biomarker for obesity-associated BC risk. Three complementary but independent specific aims are designed to address our central hypothesis. Aim 1 is to determine the molecular mechanisms by which different HFDs upregulate A- FABP for BC risk. We will identify which HFDs promote mammary tumor risk and further dissect how the “bad” fat drives intracellular A-FABP expression in TAMs and promotes extracellular A-FABP secretion from adipocytes. Aim 2 is to delineate the downstream metabolic mechanisms of HFD-upregulated A-FABP in BC risk and immunotherapy. We will delineate how intracellular A-FABP in TAMs regulates the FA oxidation (FAO)/HIF2α/PD-L1 pathway for immune suppressive function, followed by delineation of how extracellular A- FABP reprograms lipid metabolic profile in BC cells to enhance their aggressive phenotype. We will further evaluate if blocking A-FABP activity with our unique humanized antibodies improves A-FABP-induced metabolic dysregulation and reduces obesity/BC risk. Aim 3 is to evaluate A-FABP as a biomarker for obesity- associated BC in humans. We will determine the function of A-FABP in peripheral monocytes and measure the levels of soluble A-FABP in serum and A-FABP expression in tumor stroma using specimens collected from lean and obese women with or without BC. Successful completion of this proposal will determine the “bad HFDs” in promoting BC risk and identify the molecular and metabolic mechanisms by which A-FABP mediates the pro-tumorigenic activities in HFD-induced obesity/BC risk.",2022-08-12T12:08:00Z,2027-07-31T12:07:00Z,RFA-CA-21-021,nofo_CA21-021,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,IOWA CITY,IA,UNITED STATES,metabolic_dysregulation_and_cancer_risk_program
U01CA272452,Decoding mechanisms underlying metabolic dysregulation in obesity and digestive cancer risk,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Obesity is associated with increased risk of at least 13 cancers. Of all cancers attributable to excess adiposity, colorectum and liver account for 55% of cancer among men and 48% among women, excluding reproductive cancers. Although most epidemiologic studies of obesity as a cancer risk factor evaluated body mass index (BMI), accumulating evidence for colorectal and liver cancers implicates viscerally located adiposity (and its closely related glycemic metabolic dysregulation) as the likely direct causal component. How visceral adiposity mechanistically predisposes its proximal organs to cancer is largely unknown. Inflammation undoubtedly plays a role in development and progression of malignancies, including colorectal and liver cancers; however, the large body of evidence for general inflammation processes and systemic markers like C-reactive protein (CRP) in relation to digestive cancers are underwhelming, possibly because most are non-specific to high-risk metabolically unhealthy obesity per se. Thus, distilling the inflammatory pathways and markers to identify those most reflective of the metabolically unhealthy obese state has immense potential to uncover key mechanisms and inform powerful broad-spectrum strategies for prevention. Techniques to obtain precise measures to characterize metabolically unhealthy obesity are often prohibitively costly and logistically infeasible in the context of large population-based studies. Therefore, we propose an innovative approach to address these gaps by (i) deriving novel proteomic-based inflammation signatures of metabolically unhealthy obesity (“Inflammotypes”) in cohorts with visceral adipose tissue quantified via dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and traits of glycemic metabolic function; then (ii) prospectively investigating these novel Inflammotypes in longitudinal cohorts with stored blood samples in relation to incident colorectal and liver cancer risk. We will characterize Inflammotypes via state-of-the-art Olink proteomic panel (384 inflammation-related proteins) to describe metabolically unhealthy obesity (i.e., higher visceral adiposity, with homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance [HOMA-IR], hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c], or lipoprotein insulin resistance score [LPIR]). Machine learning analyses to identify the Inflammotypes will be replicated in an external cohort. We will then investigate the relationship between proteomic Inflammotypes with long-term risk of incident colorectal (1000 cases/1000 controls) and liver cancer (500 cases/500 controls), combining longitudinal cohorts with stored baseline bloods and long-term follow-up (median ranges 6.1-16.7 years). Based on compelling preliminary data, we hypothesize the combination of greater visceral adipose tissue and glycemic metabolic dysregulation are associated with abnormal profiles of circulating proteins, and that these novel Inflammotypes are independently predictive of long-term colorectal and liver cancer risks. These aims are closely aligned with the goals of the Metabolic Dysregulation and Cancer Risk Program, including enhancing identification of high-risk individuals, risk prediction, and elucidation of potential preventive and therapeutic targets.",2022-09-20T12:09:00Z,2027-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-21-021,nofo_CA21-021,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,BOSTON,MA,UNITED STATES,metabolic_dysregulation_and_cancer_risk_program
U01CA272529,Ceramides as novel drivers of metabolic dysfunction and colorectal cancer,"SUMMARY In response to the burgeoning worldwide obesity pandemic, the rate of obesity-associated colorectal cancer (CRC) remains an enormous public health burden. The metabolic determinants of CRC are complex and remain under debate. Ceramides are pathogenic lipids that signal a state of nutrition excess and accumulate in organs that are not suited for fat storage, driving insulin resistance and dyslipidemia. Our preliminary data also demonstrate that ceramides are critical intermediates linking nutritional inputs like fatty acids to intestinal stem cell proliferation. Our long-term goal is to understand the role of ceramide metabolism in the development of CRC and to identify pharmacologic and dietary strategies to intervene upon ceramide metabolism for cancer prevention. Our central hypothesis is that ceramide metabolism is a key component of metabolic dysregulation underlying CRC. We propose a transdisciplinary collaboration, utilizing epidemiologic and clinical cohorts and animal experiments, to conduct synergistic analyses and interventions to address our hypothesis. In Aim 1a, using a rigorous discovery-replication design, we will characterize a ceramide-based CRC risk score in serum from participants in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) (n=1260cases/1260 controls), and the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) cancer cohort (n=1234 cases/1234 controls), and identify a dietary pattern strongly linked to ceramides. In Aim 1b, we will determine the effects of medical and surgical weight loss and changes in body composition on the ceramide CRC risk score in our ongoing Utah Bariatric Surgery Cohort. In Aim 1c, we will measure the association of genetically predicted levels of circulating ceramides with risk of CRC using data from 57,873 CRC cases and 67,087 controls in the Genetics and Epidemiology of CRC Consortium (GECCO), and test for gene by dietary pattern interaction. In Aim 2, we will determine whether systemic or tissue-specific reduction of ceramides affects CRC development. We will impede ceramide synthesis by inhibiting dihydroceramide desaturase-1 (DES1) action genetically (Aim 2a) and pharmacologically (Aim 2b), and via a serine or time restricted dietary pattern (Aim 2c), to test for effects on gut, liver and adipose depots and colorectal tumor incidence in an azoxymethane mouse model of CRC. The study leverages a new class of DES1 inhibitors that lower tissue ceramides and ameliorate the pathogenic consequences of obesity. The proposed study fills a major gap in evidence for understanding how ceramides contribute to the metabolic dysregulation underlying CRC. We propose a fully translational approach integrating epidemiologic associations between ceramides and colorectal malignancies and preclinical studies testing the utility of ceramide-lowering interventions on cancer endpoints. Findings will have important implications for understanding the biologic mechanisms underpinning obesity-associated metabolic dysregulation in CRC and for identifying new targets for CRC prevention.",2022-09-02T12:09:00Z,2027-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-21-021,nofo_CA21-021,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,SALT LAKE CITY,UT,UNITED STATES,metabolic_dysregulation_and_cancer_risk_program
U01CA272541,Determining the contribution of microbial-derived metabolites to protective immunity in obesity-driven cancer risk.,"SUMMARY: Obesity is associated with increased risk for 13 cancers. Critical questions are how and to what extent underlying mechanisms of obesity-mediated increases in chronic inflammation may increase cancer risk in a failure of “protective immunity”. This knowledge gap represents an untapped opportunity that our multidis- ciplinary team is uniquely qualified to explore with a mission to improve understanding of cancer risk. We have previously shown obesity alters T cell and macrophage functions that could decrease anti-tumor protections and have expertise in human studies essential for this interdisciplinary challenge. Our objective is to identify associations in human subjects and test mechanisms of mediators of cancer risk in various pre-clinical models along an “obesitymicrobes metabolites protective immunity” axis. Our hypothesis is that obesity-altered gut microbes enhance cancer risk through dysregulated protective immunity that allows increased initiation. Aim 1 will define obesity-mediated dysregulation of microbial-derived metabolites and impacts on immune phe- notypes and protective immunity in human subjects at greater risk for cancer by examining diverse subjects 1a) of varied age and adiposity; and 1b) obese patients pre- and post- bariatric surgery. Donors will be drawn from the Memphis area, which offers a highly diverse population with 65% African Americans with a high inci- dence of obesity. Patient analyses will inform studies in complementary pre-clinical models to allow for mecha- nistic investigation to identify conserved mechanisms in the pre-cancer microenvironment. Aim 2 will deter- mine the impact of microbially-derived metabolites on cancer risk by examining immune cells in spontaneous transgenic models of breast cancer with established heterogeneity in latency, obesogenic response to high fat diet, circulating bile acids, and gut microbes. Aim 3 will test dietary administration of a specific microbially-de- rived metabolite or microbe on protective immunity in complementary carcinogenic and syngeneic models of obesity-mediated breast cancer, respectively. Human subject and murine model studies complemented by ex vivo and in vitro studies will test underlying mechanisms to determine how microbially-modified metabolites may impact immune-cancer cell crosstalk. Collaborative funds for cross-consortium activities are reserved for risk assessment across heterogenous lean and obese populations and models across aims to add synergistic impact to our findings through NCI’s Metabolic Dysregulation and Cancer Risk Program. In sum, outcomes will define beneficial microbially-derived metabolites that impact protective immunity to reduce cancer initiation. Thus, the strategy of this proposal is conceptually original, innovative, and significant to define conserved un- derlying mechanisms that suppress cancer risk. Findings generated will have high impact because the obesity- associated etiological impacts on risk will be heterogeneous and this study is designed to investigate those varied mechanisms to translate to better risk management to improve patient outcomes.",2022-09-01T12:09:00Z,2027-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-21-021,nofo_CA21-021,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE HEALTH SCI CTR,MEMPHIS,TN,UNITED STATES,metabolic_dysregulation_and_cancer_risk_program
U01CA272546,Bay Area Cancer Target Discovery and Development,"PROJECT SUMMARY Our general strategy is to take advantage of novel tools and methodologies that we have developed during our first two CTD^2 funding periods– more specifically pioneering and applying CRISPR based technologies to aid the discovery and characterization of novel cancer targets and their modulators– using innovative high throughput technologies. Our end goal is to uncover optimal combinations of targets with the potential to eliminate all cancer cells, despite their clonal heterogeneity and environmental context. This requires us to better understand tumor biogenesis, namely the combinations of genes that drive oncogenesis, and tumor heterogeneity which complicates effective therapeutic treatment. In this proposal we build upon exciting systems allowing us to quantitate genotypic and phenotypic cell heterogeneity in cell culture and in vivo. The overall goal is to identify synthetic gene combinations necessary for clinical resistance and related to inter- and intra-tumor heterogeneity. We hypothesize that altered cell states such as inflammatory phenotypes and lineage plasticity fuels therapy tolerance and resistance. We apply single-cell approaches and cutting-edge lineage tracing tools to investigate the genesis of pathogenic cellular state changes and use genetic screening, computational and pharmacologic approaches, and clinically relevant in vitro and in vivo tumor models to identify mechanistically calibrated, specific therapeutic vulnerabilities. These approaches will be applied to two cancer, lung and breast adenocarcinoma. Tumor biogenesis and evolution is a challenging area of research, largely due to the complexity of cell types and behaviors and the combinations of genes that drive cancer types and subtypes is poorly understood. We have developed next generation GEMMs to interrogate gene combinations that promote cancer. In this aim, mouse models will be generated that contain combinations of genetic perturbations of the top 30 TCGA recurrent mutations. These studies will associate the combination of perturbagens with specific cell states, despite their clonal heterogeneity and cell state and lay a solid foundation for identifying which combinations of recurrent genes respond to which therapy, thus helping to stratify patients. This part of the research program focuses on lung cancer as it synergizes with other components of the proposal. We apply an evolved lineage tracing technology with single cell RNA-seq readout that lets us follow tumor evolution with unprecedented resolution. These studies will help us understand how tumor plasticity enables cancers to evade therapeutic challenges. And importantly, how the loss of tumor suppressor genes or gene combinations, alters the preferred evolutionary paths a single transformed cell takes to reach aggressive and metastatic states.",2022-09-13T12:09:00Z,2027-08-31T12:08:00Z,PAR-21-274,nofo_PAR-21-274,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",SAN FRANCISCO,CA,UNITED STATES,ctd_2
U01CA272610,Elucidating and Targeting tumor dependencies and drug resistance determinants at the single cell level,"Cancer targets fall into two major categories: oncoproteins that elicit tumor essentiality due to their direct role in tumorigenesis or tumor maintenance (oncogene dependencies) and proteins that elicit synthetic lethality with oncogene mutations but are not themselves mutated (non-oncogene dependencies). Unfortunately, clonal selection and inherent cancer cell plasticity—as well as the ability of cancer cells to undergo adaptation and reprogramming to drug resistant states, following treatment—are currently challenging the concept of individual proteins as effective therapeutic targets for an entire tumor mass—especially if identified from bulk tissue analyses. Indeed, despite several successes, only 5% – 11% of cancer patients benefit from targeted therapy, based on progression free survival, often with no substantial overall survival differences; while promising, immune therapy is also subject to selective response and relapse. To address these challenges, our proposal will study a more universal class of mutation-agnostic, non-oncogene dependencies implemented by tightly-autoregulated sets of Master Regulator (MR) proteins that we have called Tumor Checkpoint (TC) modules. We have shown that MR proteins mechanistically implement a tumor cell’s transcriptional state by canalizing the effect of mutations and aberrant signals in their upstream pathways. As such, within the context of a transcriptionally-distinct tumor subtype, they represent largely mutation-agnostic dependencies. Our proposal will thus focus on the elucidation and pharmacological targeting of MRs and TC-modules at the single cell level, within molecularly distinct, yet co-existing tumor subpopulations. This will lead to design of successful combination therapy approaches and will help elucidate and pharmacologically target mechanisms of drug resistance and cell adaptation. To accomplish these goals, we will extend a highly successful, network- based framework developed by our CTD2 Center, for the elucidation, validation, and pharmacological targeting of MR proteins and TC-modules. Indeed, we have shown that genetic or pharmacological targeting of this new class of tumor dependencies can induce collapse of TC-module activity and induce loss of tumor viability in a wide range of malignancies, ranging from glioblastoma, neuroblastoma, and neuroendocrine tumors, to prostate and breast adenocarcinoma, among many others. In particular, analysis of 25 TCGA cohorts has identified 112 transcriptionally distinct tumor subtypes, each one regulated by a distinct subtype-specific TC-module, which was independent of patient-specific mutations. These methodologies are especially relevant in rare, aggressive tumors—including several pediatric malignancies—where cohort size may be too small to support correlative analyses. Critically, these studies have led to the development of two NY/CA Dpt. of Health approved, CLIA- compliant tests, OncoTarget and OncoTreat, whose predictions have spurred several clinical trials. These approaches will be extended to elucidate TC-module dependencies and to develop drug sensitivity biomarkers at the single cell level.",2022-09-21T12:09:00Z,2027-08-31T12:08:00Z,PAR-21-274,nofo_PAR-21-274,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,NEW YORK,NY,UNITED STATES,ctd_2
U01CA272612,Translating novel cancer targets and mechanisms from the CTD^2 Network using molecular glues,"PROJECT SUMMARY Our current CTD2 Network Center discovered that many cancers, following drug treatment, emerge in a stable cell state resistant to apoptosis and vulnerable to ferroptosis. While pursuing efforts to translate these findings, and the findings of other discoveries throughout the Network, we recognized a central need for the CTD2 Network to adapt new methods of drug discovery. Here, we describe computational and experimental advances in the discovery of small-molecule binders and molecular glues emerging from the novel use of synthetic organic chemistry, DNA barcoding, computational analyses of enriched barcodes following affinity-based screens, and chemical biology assays. We base our strategy on the discovery that small-molecule glues can bring together two proteins that do not otherwise associate. We will exploit DNA-barcoded compounds to discover drug-like molecular glues that are: 1) degradation-selective, 2) tissue-selective, and 3) oncogene-selective. This proposal aims to develop novel methods to translate CTD2 Network discoveries of difficult-to-drug cancer vulnerabilities towards novel therapeutics. The methods yield molecular glues that confer activities not available by current drug-discovery methods, and to develop a blueprint to discover systematically degraders for cancer vulnerabilities, tissue-restricted enzyme inhibitors, and compounds that restore protein–protein associations impaired by oncogenic mutation. In Aim 1, we will develop novel capabilities to identify specific presenter proteins and to discover molecular glues. In Aim 2, we will discover novel molecular glues using DNA-barcoding technology.

These compounds will serve as launching pads to inform cancer vulnerabilities and, upon chemical optimization, therapeutic hypotheses in specific cancer types.

U01CA272977,A Transdisciplinary Approach to Investigating Metabolic Dysregulation in Obese Parent and Child Dyads and Risk of Colorectal Cancer,"This U01 project leverages our expertise in the epidemiology of colorectal cancer (CRC); disparities; obesity; metabolic dysregulation, an important manifestation of inflammation; the microbiome; animal CRC models; and lifestyle intervention trials to address the growing problem of Early-Onset CRC (EOCRC) (i.e., <50 years). Adiposity and diet drive metabolic dysregulation. So, understanding the interaction between diet and adiposity are key to understanding the genesis of EOCRC – and an array of other obesity-related cancers). This project will address the absence of critical clinical trials and mechanistic studies involving lifestyle interventions for EOCRC. We intend to address this gap; and have the transdisciplinary team representing complementary backgrounds to do so. We focus on dietary modulation of gut microbes to reduce metaflammation and subsequent metabolic dysfunction in obesity, with a goal of preventing EOCRC. We will perform 1) an anti- inflammatory dietary intervention trial in dyads of adults and children at elevated risk for CRC. We also will conduct a complementary mechanistic animal study that builds on and leverages our expertise in mechanistic studies on obesity and CRC. This work is supported by infrastructure that we have built over the past decades in two key centers at the University of South Carolina (UofSC): (1) Center for Colon Cancer Research (CCCR, 2002 - present – which specializes in mouse models of CRC); and (2) the Cancer Prevention and Control Program (CPCP, 2000 - present – which specializes in the epidemiology of cancer and lifestyle intervention trials for cancer, with a focus on cancer disparities. The two projects that comprise the proposed grant address two Specific Aims that are represented by the human study and laboratory animal experiment: i.e. ,1: To establish the metabolic protective effects of an anti-inflammatory diet in obese, high-risk African- American (AA) and European-American (EA) adults and children in reducing inflammation as indicated by Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR), IGF-1, Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNFα), Interleukin 6 (IL-6), and C-Reactive Protein (CRP), and a creating more favorable microbiome signature; 2: To establish gut microbes as mediators between anti-inflammatory dietary input and reversal of metabolic dysfunction and associated CRC risk. This complements the human study by carrying out pre-clinical murine model studies with similar inputs (diet), intermediate endpoints (inflammation, microbiome), and outcomes (CRC-related). We hypothesize that an anti-inflammatory dietary intervention will reduce metabolic dysfunction and metainflammation through regulatory effects on gut microbiota. Results from this work will address the role of metabolic dysregulation in relation to factors that are known to be important in carcinogenesis, that therefore could have profound effects on EOCRC, have implications for other obesity-related cancers, and have great promise for moving the field forward by addressing mechanisms that drive large health-related disparities that consistently disfavor African Americans.",2022-08-16T12:08:00Z,2027-07-31T12:07:00Z,RFA-CA-21-021,nofo_CA21-021,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,COLUMBIA,SC,UNITED STATES,metabolic_dysregulation_and_cancer_risk_program
U01CA274154,Fibroblast orchestration of the immune response in pancreatic cancer,"Pancreatic cancer is a deadly malignancy, direly in need of new therapeutic approaches. Pancreatic cancer is characterized by extensive accumulation of a fibroinflammatory stroma, containing abundant fibroblasts. Long believed to be a uniform cell population, fibroblasts have emerged as a heterogeneous and functionally important component of the tumor. Yet, the literature on fibroblasts in pancreatic cancer is controversial, with studies supporting both a pro- and an anti-tumor role. Our preliminary data show that oncogenic KRAS, a hallmark mutation of pancreatic cancer, expressed in tumor cells extrinsically reprograms the transcriptional program of fibroblasts. Further, continuous expression of epithelial oncogenic Kras is required to maintain expression of a panel of inflammatory cytokines in fibroblasts. Unlike mouse tumors, human pancreatic cancer is highly heterogeneous in terms of genetic alterations and histological characteristics of cancer cells. How fibroblasts are reprogrammed in the context of different types of human pancreatic cancer and how they contribute to carcinogenesis is unclear. Lastly, most in depth studies on pancreatic cancer are based on largely White patient populations, while the disease is equally prevalent in all race groups. The University of Michigan/Henry Ford Health System team together has access to a large patient volume, diverse patient populations (with 30% HFHS patients being African American), and the skillset to characterize and functionally assess fibroblasts on pancreatic cancer. We will map fibroblast heterogeneity across tumors in a diverse patient population. We will evaluate whether fibroblast heterogeneity correlates with different subtypes of tumor cells (classified as classical and mesenchymal). We will further take advantage of the genetically engineered mouse models available in our group to target fibroblast reprogramming at different stages of carcinogenesis. Overall, our work will shed light on the regulation and function of pancreatic CAFs and open the way for new therapeutic approaches targeting this population.",2022-09-19T12:09:00Z,2027-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-21-041,nofo_RFA-CA-21-041,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,ANN ARBOR,MI,UNITED STATES,psrc
U01CA274276,Stromal modulation of pancreatic cancer malignant cell state and therapeutic sensitivity,"Abstract Unlike many cancers, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is characterized by a hypoxic, nutrient- deprived, immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) and a fibrotic stroma that may impair treatment response. Recent single-cell studies suggest a complex interplay between malignant tumor cells and other cell types within the TME, with crosstalk between tumor and stromal cell types influencing malignant cell phenotypes, including responses to therapy. Understanding these interactions will provide insight into PDAC progression and therapy resistance. In particular, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are a major non-immune cell component of the TME and are comprised of several distinct subtypes that vary based on tumor subtype and the surrounding microenvironmental niche. In this proposal, we bring together a multidisciplinary team of basic and translational investigators that will build upon our prior studies to investigate the Tumor-TME co-organizer model with a focus on interrogating interactions between PDAC tumor cells and CAFs in the TME. Specifically, we will examine the overarching hypothesis that reciprocal signaling between tumor cells and CAFs shapes malignant cell and CAF phenotypes in a context-specific manner that can be modulated by prior therapy and the organ-specific niche. We will leverage multiple built-in capabilities, including genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs), patient- derived organoid (PDO) and matched fibroblast models, functional genetic screens and clinical trials with serial biopsies to study the PDAC TME continuum in disease progression and resistance to therapy. Specifically, we propose (1) to determine whether targeting organ-specific PDAC-CAF interactions enhances therapeutic responses, (2) to interrogate novel vulnerabilities resulting from tumor cell and CAF reprogramming during PDAC therapy, and (3) investigate whether TGFB blockade disrupts tumor cell-CAF crosstalk and sensitizes PDAC to chemotherapy. In pursuing these studies, we will work with other members of the PDAC Stromal Reprogramming Consortium (PSRC) to pursue collaborative studies to understand how PDAC and TME interactions program tumor progression and therapy responses.",2022-09-19T12:09:00Z,2027-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-21-041,nofo_RFA-CA-21-041,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,BOSTON,MA,UNITED STATES,psrc
U01CA274295,Regulation of PDAC metabolism and immunity by collagen and its cleavage products,"ABSTRACT Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly desmoplastic and therapy-resistant cancer. The role of the desmoplastic stroma in PDAC remains elusive with studies supporting both tumor-promoting or tumor- restricting functions. The failure of stroma targeting therapies suggests that a deeper understanding of the complex cancer-stroma interaction is needed. Type I collagen (Col I), the major ECM protein in PDAC, can physically restrain tumors and limit nutrient availability. Yet, PDAC cells adapt and exploit the surrounding stroma to acquire more advanced malignant traits. Moreover, the desmoplastic collagen-rich stroma may suppress immunosurveillance and activate tumor-promoting mechanosensitive signaling. It is likely that tumor-promoting and tumor-suppressive effects of CAF and ECM occur in parallel and that their balance determines the net effect on PDAC growth. We seek to better understand these opposing functions by focusing on Col I as a key mediator of stroma-PDAC crosstalk. Clinical studies show improved progression-free survival (PFS) after resection in patients with “inert stroma” characterized by extensive ECM deposition and low fibrolytic activity, whereas highly fibrolytic stroma is associated with much shorter PFS times. Based on this finding we hypothesize that rather than the sheer quantity of CAF and stroma, collagen fibrolysis and differential effects of receptors that discriminate between intact and cleaved Col I dictate tumor growth and immunity. Our preliminary data support this hypothesis, indicating differential regulation of cancer cell metabolism by intact and cleaved collagen through a specific receptor, DDR1; as well as high expression of the inhibitory Col I receptor LAIR1 on immune cells and a role for Col I in immune cell infiltration and activation in PDAC spread to the liver, the most common site of metastasis and a suppressor of systemic anti-tumor immunity. Our long-term goal is to develop therapies that target collagen receptors and shift the balance from immunosuppression and tumor promotion by cleaved collagen to tumor starvation, growth inhibition and enhanced anti-tumor immunity, rather than CAF depletion or modulation, which so far had resulted in untoward effects. Our interdisciplinary team of basic and clinical- translational investigators will utilize clinical specimens, tumor slice cultures, single cell RNA-sequencing, spatial transcriptomics, mouse models and PDAC-ECM co-cultures to elucidate the role of collagen receptor signaling via two closely integrated specific aims: 1. Test the hypothesis that collagen fragments and fibers antagonistically control PDAC metabolism through the PDAC-intrinsic collagen receptor DDR1, whose inhibition can switch off tumor metabolism and induce cell death. 2. Test the hypothesis that stimulatory and inhibitory collagen receptors control anti-PDAC immunity and can be combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors to increase anti-tumor immunity. The successful completion of these research goals will provide us with novel tools for converting stroma-mediated tumor growth and immunosuppression to growth inhibition and anti-tumor immunity.",2022-09-21T12:09:00Z,2027-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-21-041,nofo_RFA-CA-21-041,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",LA JOLLA,CA,UNITED STATES,psrc
U01CA274298,Integrating tumor and stroma to understand and predict treatment response,"ABSTRACT Through novel deconvolution approaches for bulk RNA sequencing analysis, we identified two tumor-intrinsic subtypes of PDAC (basal and classical) that we have confirmed, are robust, replicable, prognostic and predictive of treatment response. We found that the basal subtype is consistently associated with poor outcome and have shown, through analysis of two clinical trials, that patients with basal subtype tumors do not respond to the 1st-line therapy FOLFIRINOX. These results strongly support the idea that molecular subtypes may be used to select treatment. Given the impact of our tumor-intrinsic subtypes on therapy response, we developed a single sample classifier, PurIST, that is now a CLIA certified assay and being evaluated as an integral marker for treatment selection in a clinical trial. In parallel, we developed a de novo approach, DECODER to deconvolve bulk tumors into compartments that allows us to determine tumor and TME specific characteristics in patients. Using the deconvolution approaches that led us to identify tumor-intrinsic subtypes, we have found two types of PDAC stroma: activated, and normal where patients with activated stroma have shorter survival. We have shown that CAFs are the contributory cells in activated stroma. Patients can be found to have a combination of tumor/stroma subtypes and the combinations have different impacts on outcome, suggesting that it is critically important to understand tumor-stroma interactions and how they affect treatment response. Similarly, we find that i/myCAF may differentially educate basal vs. classical subtype lines Our findings provide strong support for our central hypothesis that CAFs and tumor cells have interactions that together may alter tumor progression and response, making it critical that we understand the heterogeneity of the stroma, and specifically CAFs, their interaction with the tumor, for tumor-stroma context specific treatment response. Our team is uniquely positioned to comprehensively characterize CAF/NAF-tumor heterogeneity and interactions, response to treatment, and develop an integrative CAF-tumor subtype classifier to predict treatment response of patients in standard of care, stroma and immune modulating trials.",2022-09-01T12:09:00Z,2027-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-21-041,nofo_RFA-CA-21-041,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,CHAPEL HILL,NC,UNITED STATES,psrc
U01CA274304,Reprogramming PDAC Stroma by Targeting Coagulation in the Tumor Microenvironment,"PROJECT SUMMARY The overarching goal of this research program is to identify therapeutic strategies to convert the stroma of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) to a chemo- and immune-sensitive tumor microenvironment (TME). PDAC is characterized by a desmoplastic stroma that facilitates tumor growth/invasion, chemoresistance of pancreatic cancer cells (PCC), and immunosuppressive TME. Highly packed cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and dense extracellular matrix (ECM) are hallmarks of the PDAC stroma and constitute physical drug delivery barriers. Several stromal components have been targeted to enhance drug delivery, but recent studies have suggested anti-tumor roles for the stroma as complete ablation of stromal components leads to more aggressive tumors. New strategies are highly desired to reprogram stroma without compromising its anti-tumor roles. The central hypothesis is that the coagulation system in the PDAC TME can be targeted to reprogram PDAC stroma to overcome chemoresistance, drug delivery barriers, and immunosuppressive TME. Cancer- associated coagulation has been reported as a key functional signaling pathway in PDAC. Notably, several coagulation molecular targets, including thrombin, protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1), and fibrinogen/fibrin, have been implicated in important roles contributing to tumor progression and therapeutic resistance. Specifically, it is hypothesized that the thrombin-PAR1 signaling axis can be targeted to suppress PCC growth/invasion and CAF growth/fibrosis. In addition, thrombin-mediated fibrin deposition can be targeted to suppress the drug delivery barrier and immunosuppressive TAM activities, which suppresses anti-tumor T cell activities. This hypothesis will be tested mechanistically and evaluated for translational potential by pursuing the following two integrated aims: Aim 1) Mechanistic Research: Determine the contribution of the coagulation targets in the PDAC TME. Specifically, the team will determine the role of thrombin-PAR1 signaling axis to CAF-mediated fibrosis, thrombin-mediated fibrin deposition on drug resistance, and PAR1/fibrin on the immunosuppressive TME. Aim 2) Translational Research: Evaluate the pharmacological inhibition of the coagulation targets. Especially, the team will expand the mechanistic understanding from Aim 1 using patient- derived PDAC models with FDA-approved inhibitors of thrombin and PAR1, and fibrinogen depleting agents. The effects of pharmacological inhibition will feedback to Aim 1 to delineate the efficacy of inhibiting coagulation targets. The outcome of this research will establish a new mechanistic understanding of the role of coagulation activities in the PDAC TME. It will determine whether blockade of the coagulation is a promising strategy to reprogram the PDAC stroma and, ultimately, suppress PCC/CAF growth and improve drug delivery and efficacy.",2022-09-01T12:09:00Z,2027-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-21-041,nofo_RFA-CA-21-041,PURDUE UNIVERSITY,WEST LAFAYETTE,IN,UNITED STATES,psrc
U01CA274312,Elucidation and targeting of paracrine cascades in PDAC,"Abstract Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is among the most lethal malignancies due largely to their lack of response to current cytotoxic, targeted, and immune therapies. PDAC tumor tissues harbor an expansive, desmoplastic stroma that both suppresses angiogenesis and limits perfusion and diffusion. Consequently, delivery of therapeutic agents through systemic administration is impeded, lowering drug efficacy and increasing general toxicity. Indeed, multiple components of the PDAC stroma support its survival and growth, for example by conditioning a locally immunosuppressed microenvironment that facilitates tumor survival. Conversely, we previously showed that at least some elements of the tumor stromal restrain PDAC growth and progression, for example Hedgehog pathway-responsive myofibroblasts. Early attempts to modulate the PDAC stroma in order to facilitate drug delivery failed upon clinical translation. Post-clinical trials ultimately demonstrated that stromal remodulation upon inhibition of individual pathways can lead to unpredictable consequences in multiple additional cell types. Based on these data, we hypothesize that individual paracrine pathways typically link together to form “paracrine cascades” that propagate through multiple pathways and cell types. We advance that reconstructing these paracrine cascades offers both the opportunity to better understand the consequences of therapeutic intervention and also to infer candidate targets that act on a broad range of cell types within the PDAC TME to enact stromal remodulation. In order to test this, we will make use of a series of innovative systems biology tools built by members of our transdisciplinary team. These include a suite of algorithms leveraging the computational field of regulatory network analysis, as well as technically innovative techniques for studying outcomes in single cell datasets. Moreover, we will acquire unique dataset from samples collected by members of our multidisciplinary clinical service at the Pancreas Center of New York Presbyterian Hospital. These include acquiring human PDAC tumor interstitial fluid and generating matched sets of tumor, normal pancreas, spleen, and blood samples from PDAC patients. We will also routinely utilize fresh PDAC tissue samples to make tumor “explants” a novel ex vivo model system for the short-term, medium throughput study of PDAC. This new model system enables the dissection of complex multi-cellular phenotypes in ways that are not possible through study of intact tumors or co-cultures of purified cell types Using these approaches, we will reconstruct the network of paracrine cascades in PDAC and validate selected candidates experimentally. We will also test a specific candidate pathway uncovered through study of the Hh pathway that connects myofibroblasts to myeloid derived suppressor cells and cytotoxic lymphocytes. We expect that the proposed studies will provide an expansive understanding of paracrine crosstalk in PDAC and also provide multiple valuable resources and techniques to the PSRC consortium.",2022-09-01T12:09:00Z,2027-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-21-041,nofo_RFA-CA-21-041,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,NEW YORK,NY,UNITED STATES,psrc
U01CA274489,Analytical tools for studying the tumor microenvironment leveraging spatial transcriptomics,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Understanding the tumor microenvironment (TME) heterogeneity and architecture are key to stratify cancer patients responsive to immunotherapy and clinical outcome. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) is a powerful tool for studying the TME at the single-cell level, however, spatial information between single cells was not preserved in this technology, which is vital in studying the TME. In contrast, use of spatially resolved transcriptomics holds the promise in the understanding of the spatial contexture of the TME because of its power to capture the location of individual cells within the larger tissue architecture. Recently, commercialization of spatial transcriptomic (ST) technologies have allowed researchers to study at an unprecedented level the spatial architecture of the TME. Similar to other “omics” technologies, novel computational tools are urgently needed to decipher and infer biological meaning for these high-dimensional ST data. In addition to the need for methods for analyzing and visualizing ST data in its current form, there is the need to develop methods for the future state of ST, whereby the level of cellular resolution is vastly decreasing to the single cell level. Moreover, the application of multiple assays to one tissue sample is also producing multiple modalities measured on the same sample (e.g., scRNAseq, image-based cytometry methods such as multiplex immunofluorescence) which requires effective methods for data integration. Lastly, many ST studies are completed on multiple samples simultaneous with the goal of correlating TME features with clinical outcome, thus requiring computational tools to unravel the impact of the spatial architecture of the TME on clinical response. In the proposed research, we will tackle these challenges by implementing state-of- the-art statistical and computational methods that account for and leverage the spatial information present in ST data to understanding the TME. We will develop innovative methods for assessing the TME’s composition (Aim 1) and studying co-localization and spatial heterogeneity (Aim 2), along with hardening of the analytical software, spatialGE, for the analysis and visualization of ST data (Aim 3). The statistical and bioinformatics analytical approaches implemented in spatialGE will allow cancer researchers to easily leverage these methods in their studies of the TME. These analytical methods, along with the developed software tools (spatialGE R/Bioconductor package along with web-based software), will be established in collaboration with clinical, translational, and basic science cancer investigators to ensure usability and interpretability of the developed approaches.",2022-09-01T12:09:00Z,2025-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-21-014,nofo_RFA-CA-21-014,H.

U01CA274573,Personalization of graphical models using multi-omics data for subtype discovery and prognosis,"SUMMARY Recent clinical advances in cancer treatments have been attributed to targeting specific genes such as ER-𝛼, HER2, etc. However, a significant percentage of patients do not respond to targeted therapies or develop resistance over time. This implies that current methods for tumor characterization and therapeutic interventions are not sufficiently accurate. In particular, current disease/patient subtyping approaches all look for differences at the level of individual genes, ignoring pathway-level interactions that can hold key characteristics of cancer disparities. The main goal of this project is to pioneer a new approach to disease/patient subtyping that departs from the traditional paradigm: subtyping and characterization at the pathway level, using personalized pathway profiles, rather than at the gene level. The hypothesis driving this work is that an emerging condition for an individual patient can be triggered through different genes and molecular levels (e.g., transcriptome, epigenome, etc.) but might involve the same mechanism(s). This is because, while alterations of impacted genes could be very diverse between patients the pathways involved could be the same. The innovation of this work is the development of a novel approach able to compute pathway profiles of individual patients by effectively taking into account gene topology and pathway crosstalk. Fundamental to this approach is effective integration of multi-omics and multi-cohort data to take advantage of complimentary information among different data types and address the small size problem associated with many cohorts. The goal of this project will be achieved through four specific aims: 1a) identify impacted pathways in individual patients, 1b) integrate mutation, copy number variation, methylation, microRNA, and gene expression, 2) integrate multi-cohort data, 3) identify pathway signatures for each subtype, and 4) validate the proposed pathway-level subtyping methodology and associated risk prediction by leveraging public data as well as data from two clinical studies at UPMC Hillman Cancer Center. The significance of the proposed work lies on its potential to provide new methods and tools for better cancer management and prognosis. In the longer term, personalized pathway analysis will improve our understanding of disease mechanisms and resistance to treatments, enabling the development of new treatments for personalized medicine. The methods and tools will be made available through an open-access web application and a CRAN R package.",2023-09-15T12:09:00Z,2026-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-22-022,nofo_RFA-CA-22-022,AUBURN UNIVERSITY AT AUBURN,Auburn,AL,UNITED STATES,itcr
U01CA274576,Robust privacy preserving distributed analysis platform for cancer research: addressing data bias and disparities,"Project Summary Privacy-preserving distributed analysis has gained increasing interests in the broad biomedical research community in recent years, as it can a) eliminate the need to create, maintain, and secure access to central data repositories, b) minimize the need to disclose protected health information outside the data-owning entity, and c) mitigate many security, proprietary, privacy and other concerns. As such, it offers great promises in lowering regulatory and other hurdles for collaboration across multiple institutions and enhancing the public trust in biomedical research. Equally important, analysis of health data from multiple institutions across the US would yield more robust and generalizable findings. This is particularly relevant in cancer disparities research as the sample size for minority groups can be very small from one institution. However, there remain significant methodological gaps in the current state-of-the-art for privacy-preserving distributed analysis. Most notably, missing data present significant challenges, as they are ubiquitous in biomedical data including, but not limited to, electronic health records (EHR). It is well known that missing data is a major source of bias in EHR. For example, patients from minority groups and those who have less access to private insurance tend to have more missing data in their EHR. Biased data as a result of missing data are known to yield unfair statistical and machine learning models, which in turn can perpetuate and exacerbate health inequities and disparities. There has been no work on principled approaches for properly handling missing data in distributed analysis beyond our recent works. In addition, it is well-known that distributed analysis is still at risk of revealing important individual-level information and lacks rigorous guarantee in the sense of differential privacy, the prevailing notion and metric for privacy protection. To address these significant limitations, we propose three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will refine and develop state-of-the-art imputation methods for handling missing data in distributed analysis and develop advanced functionalities for enhanced privacy protection through differential privacy control and homomorphic encryption. Building on the methods developed in Aim 1, we will develop an open-source and open-access distributed analysis platform that includes a robust system architecture and user-friendly GUI in Aim 2. We will assess and validate our distributed analysis platform using real-world use cases in cancer disparities research in Aim 3. With the enhanced privacy protection, our proposed distributed analysis platform will have the potential to further enhance public trust and lowerhurdles for collaboration across multiple institutions in cancer research. As such, our platform will enable researchers to use more information and less biased data in cancer research, enhance the validity, robustness and generalizability of research findings, and offer research substantial benefits in areas including, but not limited to, cancer disparities and informatics practice.",2023-06-01T12:06:00Z,2026-05-31T12:05:00Z,RFA-CA-22-022,nofo_RFA-CA-22-022,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,PHILADELPHIA,PA,UNITED STATES,itcr
U01CA274631,Matching genotypes with personalized therapies: Development of a decision support infrastructure to augment the value of precision medicine,"Project Summary Despite the progress made in precision oncology, clinicians typically face a vast volume and variety of next- generation sequencing and molecular data that is frequently intuitively processed to support high-stakes decisions. Overall, currently available resources that assist with next-generation sequence data interpretation are limited by manually performed, complex, time-consuming, and error-prone gene queries and ultimately lack the necessary information for prioritizing emerging therapies in a scalable manner. Importantly, the integration of genomic with clinical data has been severely hampered by the lack of advanced analytical tools that match genomic targets with molecularly-driven therapies. These barriers, together with health disparities, widen the gap between an exponentially increasing drug development field and the actual benefits for patients with cancer. The overarching goal of the proposed research is to link clinical with computational precision oncology and enable clinical decision-making in genomically defined groups. We propose to develop a precision oncology decision support framework for automated, scalable, and precise matching of actionable next-generation sequencing findings with targeted therapies. We will then test its clinical utility and value in the several clinical settings within the Johns Hopkins Molecular Tumor Board, in Johns Hopkins partnering community medical centers as well within two ongoing clinical trials for women with breast cancer. To enhance the generalizability of our analytical toolkit past our local academic environment, we have designed the platform's architecture such that it allows for ingestion and harmonization of next-generation sequence data from multiple sources, implements a common data model to map clinical elements to standardized terminologies and leverages ensemble natural language processing to generate actionable mutation-targeted therapy pairs. These attributes provide the foundation for the toolkit's potential widespread use and implementation in health care settings outside our local academic environment. While significant advances have been made in advanced diagnostics for tumor profiling, a solid backbone that supports the practical implementation within and across health care systems is lacking. The underlying premise of the proposed research is that it will ignite cross-institutional real-world genomic data analysis initiatives and genotype-driven clinical trials that will be beneficial for health systems and patients. Notably, our precision oncology decision support platform will enhance the implementation of precision oncology at institutions that do not readily have access to in-house expertise in clinical genomics. We envision that this streamlined automatic and scalable process will improve care, enhance patient outcomes and define national standards in how treatments are selected and tailored to individual patients.",2023-08-01T12:08:00Z,2026-07-31T12:07:00Z,RFA-CA-22-022,nofo_RFA-CA-22-022,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,BALTIMORE,MD,UNITED STATES,itcr
U01CA274970,Precision Clinical Trial Recruitment to Promote Cancer Health Equity Across Florida,"PROJECT SUMMARY Racial and ethnic minorities represent the fastest growing segment of the United States adult population, yet they remain significantly underrepresented in cancer clinical trials (CCTs). Low trust in clinical research and recruitment approaches that fail to address multilevel barriers to CCT participation are key reasons for minority population underrepresentation. Community health educators (CHEs) improve trust in research among underrepresented populations, yet relying on exclusively on CHE availability can limit intervention reach. Virtual CHEs (vCHEs) improve scalability by extending CHE capabilities and capitalizing on remote recruitment techniques. The purpose of the current project is to increase referral of diverse participants to NCI-supported clinical trials via a culturally responsive, multi-level intervention that utilizes vCHEs to reach diverse populations. We will consolidate existing referral channels within the ALEX Research Portal. ALEX offers a custom experience for clinicians, CHEs, and patients to facilitate CCT referrals. Clinicians can utilize the portal to refer to CCTs; CHEs can use the portal to create an avatar that can provide introductory information to patients and schedule video-conference follow-ups; patients, families, and community members can use the portal to easily navigate to key information and make self- and other-referrals. The ability to streamline information to patients and CCT referrals to study coordinators is expected to improve the overall referral to CCTs. The ALEX Research Portal utilizes the adaptive virtual human technology developed at the University of Florida that provides users with culturally and linguistically tailored CCT information. The ALEX Research Portal will be developed and launched across three distinct geographic areas of Florida (Gainesville, Jacksonville, and Miami). This unique collaborative opportunity will provide access to participants representative of the racial and ethnic diversity of the state as well as cancer centers conducting CCTs associated with national networks (ETCTN, NCTN). Guided by the Interactive Systems Framework for dissemination and implementation, our goal is to increase referrals to CCTs by optimizing the ALEX Research Portal for broad use. The outcome will be an evidence-based intervention that can be widely disseminated to quickly increase the referral of diverse patients to CCTs. This project will be conducted in three phases: (Phase I) establish a baseline of referrals and accrual of diverse participants to CCTs across multiple Florida Center Centers, (Phase 2) adapt and pilot the ALEX Research Portal using a randomized controlled clinical trial, and (Phase 3) scale the intervention by dissemination via the OneFlorida network. The proposed study will result in an empirically-tested vCHE Research Portal for increasing trust in CCTs among diverse populations that can easily be adapted and disseminated across the state to overcome challenges associated with recruiting diverse participants to CCTs.",2022-09-09T12:09:00Z,2027-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-21-063,nofo_RFA-CA-21-063,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,GAINESVILLE,FL,UNITED STATES,cusp2ct
U01CA274971,"Advancing Clinical Trials: Working through Outreach, Navigation and Digital Enabled Referral and Recruitment Strategies (ACT WONDERS)","Abstract Limited participation of racial/ethnic minorities in therapeutic clinical trials perpetuates cancer care disparities. Not only do racial/ethnic minority patients have limited access to state-of-the art care offered through a clinical trial, but the small numbers of racial/ethnic minority participants reduces the generalizability of findings, thereby limiting the clinical use of new treatments. The vast majority of racial/ethnic minorities receive their care in community settings with community physicians. Increasing racial/ethnic minority referral and enrollment in clinical trials requires consideration of multiple levels of influence. Community patients, community physicians, and cancer center physicians all face barriers to referral and enrollment of racial/ethnic minorities to clinical trials including: knowledge, attitudes, trust, and logistics. To address these challenges, we have designed Advancing Clinical Trials: Working through Outreach via Navigation and Digital Enabled Referral and Recruitment Strategies (ACT WONDER2S), driven by longstanding community partnerships to address the needs of medically underserved populations, research to address racial/ethnic minority accrual to trials, and a highly integrated digitally driven approach to precision cancer care and clinical trials. Our multilevel intervention includes strategies that are delivered via a community health educator (CHE) and/or through digital approaches for the community patient (education, patient portal, CHE support), community physician (education, trial connect portal, cancer center physician engagement, and CHE support), and cancer center physician (education, trial connect portal, CHE support, recruitment dashboard). ACT WONDER2S will be implemented in identified priority zones within the catchment area of Moffitt Cancer Center that have a higher cancer burden among Black and/or Hispanic populations. Our primary outcome is minority enrollment to NCI- sponsored therapeutic clinical trials among Black and Hispanic patients with cancer in the two-year period following intervention. In a three-phase approach based on learner verification and user-centered design, we aim to: 1) Refine and finalize the ACT WONDER2S intervention components by conducting interviews assessing preferences for the design and functionality of the CHE-led and digitally driven interventions; 2) Implement and evaluate the impact of ACT WONDER2S on racial/ethnic minority patient referral and enrollment on NCI-sponsored cancer treatment trials using a historical control design; 3) Assess implementation outcomes and identify barriers and facilitators to ACT WONDER2S. This innovative intervention is unique in its multilevel systems approach that utilizes digital tools accessible to community patients, community physicians, and cancer center physicians, which is coupled with support from CHEs for each of these stakeholders. Our use of geospatial analytics to identify priority zones is a unique strength, along with methodological innovations that will integrate learner verification, user centered design, and implementation science to refine intervention components and make ACT WONDER2S a success.",2022-09-15T12:09:00Z,2027-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-21-063,nofo_RFA-CA-21-063,H.

U01CA274996,The ECOG-ACRIN SUPPORT Trial: Multilevel Intervention to Improve Diverse Enrollment in Cancer Clinical Trials,"ABSTRACT Inadequate diversity in clinical trials is widely recognized as a significant contributing factor to health disparities experienced by racial/ethnic minorities and other diverse populations in the US. This lack of parity calls for urgent initiatives aimed at increasing diversity in order to support more equitable representation in clinical research and bring the benefits of advances in healthcare forged by clinical research equitably to all. National Cancer Institute (NCI) supported clinical trials (CTs) are key drivers of innovations in cancer care; however racial/ethnic minorities, and Black and Latino populations in particular, are underrepresented in NCI-supported CTs and thus not able to fully benefit from cutting edge treatments and precision medicine. CT participation among Black and Latino populations continues to fall short and the multitude of structural, clinical, physician, and patient barriers warrant multilevel interventions to enhance referral and enrollment of Black and Latino patients to NCI-supported CTs. The ECOG-ACRIN Cancer Research Group (EA), as an NCORP Research Base, has engaged community providers and researchers through a robust research portfolio that spans Cancer Control, Cancer Prevention, and Cancer Care Delivery. We propose to leverage the collective resources of the EA, our team’s decades of work on improving diversity in clinical trials, and our foundational work in patient navigation and CT research literacy tools to create and evaluate an ECOG-ACRIN Trial SUPPORT Toolkit (SUPPORT intervention) that aims to improve Black and Latino referral and enrollment in active NCI-supported therapeutic trials in head and neck, thoracic, and genitourinary cancers, and leukemia and myeloma. The multilevel EA SUPPORT intervention consists of a CT research literacy tool and CT Resource Navigators based at EA who will interface with patients, providers, and community oncology site staff to improve referral and enrollment of Black and Latino patients to CTs. Our specific aims are to: 1) Conduct preliminary assessments and refine the EA SUPPORT intervention with focus on community representation and input. 2) Conduct a Hybrid Type 1 cluster-randomized, roll-out effectiveness-implementation trial in 10 NCORP community oncology practice sites (with N= 500 Black and Latino patients with cancer) to evaluate the effectiveness of the EA SUPPORT intervention in improving Black and Latino patient referral and enrollment to NCI-supported CTs (primary outcomes) and participant and provider awareness and knowledge of CTs (secondary outcomes) while assessing implementation factors. 3) With the CUSP2CT Data, Evaluation, and Coordinating Center, conduct final site evaluation and disseminate the SUPPORT intervention to NCORP community oncology sites, research bases, and affiliated trial networks. Our collaborative infrastructure and EA SUPPORT multilevel intervention will shift the current clinical trial research base referral and enrollment paradigm and directly remove multiple levels of barriers through innovations in CT navigation and CT research literacy tools.",2022-09-15T12:09:00Z,2027-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-21-063,nofo_RFA-CA-21-063,ECOG-ACRIN MEDICAL RESEARCH FOUNDATION,PHILADELPHIA,PA,UNITED STATES,cusp2ct
U01CA274999,OSUCCC CUSP2CT,"PROJECT SUMMARY The overall goal of The Ohio State University (OSU) Connecting Underrepresented Populations to Clinical Trials (CUSP2CT) is to increase the referral and accrual of racial/ethnic minorities to NCI's National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN) prevention/control and treatment trials at the OSU Comprehensive Cancer Center (OSUCCC). This research is grounded in the socioecologic model developed by the Centers for Population Health and Health Disparities (Warnecke, et al. Am J Public Health 2008) and utilizes the theoretical model, Accrual to Clinical Trials (Paskett, et al. Clin Adv Hematol Oncol 2003). The OSUCCC serves the catchment area of the state of Ohio where over 95% of our patients with cancer reside. Working closely with the OSUCCC Center for Cancer Health Equity (CCHE), OSUCCC National Outreach Network, community partner organizations, community providers in the OSUCCC referral area, James Hospital Network sites, NCI Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP) sites in Ohio, and the OSUCCC Clinical Trials Office, our goal will be accomplished by completing the following specific aims: 1) Conduct a baseline assessment of referral patterns and accrual of racial and ethnic minorities to clinical trials at OSUCCC by cancer disease group (breast, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, thoracic, hematologic, and others) and examine factors at the system (i.e., eligible clinical trial protocol, clinic context and culture), provider (trial discussed with patient), and patient level (agreed or refused participation) that influence referral and accrual (Phase I); 2) Implement a multi-level intervention in a stepped wedge design in referring practices in 9 counties with high counts of minority cancer cases in the OSUCCC catchment area using the Accrual to Clinical Trials framework (Paskett, et al. Clin Adv Hematol Oncol 2003), in Phase II. The intervention will include an outreach component, directed at community members and community practices, and an in-reach component, involving patients, providers, and the hospital system (at both referral centers and the OSUCCC) that directly addresses problems identified in Phase I; and 3) to evaluate the impact of the intervention on referral (primary outcome) and accrual patterns (secondary outcomes) in Phase III to clinical trials. Both qualitative and quantitative methods will be used. Dissemination of the key findings of our multi-level intervention is a high priority of this project.",2022-09-12T12:09:00Z,2027-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-21-063,nofo_RFA-CA-21-063,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,COLUMBUS,OH,UNITED STATES,cusp2ct
U01CA275808,Modeling based design of chimeric antigen receptors for Natural Killer cell-based immunotherapy,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Natural killer (NK) cells are innate immune effector cells that play an immediate role in host defense. The activation of NK cells is mediated by receptor-ligand interactions and downstream intracellular signaling path- ways. One type of immunotherapy that has achieved great success in recent years is based on chimeric antigen receptors (CARs). These are engineered receptors composed of both target recognition and cell activation func- tions that can direct immune cells to mediate killing of cancer cells. Although T cells are the predominant immune cell type used for CAR-based immunotherapy, NK cells provide significant advantages over CAR-engineered T cells because they can be derived from non-autologous sources. However, most studies testing CAR-NK cells have used CAR constructs based on T cell signaling pathways that are not optimized for NK cell signaling. In addition, the development of CAR constructs is largely achieved using a trial-and-error experimental approach, and there is no systematic understanding of how altering the CAR signaling domains influences cell activation. The main objective of this proposal is to identify effective NK based-CAR designs using systems biology tools. Our approach combines computational modeling and quantitative phospho-proteomics to generate a de- tailed understanding of CAR-mediated NK cell signaling and cytotoxicity. The outcome of our work will be a set of validated NK CARs that target and kill BCMA-positive multiple myeloma (MM) cancer cells. We will also test the optimized CARs against CS1-expressing MM cells. The approach builds on our team’s extensive experience in modeling and characterizing cell signaling and studying NK cell biology. Guided by strong preliminary data, we propose to pursue three Specific Aims: (1) Characterize intracellular and cellular-level responses of CAR- expressing NK cells; (2) Develop computational models to predict the dynamic responses of CAR-expressing NK cells; (3) Identify novel CAR constructs that effectively activate NK cells. Collectively, our proposed research will generate a quantitative understanding of how CAR signaling encodes NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity and how NK-CAR constructs can be optimized for cancer immunotherapy. Our research will broadly impact the field of cancer immunotherapy by providing insight into how intracellular NK cell signaling and CAR structure influence NK cell activation. Ultimately, this research will expand our knowledge of NK cell signaling and the design criteria for NK-CAR-based immunotherapy for other tumor types and cancer antigens. Our work has the potential to unlock the transformative power of NK-CAR cells for cancer immuno- therapy.",2022-09-09T12:09:00Z,2027-08-31T12:08:00Z,PAR-19-287,nofo_PAR-19-287,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,Los Angeles,CA,UNITED STATES,csbc
U01CA275886,Identifying and targeting collateral lethal vulnerabilities in cancers,"Identifying and targeting collateral lethal vulnerabilities in cancers Abstract/Summary Genomic deletions targeting major tumor suppressor genes frequently include adjacent passenger genes, encoding cell essential housekeeping functions. These cancer cells survive due to co-expressing functionally redundant paralogs residing in non-deleted regions of the genome. As such, these “collateral deletions” in tumor suppressor loci can confer cancer cell-specific vulnerabilities through targeted extinction of the remaining paralog. Our “collateral lethality” concept was first demonstrated in GBM with deletion of the 1p36 tumor suppressor locus encompassing ENO1, resulting in profound sensitivity to ENO2 depletion or pharmacologic inhibition (Muller et al. 2012). Subsequently, we demonstrated that deletion of mitochondrial malic enzyme 2 (ME2) in the SMAD4 locus engendered lethality upon shRNA-mediated depletion of the remaining mitochondrial malic enzyme activity encoded by the ME3 paralog (Dey et al. 2017). To systematically and comprehensively identify collateral lethal targets in cancer, we first analyzed the Broad Institute’s Cancer Dependency Map (DepMap), a publicly accessible database hosting essentiality scores of 17386 genes from a pooled genome- scale CRISPR knockout study conducted in 1054 cancer cell lines of diverse lineages (Dempster et al. 2019; Ghandi et al. 2019). The computational efforts yielded multiple collateral lethal candidate pairs including REEP3/4, PTDSS1/2, INTS6/INTS6L, PRPS1/2, LDHA/B, and CSTF2/CSTF2T via a two-class comparison method that regressed cell line sensitivity vectors against whole-genome CCLE expression and copy number data to predict paralog-depletion based sensitivity. While computational analysis of DepMap data can identify some candidate collateral lethal pairs, small sample sizes for many collateral deletions have stymied robust conclusions. Building on these computational methods, here we will apply the CRISPR/Cas12a polygenic knockout platform to systematically identify collateral lethal pairs anchored in deletion events targeting common tumor suppressor gene loci such as TP53, CDKN2A/B, ARID1A, PTEN, SMAD4, RB1 and NF1 across cancer types. This conceptual and experimental framework, coupled with a cell/organoid/tumor validation platform, seeks to identify and stringently validate collateral lethal target sets that can then be channeled into a drug discovery pipeline with the goal of expanding precision cancer treatments.",2023-04-01T12:04:00Z,2028-03-31T12:03:00Z,PAR-21-274,nofo_PAR-21-274,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,HOUSTON,TX,UNITED STATES,ctd_2
U01CA279618,m6A-suite: an informatics pipeline and resource for elucidating roles of m6A epitranscriptome in cancer,"Project Summary N6-methyl-adenosine (m6A) is the most abundant mRNA methylation in mammalian cells. Emerging evidence has linked m6A with cancer phenotypes in many cancers, spurring a surge of research in studying m6A and cancer biology. However, dysregulation of m6A effector writers, erasers, and readers and reprogramming of m6A sites are poorly characterized. How different modes of m6A-regulation of gene expression mediate the downstream cancer pathways and phenotypes is mostly missing. We have developed several widely used informatics tools for m6A peak detection, differential m6A analysis, and functional predictions for m6A targets from MeRIP-seq m6A profiling data. Using these tools, we worked together with cancer biology collaborators to reveal reprogramed viral and host m6A epitranscriptome in cells infected by the oncogenic virus KSHV and discovered a cross-talk between m6A writers, erasers, and readers to regulate cancer growth and progression. However, the fast-moving m6A and cancer research poses many unmet informatics challenges. Among them, the ability to accurately identify single-base m6A sites and predict key m6A regulatory mechanisms from profiling data is seriously lacking. Also, a comprehensive database that catalogs and enables queries of where, what, and how of m6A methylation and function in normal and cancer conditions is highly desirable. To address challenges, we propose to develop m6A-Suite, an informatics toolbox, pipeline, and resources to facilitate the mechanistic study of m6A in cancer. A key obstacle to developing tools in m6A-Suite is a lack of large, high- quality training datasets. Toward this end, we have collected 1,113 human and 680 mouse MeRIP-seq samples from cancer cell lines, tumors, and normal tissues and identified >4M m6A peaks. In parallel, we have also collected 194,060 single-base m6A sites in 9 cell lines and 3 tissues. We propose to leverage this data to construct the highly desirable training datasets. Using these datasets, we will develop efficient and accurate tools for single-base m6A detection and quantification from MeRIP-seq and nanopore data (Aim 1), enable the prediction of m6A-mediated RNA decay and splicing (Aim 2), and establish the comprehensive, queriable m6A- KB knowledgbase to catalog these predictions in an extensive collection of public MeRIP-seq and nanopore data in cancer and normal cells, and tissues in diverse conditions(Aim 3). We will systematically test and evaluate these tools within this project and through many established and emerging collaborations inside and outside the ITCR consortium. We will make the tools and data freely available to the research community and constantly seek feedback from the collaborators and users for improvement. Given the emerging nature of m6A and cancer research, the addition of these tools to the ITCR program will positively impact this important, fast-growing, new area of cancer research.",2023-04-11T12:04:00Z,2026-03-31T12:03:00Z,RFA-CA-22-022,nofo_RFA-CA-22-022,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,PITTSBURGH,PA,UNITED STATES,itcr
U01CA281902,Systematic Characterization and Targeting of Neomorphic Drivers in Cancer,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT More than 3 million somatic mutations and fusion genes have been identified in cancer. However, our ability to predict functional consequences and the therapeutic relevance of these somatic aberrations remains a major challenge. More critically, we have not solved the challenge of how to effectively target neomorphic aberrations where functional consequences on tumor cell-intrinsic or tumor microenvironment processes are altered through critical changes in regulatory processes, binding partners, or cellular locations, leading to novel and unpredictable functions. To address this challenge, in response to PAR-21-274, we propose a CTD2 Center that will employ identify, biomarkers. state-of-the-art, high-throughput computational and experimental approaches to characterize, validate, and target novel neomorphic drivers as well as nominate related predictive We have selected glioma, sarcoma, and endometrial cancers for proof of concept as they represent high unmet need cancer types that are driven by point mutations and fusion genes and encompass divergent tissues of origin. Of the driver genes we identified, ~15% of the point mutations and ~30% of the fusions are estimated to have neomorphic effects. understanding metastasis possibly determine strategies Our application wil address three key areas listed in the PAR: (i) improve of gene functions in pathways and cellular wiring important in cancer initiation, progression, and within the context of a few human tumors; (ii) identify and confirm candidate biological targets, and associated predictive markers, involved in cancer etiology which are amenable to modulation; and (iii) how these context-specific neomorphic pathways can be harnessed in combination with established that target the immune system, and identify mechanisms of resistance. Based on the success of our l current CTD2 project, we have assembled a collaborative, productive, interdisciplinary team comprising Drs. Mills (tumor biology/clinical trials), Deneen (molecular genetics/electroporation tumor models), Liang (computational biology), and Chen (innovative algorithms) and will pursue three Specific Aims; Aim 1: To develop computational algorithms for predicting neomorphic driver aberrations. Aim 2: To identify and elucidate mechanisms underlying potential neomorphic driver aberrations. Aim 3: To elucidate therapeutic liabilities engendered by neomorphic driver aberrations. We have chosen to evaluate neomorphic drivers because they, as a class, have new and unpredictable functions that confound molecularly informed decisions, potentially contributing to the failure of targeted therapy in many patients. By understanding how neomorphic aberrations affect downstream function within the protein and cellular pathways in tumor cells and the tumor microenvironment, we will identify therapeutic opportunities that can be directly tested in human clinical trials, as demonstrated in the current CTD2 project (>10 trials launched). Importantly, our focus on modeling known and predicted neomorphic mutations and fusion genes in autochthonous models will complement other CTD2 Centers' modeling of loss-of-function (LOF) events using RNAi and CRISPR/Cas9 strategies.",2023-09-19T12:09:00Z,2028-08-31T12:08:00Z,PAR-21-274,nofo_PAR-21-274,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,PORTLAND,OR,UNITED STATES,ctd_2
U01CA281905,"Clinical, molecular, and immune characterization of naturally occurring osteosarcoma in dogs","PROJECT SUMMARY Naturally occurring osteosarcoma in dogs has been proposed as a promising translational platform to serve as an intermediary between mouse studies and human clinical trials because it develops in the presence of a fully intact immune system and demonstrates a similar clinical progression to the human disease. Furthermore, canine osteosarcoma is a naturally occurring, heterogenous disease that recapitulates the spectrum of histopathologic, immunologic, and genomic complexity of the disease in humans. However, despite the promise of the dog model, the true translational potential of this model remains unproven and important species differences in overall outcomes exist that are often not accounted for in the traditional design of translationally focused dog trials. To optimize the design and translational impact of canine osteosarcoma trials moving forward, this proposal seeks to establish the breadth and range of natural outcomes for this disease together with deep characterization of the tumor microenvironment and immune landscape. To attain these objectives, we propose the following two aims, 1) Determine natural disease progression and outcomes in a contemporaneous prospectively enrolled population of dogs treated surgically for naturally occurring osteosarcoma, and 2) Inform optimal design and establish biologically based outcome assessments for translational canine osteosarcoma studies. This work will enroll client-owned dogs with naturally occurring osteosarcoma through the NCI Comparative Oncology Trials Consortium (COTC), a well-established trials network of veterinary academic institutions. In addition to primary clinical outcome measures for dogs treated with surgery alone, deep characterization of the tumor microenvironment and immune landscape will allow us to better understand the impacts of inherent biology and chemotherapy resistance, define the role of the immune system in the natural progression of disease, and to compare molecular and immune signatures between pre- existing human and canine osteosarcoma datasets. Hence, this canine trial paired with correlative bio-marker studies are aimed to expand and improve the utility of the canine osteosarcoma model by ensuring that future dog trials can be optimally designed to provide reliable information for the benefit of human patients with chemotherapy resistant osteosarcoma.",2023-08-01T12:08:00Z,2028-07-31T12:07:00Z,PAR-20-131,nofo_PAR-20-131,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,DAVIS,CA,UNITED STATES,omf
U01CA282109,A Patient-Centric Approach to Advance Functional Precision Oncology,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The development of drug resistance is a major cause of cancer treatment failure and mortality. Although much is known about the mechanisms by which tumor cells can become resistant to a given drug, translating this into effective therapeutic solutions remains an unmet clinical need. Here we propose to pioneer the use of patient derived tumor organoids (PDTOs) as a platform to identify and validate novel targets and effective drugs to overcome drug resistance in ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, and other tumor types. In our preliminary studies, we show that PDTOs genetically and phenotypically match the tumor from which they were derived and can be used to study the phenotypic consequences of tumor heterogeneity, tumor evolution, and drug resistance. Using a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) approved high complexity assay, we show that PDTO drug sensitivities are highly concordant with known genetic biomarkers, retrospective treatment history and prospective patient responses. Tumor organoids derived from patients who developed in situ drug resistance demonstrate ex vivo resistance to those same drugs but also demonstrate sensitivity to other alternative oncology drugs. Additional preliminary studies show stable disease or tumor regression in patients treated with drugs identified from organoid drug screens. Here, we propose to combine drug screening and molecular profiling of PDTOs derived from a given patient from different anatomic tumor sites and before and after therapy to elucidate the mechanistic basis for drug sensitivity or resistance and to identify novel targets and effective drugs to treat metastatic, drug resistant cancers. Accompanying computational prediction models that integrate large public datasets as well as innovative methods of mechanistic target validation including CRISPR, targeted protein degradation technologies, and epigenetic profiling, will be used to prioritize and advance targets and associated biomarkers with greatest clinical potential. The rationale behind our approach is that identifying targets and effective drugs directly in patient derived samples with known clinical history and outcomes will significantly enhance translation of our findings. This proposal is significant because it will demonstrate the utility of PDTOs as both a research tool for target discovery and validation but also as a clinically useful platform to guide functional precision medicine. The findings and methods developed can be readily applied to other cancer types and clinical challenges, will accelerate preclinical drug and drug target development, and will translate to clinical studies. The models, approaches, and expected outcomes of this proposal are highly responsive to the requirements of PAR-21-274.",2023-09-22T12:09:00Z,2028-08-31T12:08:00Z,PAR-21-274,nofo_PAR-21-274,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER CENTER,Seattle,WA,UNITED STATES,ctd_2
U01CA282114,Spatial functional genomics to identify regulators of the tumor microenvironment and cancer immunity,"PROJECT SUMMARY Tumor growth and response to therapy, particularly immunotherapy, are all highly dependent on the tumor microenvironment (TME): the collection of cells and extracellular factors (cytokines, chemokines, collagens, etc.) that form around cancer cells. This is evident from the major impact drugs targeting TME components can have on cancers, including immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). Though there is a relatively good understanding of key genes regulating cancer cell intrinsic processes, such as cell cycle, there is less known about genes controlling the extrinsic environment that protects cancer cells from immunity and aids growth. The objective of this project is to determine the genes controlling tumor composition and facilitating tumor growth and resistance to immunity & immunotherapy, with the goal of identifying vulnerability factors that can be targeted to enhance tumor immunity and improve cancer treatment. The overarching hypothesis, which forms the rationale for this U01, is that malignant cells turn on or off genes, including intrinsically operating genes, through mutations and selective gene expression, that act extrinsically to recruit, position, & polarize immune & stroma cells into a state that subverts immunity & facilitates tumor growth1, 2. To reach our objective, we will employ a first-of-its-kind spatial functional genomics platform, called Perturb-map, which permits extensive phenotypic analysis of dozens of single or multiple gene perturbations in a tumor at single cell resolution and with spatial architecture preserved. With Perturb-map, CRISPR knockout (KO) or cDNA overexpression (OE) screens are resolved by multiplex imaging & spatial transcriptomics (ST), and this allows study of entire classes of genes (e.g. secreted factors) and phenotypes (e.g. TME composition) not feasible with existing screens. We will use Perturb-map to determine the role of 100s of genes in controlling many critical tumor processes, including tumor: (i) growth, (ii) morphology, (iii) metastasis, (iv) cell-cell interactions, (v) subclonal interactions, (vi) immune/stroma recruitment & polarization, (vii) resistance to immunotherapy & other treatments. The breadth & depth of analysis of each gene will be achieved at a scale and efficiency not previously feasible. We will focus on 3 broad categories of genes, identified through analysis of TCGA, ICB-treated cohorts, single cell-omics, and other patient data, including: commonly mutated cancer genes in solid tumors (Aim 1), genes correlating with resistance or response to ICB immunotherapy (Aim 2), and cancer cell-derived ligands and secreted molecules (Aim 3). Studies will be carried out in immunocompetent, orthotopic models of non-small cell lung carcinoma, high grade serous ovarian carcinoma, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and oral squamous cell carcinoma. The study outcome will determine the roles of 100s of genes in many processes critical to unimpeded cancer growth, including identifying genes shielding cancers from immunity. In doing so, they will generate insights into mechanisms of aggressive tumor behavior and treatment resistance that will help to improve and personalize treatment selection and drive the immediate next steps towards the development of novel therapeutic strategies.",2023-09-19T12:09:00Z,2028-08-31T12:08:00Z,PAR-21-274,nofo_PAR-21-274,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,NEW YORK,NY,UNITED STATES,ctd_2
U01CA283931,Liquid biopsy and radiomics for liver cancer surveillance,"ABSTRACT Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fastest growing cause of cancer death in the United States. While prevention efforts are paramount, most patients succumb to advanced HCC disease. Thus, enrollment of at- risk patients (e.g., cirrhosis of any etiology) in early detection programs is recommended in clinical practice guidelines. Longstanding challenges to improving early-stage HCC detection are suboptimal performance of the recommended surveillance tools [i.e., abdominal ultrasound and serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)] and the low implementation rate of surveillance programs (as low as 25% in the United States). Various studies have tried to utilize tumor nucleic acids released to the bloodstream (i.e., “liquid biopsy”) as novel early HCC detection tools, but its role in this clinical setting is largely unexplored. Up to 18% of patients with cirrhosis have indeterminate nodules detected during surveillance. In these patients, imaging is inconclusive, and patients require either a biopsy of the suspicious nodule and/or close imaging follow-up. Our project is designed to overcome these problems by using new blood-based liquid biopsy biomarkers and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based radiomics. We have assembled a multi-institutional Translational Research Center including leading academic centers in NYC (Mount Sinai, Columbia, Cornell, and Montefiore). We plan to collect blood, clinical and imaging data from a multiracial cohort of 2,560 patients (early HCC cases and controls at high risk). In Aim 1, we will determine the clinical role of new liquid biopsy technologies (i.e., cell-free DNA fragment analysis and a 3-small RNA signatures from extracellular vesicles in plasma) as a novel surveillance approach in HCC. In Aim 2, we will integrate MRI-based radiomics models with our liquid biopsy technologies to better characterize indeterminate nodules in cirrhosis. Our project is timely and uniquely poised to respond to the imperative of developing noninvasive biomarkers of early HCC detection.",2023-09-19T12:09:00Z,2028-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-22-031,nofo_RFA-CA-22-031,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,NEW YORK,NY,UNITED STATES,tlc
U01CA283935,Precision Risk Stratification and Screening for HCC among Patients with Indeterminate Liver Nodules,"PROJECT SUMMARY Large gaps in current strategies for risk stratification and surveillance contribute to frequent late-stage detection and poor outcomes in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Our Translational Liver Cancer (TLC) Research Center has made important scientific contributions that directly addressed HCC risk stratification and surveillance in patients with cirrhosis. Specifically, we conducted a series of phase II and phase III biomarker studies in patients with cirrhosis to validate 1) the first blood-based biomarker for risk stratification (PLSec-AFP), 2) abbreviated MRI for HCC surveillance, and 3) two biomarker panels, GALAD and Doylestown Plus for HCC surveillance. We also conducted modeling studies to evaluate how these data can be incorporated into clinical practice, evaluating the cost-effectiveness of a precision surveillance strategy in these patients. For our TLC renewal, we leverage our infrastructure and operational expertise to similarly develop an optimized, evidence-based approach to early HCC detection in patients with indeterminate liver nodules (ILNs). Our preliminary data demonstrate that patients with ILNs have an annual HCC risk of 6-10%/year, more than double that of those with cirrhosis without ILNs; however, they experience wide variation in HCC risk and surveillance strategies – with some patients who develop HCC failing to undergo surveillance in the year prior to diagnosis and some patients undergoing repeated CT/MRI-based surveillance despite never developing HCC. Our work highlights the need for accurate risk stratification and surveillance strategies in patients with ILNs to optimize the overall value of early HCC detection programs – gaps that are directly addressed by our proposal. We will leverage our Early Detection Research Network (EDRN)-funded Clinical Validation Center for HCC to efficiently recruit a large cohort of patients with ILNs and (1) validate the effectiveness of a novel biomarker- based risk stratification model, (2) evaluate the effectiveness of surveillance abbreviated MRI and contrast enhanced ultrasound for detecting early-stage HCC, and (3) compare the cost effectiveness of surveillance strategies including a precision screening model in patients with ILNs. Our proposal aligns with the principles of precision medicine and would maximize benefits (via early tumor detection) and minimize harms (via false positive results) for each patient, thereby optimizing the patient- centeredness, cost effectiveness, and overall value of HCC surveillance in patients with ILNs. In addition to our patient cohorts and platform of unique biomarker and imaging data, our TLC research center will contribute methodological expertise in HCC early detection, biomarker validation, and HCC imaging to trans-network projects. Overall, our proposal will transform our approach to early HCC detection in patients with ILNs by validating evidence-based and cost-effective strategies to optimize HCC risk stratification and surveillance.",2023-09-19T12:09:00Z,2028-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-22-031,nofo_RFA-CA-22-031,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,DALLAS,TX,UNITED STATES,tlc
U01CA284193,Inferring Kinase Activity from Tumor Phosphoproteomic Data,"Project Summary Kinases are fundamentally important enzymes for regulating cell physiology through regulation of proteins and protein interactions by phosphorylating tyrosine, serine, and threonine residues. Kinase dysregulation is often a contributor to cancer progression, which is why kinase inhibitors are one of the largest classes of FDA-approved drugs for oncology. However, many challenges still remain in providing precision-based kinase therapy to pa- tients, such as failure to respond to therapy and the development of resistance to therapy through diverse means. This project seeks to advance a promising new approach (called KSTAR) for understanding kinase dysregulation in cancer by inferring the activity of kinases in tumor biopsies, based on their phosphoproteomic proﬁles. KSTAR is a ﬁrst-in class algorithm that can operate on any type of phosphoproteomic data, not requiring paired quantita- tive comparison tissues, and is signiﬁcantly more robust than other available approaches. KSTAR was shown to compliment clinical standard of care by identifying failure to respond to therapy and misclassiﬁcation of patients as HER2-positive or negative, which departed from HER2-activity. Working with collaborators across a range of solid cancers, we seek to further KSTAR's ability to help researchers and clinicians better match kinase inhibitor therapies, based on patient molecular kinase activity proﬁles.

U01CA284207,Visual Analytics for Exploration and Hypothesis Generation Using Highly MultiplexedSpatial Data of Tissues and Tumors,"PROJECT SUMMARY The recent development of highly multiplexed subcellular resolution tissue imaging promises to accelerate research into tumor initiation, progression, and immune surveillance and ultimately aid in the discovery of new biomarkers usable in a clinical setting. In parallel, spatially resolved measurement of transcript and small molecule abundances is achieving near single-cell resolution. NCI programs such as the Human Tumor Atlas Network (HTAN) are capitalizing on these developments to create public data repositories (“Tissue Atlases”) similar in scope and ambition to The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The greatest barriers to making such data routinely accessible to basic and translational cancer biologists lie not in data collection but rather data visualization and analysis. Existing software tools designed for cultured cell experiments or hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) based digital pathology are inadequate for high-plex data applications, and emerging tools do not meet the needs of either low-cost and efficient data sharing or sophisticated multi-modal machine learning from diverse data. This Informatics Technology for Cancer Research (ITCR) project will therefore develop, harden, and test standards-compliant software tools that make it possible to visualize, annotate, and quantify features of the tumor microenvironment spanning a 105-fold range in length scale (from ~100 nm to 1 cm) by building on a suite of interoperable, cloud-based MINERVA tools that also work well with existing commercial and open-source software. Key user communities include cell biologists, microscopists, pathologists and oncologists with expertise in imaging and tissue biology and computational biologists and bioinformaticians who process and integrate image and ‘omic data into atlases. These users work closely together in our laboratories but have distinct needs. Our tools will therefore support three phases of research: (i) initial data exploration via intuitive and easy-to-deploy web-based tools; (ii) hypothesis generation and testing via sophisticated ML-enabled visual analytics; and (iii) data publication and integration with existing knowledge, databases, and atlases. Our innovations will include the latest advances in visual encoding, ML/AI, and human-computer interfaces that enable human-in-the-loop analysis and explanatory and exploratory data visualization. Aim 1 will establish light-weight methods for low-cost visualization and communication of multiplex IF, H&E, and spatial omics data collected by HTAN and similar international consortia. Aim 2 will develop new ways for deeply exploring and analyzing the spatial data for hypothesis generation and testing, with a focus on quantifying morphology and cell-cell interactions in 2D whole-slide and high-resolution 3D images. Aim 3 will expand our MINERVA platform to enable collaborative analysis and data sharing across different audiences and data types to better understand how tumor architecture changes with disease progression and treatment. Together, our software will promote efficient hypothesis generation and testing from complex, multi-modal datasets as well as their annotation and distribution in accordance with FAIR data principles.",2023-09-12T12:09:00Z,2026-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-22-022,nofo_RFA-CA-22-022,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,BOSTON,MA,UNITED STATES,itcr
U01DE028227,Stimulating Neo-Antigen Specific T Cell Responses in Head and Neck Cancers,"Abstract Neoantigens (NeoAg) offer a unique and powerful opportunity for directing a patient’s immune response specifically to cancer cells while avoiding damage to normal tissues. Methods for their reliable identification in tumors of moderate mutational burden such as head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) are lacking, however, as are preclinical experimental platforms for utilizing human material to understand the possibilities and impediments in enabling NeoAg-specific T cells to eradicate established tumors. Working with a focused and collaborative team with expertise in cellular and molecular immunology, bioinformatics, and translational oncology, we have developed a set of novel tools and approaches to address the complex tumor/immune ecosystem in new and incisive ways. These include a unique new model of tobacco-induced HNSCC carcinogenesis which recapitulates many key features of the human disease including gene expression patterns of activated oncogenes, a powerful new combined bioinformatic and functional analysis platform the identification of NeoAg by these tumors can be recognized by the host immune system, a novel preclinical model of combination radio-immunotherapy through which NeoAg-specific responses can be induced and sustained (Sharabi/Sharma), and finally, a new preclinical model of tumor-induced unresponsiveness in the setting of adoptive cellular therapy using human HNSCC patient-derived xenograft (PDX) tumors and patient-matched tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) specific for an identified NeoAg. Together, these studies will address the hypothesis that autologous NeoAg-specific T cells can eradicate HNSCC tumors as well as defining the key quantitative and qualitative parameters governing therapeutic efficacy.",2018-09-18T12:09:00Z,2024-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-17-045,nofo_RFA-CA-17-045,LA JOLLA INSTITUTE FOR IMMUNOLOGY,LA JOLLA,CA,UNITED STATES,iotn
U01DE028233,Targeting the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment to enhance efficacy of radiotherapy and immuno-radiotherapy for oral cancer,"PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT: Radiation therapy (RT) is a mainstay of cancer treatment. However many tumors are resistant to RT, making it possible for microscopic tumor cells to remain or travel to other parts of the body and cause cancer recurrence at a later date. Immunotherapies can train the patient’s immune system to seek out and identify hidden tumor cells. The combination of RT with immunotherapy is a very exciting approach, but RT can have both immune- stimulating and immune suppressive effects, and further study is needed to understand how best to combine RT with immunotherapy. Many scientists now believe that understanding the tumor microenvironment – the types of cells which make up a tumor, and their interactions – is required to maximize the immune-stimulating effects of RT. We have discovered a strategy to alter the balance of cells in the tumor microenvironment of oral cancer and other solid tumor types, by simultaneously targeting immunosuppressive myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and regulatory T cells (Treg), so that immune-stimulating effects of RT predominate. Studies in mouse tumors show that this strategy is particularly effective when combined with an immunotherapy approach called “checkpoint inhibition” that targets molecules that limit effectiveness of anti- tumor T cells. This leads to our scientific hypothesis that tumor-infiltrating MDSC and Treg render the tumor microenvironment resistant to immune activation by RT and/or checkpoint inhibition, and limit the induction of tumor-specific CD8+ T cells and other immune effector immune cells. The goals of this proposal are to 1) determine whether modulating the tumor immune microenvironment enhances responsiveness of oral cancer to RT and/or checkpoint inhibition, leading to long-lasting and powerful anti-tumor effects; 2) determine the immunological mechanisms which make these combination therapies effective; and 3) develop a novel drug formulation which will make this approach more effective and suitable for testing in clinical trials. We will accomplish these goals by carrying out the following specific aims: In Aim 1 we will functionally dissect the immune mechanisms by which MDSC contribute to radioresistance in mouse oral cancer models. In Aim 2 we will assess the ability of dual targeting of MDSC and Treg to sensitize oral cancer to treatment with RT + anti-PD-1 and induce durable protective memory responses. In Aim 3 we will develop a novel drug delivery system that can enhance delivery of inhibitors of MDSC function directly to the tumor and tumor-infiltrating MDSC.",2018-09-19T12:09:00Z,2024-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-17-045,nofo_RFA-CA-17-045,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,HOUSTON,TX,UNITED STATES,iotn
U01DE029188,Defining mechanisms of immunotherapy resistance in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT PD1 checkpoint blockade with nivolumab or pembrolizumab has given new hope for poor prognosis recurrent/metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients, but response rates of only 15-20% highlight the need for continued investigation. In this application, we have assembled a multidisciplinary team to address tumor cell intrinsic and adaptive resistance programs that are a critical barrier to immunotherapy. Together, this targeted and discovery based approach coupled with human functional immunophenotyping aims to generate new translational approaches to improving response rates for HNSCC patients. The foundation of this proposal is based on supporting data showing robust preclinical modeling platforms that span the spectrum of clinical responses to anti-PD1 therapy including response, intrinsic and adaptive resistance. Using high dimensional time of flight mass cytometry (CyTOF) and an isogenic model of response and resistance, we identified distinct tumor microenvironmental remodeling with anti-PD1 and anti- CTLA4 therapies. We also completed a genome scale CRISPR screen for T cell recognition in a PD1 resistant HNSCC model and identified 355 candidate genes that may regulate this interaction. Candidates included ones that may be relevant in all cancers as well as ones specific to HNSCCs. A major category to emerge from this and other screens represents targets in the chromatin accessibility pathway. We validated a top screen candidate that modulates chromatin accessibility, the histone methyltransferase and transcriptional regulator Ezh2, and identified reduced anti-PD-1 resistance in combination with Ezh2 targeting. These data illustrate the validity of our approach as well as potential for clinical translation, as agents targeting Ezh2 are currently in clinical development. In a separate study of immunotherapy treated HNSCC patients, we identified mutations in SMARCA4, a catalytic subunit key for the PBAF nucleosome remodeling complex, in immunotherapy responsive HNSCC patients, highlighting chromatin remodelers as modulators of immunotherapy response in patients and the potential for improved clinical management by targeting these activities in conjunction with immunotherapy. In the proposed work, we will complete analysis of Ezh2 targeting with further validation of candidate immunotherapy resistance modulators. Coupled with these preclinical studies we will complete functional immunophenotyping of human HNSCC patients using CyTOF and a novel patient derived organotypic platform. In parallel to these preclinical approaches, we have a strong clinical trial portfolio including a novel neoadjuvant pembrolizumab clinical trial that has shown surprising pathologic response in a subset of patients and highlights this approach as an ideal setting in which to address resistance mechanisms in previously untreated patients. We will interrogate genomic data from our neoadjuvant trial to assess resistance mechanisms defined in preclinical models. In conclusion, this integrated approach will define mechanistic and therapeutic approaches to address the intrinsic immunotherapy resistance in HNSCC.",2019-09-24T12:09:00Z,2024-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-19-015,nofo_RFA-CA-19-015,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,BOSTON,MA,UNITED STATES,iotn
U01DE029255,Robust Immuno-prevention Strategies for High-Risk Oral Epithelial Dysplasia,"PROJECT SUMMARY Immune checkpoint blockade has proven an effective treatment for a subset of head and neck cancer (HNC) patients. However, over 85% of the patients cannot benefit from this strategy, largely due to the highly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) in established cancers. Oral leukoplakias / Oral Epithelial Dysplasias (OEDs) precede HNC and offer a unique time window for disease eradication. However, surgical resection in the orofacial region results in significant morbidity and function loss, and more importantly, cannot reverse field cancerization. A subset of OEDs transform into malignancy despite vigilant follow-ups. Frequent immune cell infiltration is a common feature of OEDs, however, little is known about when and how OEDs evade from immuno-surveillance and reach a point-of-no-return. In addition, it remains unclear which sub- group of OEDs is more likely to suppress host immunity and establish themselves as high-risk lesions. Amplification of the chromosome locus 3q26.3 is a defining genomic feature of HNC, and two oncogenes at this locus inhibit innate immune sensing pathways and elicit a metabolic restraint in the TME, which collectively disadvantage anti-tumor immune cells. We have developed strategies to bypass the inhibition of innate immune sensing and synthesized a novel drug-like molecule that exhibits potent metabolic remodeling potential and anti-tumor activity in vivo. We constructed two unique genetically engineered mouse models, which can model a spectrum of OED/HNC lesions with high-fidelity histologic and immunophenotypic resemblance to human diseases, to recapitulate 3q26.3-driven OED transformation. We also identified unique collections of case-control and longitudinal paired OED/HNC specimens, which allow us to validate key findings on the temporal shift of exploitable immune targets with clinical specimens. The overarching goal of this translational program is to test the hypothesis that 3q26.3 amplification is a key early high-risk event that leads to OED immune escape and that a combination of metabolic remodeling agent with immunotherapy effectively prevents OED progression. Thus, this proposal is fully responsive to the RFA-CA-19-014 and is focused on the deeper understanding of the time-course of immune landscape shift as pre-malignant lesions progress, using 3q26.3 amplification-driven OEDs as a high-risk disease model. We will qualify a novel metabolic remodeling drug-like molecule as a priming agent to maximally improve immuno-prevention. The 3q26.3 amplification is not unique to HNC and commonly found in squamous cell carcinomas of the lung, esophagus and skin, hence, our findings will help address a broad class of public health concerns.",2019-09-24T12:09:00Z,2024-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-19-014,nofo_RFA-CA-19-014,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,ANN ARBOR,MI,UNITED STATES,iotn

U10CA180830,NCI NCTN- Network Lead Academic Participating Site: USC,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center first participated in the research activities of SWOG in 1987 and was initially funded in 1992. This five-year grant cycle has had increased administrative and academic participation, with maintenance of high clinical and correlative trial entry, commensurate with available SWOG funding and added resources from USC. The major emphases of the USC team are (a) to provide leadership across the NTCN to design and efficiently perform clinical trials evaluating the safety and efficacy of novel regimens or modifications of existing regimens; (b) to provide leadership in biomarker development and in integration of new technologies into NCTN trials, taking advantage of a systematic approach to collection, processing, and storage of blood, normal tissue, fresh or frozen tumor tissue, and other relevant biologic samples for molecular and pharmacologic studies; and (c) to evaluate cancer treatment regimens in special patient populations, such as rare cancers, the elderly and ethnic minorities. USC investigators have not only contributed extensively to SWOG trials but have demonstrated administrative/academic leadership, facilitating the translation of specific themes of investigation to SWOG.

U24CA055727,Childhood Cancer Survivorship Study,"ABSTRACT The Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS) is a multi-institutional, multi-disciplinary collaborative research resource established to systematically evaluate long-term outcomes among children diagnosed with cancer who survived five or more years from diagnosis. With the successful recruitment and longitudinal follow-up of the cohort that includes survivors diagnosed and treated over three decades (1970-1999), the CCSS is the world's largest established open resource for survivorship research with 38,036 eligible survivors available for investigation of late mortality, and 25,665 participants who have contributed health-related and quality of life outcomes. The resource includes comprehensive annotation of treatment exposures, ongoing longitudinal follow-up and an established biorepository from which genotype (SNP array) and DNA sequencing of 8,380 survivors are available to investigators for identification of genetic susceptibility for disease- and treatment- related late effects. Extensive use by the research community has resulted in: 381 published or in press manuscripts now cited over 26,500 times; 347 presented abstracts; 59 investigator-initiated grants funded, totaling $67 million in funding; utilization by a diverse group of 1,225 investigators including 91 early career trainees; conduct of 11 randomized trials; increased knowledge to inform exposure-based clinical care guidelines; and a highly successful model for multiple national and international collaborative initiatives of pediatric cancer survivorship research. During the next five years, activities will ensure the functioning of CCSS as a strong and productive resource by maintaining, enhancing and promoting its use. We will expand the collection of data to evaluate physiologic and neurocognitive function with aging, characterize accelerated aging, and investigate underlying pathophysiology of aging of survivors as they enter into their fourth, fifth and sixth decades of life. To develop a population resource for intervention trials targeting age-related outcomes, in-home functional performance assessment and specimen collection will be performed in a sub-cohort of 1000 survivors. Further, we will enhance the CCSS resource by facilitating the conduct of health services research through collection of data to evaluate patient, provider, and health care system factors and their associations with access, quality, and cost of care. To maximize the research community's access and use of the CCSS resource, we will leverage a cloud-based data sharing platform and develop a data analysis ecosystem with tools for data access, visualization and analysis of genetic, treatment and phenotypic/outcome data. In the future, assessment of late outcomes of novel therapies (immunotherapy, targeted/biologic, proton beam radiation) will be essential. Therefore, with NCI oversight, CCSS will formulate a comprehensive plan for future expansion. These initiatives will enhance and promote CCSS to further achieve the overarching goal of the CCSS resource to increase the conduct of innovative and high impact research related to pediatric cancer survivorship.",1993-07-20T12:07:00Z,2026-11-30T12:11:00Z,RFA-CA-15-502;RFA-CA-20-052,nofo_RFA-CA-20-052,ST.

U24CA082102,The Chernobyl Tissue Bank - Coordinating Center,"The Chernobyl Tissue Bank -Coordinating Center Abstract The Chernobyl Tissue Bank was established in 1998 to collect, annotate and store biological samples from patients who were exposed in childhood and adolescence to radioiodine in fallout from the Chernobyl accident, and who subsequently have developed thyroid cancer. The bank currently contains material from 4500 patients, and all material is consented for use in research, including genomics. Biological samples are further processed and made available to scientists worldwide for research on the molecular mechanisms underlying development of thyroid cancer. The CTB also facilitates collection of samples for NCI funded epidemiological cohorts studies such as the Ukraine- American cohort. Sample collection is prospective and the CTB now contains a control population, resident in the same geographical areas, who have developed young onset thyroid cancer in the absence of radioiodine exposure, thus facilitating research into identifying biomarkers of radiation in an age- matched cohort. An estimated thyroid dose for each exposed individual is also provided by the CTB. The current application is for continued collection of samples in Ukraine, addition of further clinical data on treatment and outcome and further collation of research data. Recent research in adult thyroid cancer has suggested that addition of biomarkers to clinical annotation provides better risk stratification for patients. The CTB is the largest collection of samples from young onset thyroid cancer and is therefore ideally placed for studies into the role of biomarkers in risk stratification for young onset thyroid cancer. To facilitate this, the CTB is also in the process of collating data from research studies that have used material from the resource. This will enable initial in silico studies to be conducted to identify potential risk stratification biomarkers for validation in further studies. The funds sought in this application are to support the continuation and further development of this unique infrastructure. Elements of the infrastructure have potential for use in other large-scale tissue banking initiatives for cancer research.",2000-07-17T12:07:00Z,2022-07-31T12:07:00Z,RFA-CA-12-501;RFA-CA-16-502,nofo_CA16-502,"IMPERIAL COLLEGE OF SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY AND MEDICINE",LONDON,,UNITED KINGDOM,the_chernobyl_tissue_bank_coordinating_center

Of these five, our BRL led the development of serum OVA1 for ovarian cancer, serum proPSA (phi) for prostate cancer, and served as the reference lab for the urine PCA3 study for prostate cancer. In fact, OVA1 which is based on our original multiplex proteomic study published in Cancer Research, was the first proteomic IVDMIA ever cleared by the FDA for clinical use. In addition, three leading diagnostics/biotechnology companies have agreed to collaborate with us in our product development proposal. In this renewal, we plan to continue our strong commitment to the EDRN mission through network collaborations, and provide leadership in biomarker validation, technology/assay improvement, and product development. With this multi-disciplinary team of scientists, the BRL at Johns Hopkins offers the best opportunity for the success of cancer biomarker validation and translation into the clinic for the early detection of cancer.",2005-06-20T12:06:00Z,2023-03-31T12:03:00Z,RFA-CA-14-016,nofo_CA-14-016,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,BALTIMORE,MD,UNITED STATES,edrn
U24CA163056,Barrett's Esophagus Translational Research Network Coordinating Center (BETRNetCC),"PROJECT SUMMARY Although esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is a relatively uncommon cancer, the incidence of this disease has increased rapidly in recent decades; moreover, at the time of detection of EA, most patients have very poor prognosis. The alarming increase in EA over the past several decades, along with the poor prognosis for those affected, demand investigation into the risk factors for this disease, improved management of patients at risk, and development of preventive measures. Advances in these areas will have significant public health benefit in terms of reducing morbidity and mortality for those affected, as well as reducing the public health costs associated with managing EA at advanced stages. To better manage patients at risk for EA will require an improved understanding of the mechanisms of neoplastic progression in the esophagus. Such progression involves the development of Barrett's esophagus, a premalignant lesion in which the normal stratified squamous epithelium of the distal esophagus is replaced by columnar epithelium, visible as an abnormality on endoscopy, and confirmed on biopsy as specialized columnar epithelium with intestinal metaplasia. For these reasons, the NCI has developed the Barrett's Esophagus Translational Research Network (BETRNet), a consortium research initiative with the goal of reducing the incidence, morbidity, and mortality of EAC, through answering key questions related to the progression of this disease, especially in the premalignant stage of BE, the only precursor lesion definitively associated with EA. In this application we describe the accomplishments to date, as well as the vision forward, for the BETRNet Coordinating Center (BETRNet-CC), with the following critical functions: • Administrative and logistical support for the BETRNet program, including efficient communications and coordination of efforts to connect available resources, serve as a data management center, and integrate activities of the research centers; • Coordination of cross-network research through leadership and management of diverse teams, as well as providing logistical and administrative support to the governing body of the BETRNet (the Steering Committee); and • Ongoing development, maintenance, and administration of the BETRNet patient registry with virtual biorepository (BETRNet PR-VB).",2011-09-21T12:09:00Z,2023-02-28T12:02:00Z,RFA-CA-16-007,nofo_RFA-CA-16-007,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,NASHVILLE,TN,UNITED STATES,betrnet
U24CA180922,Trinity: Transcriptome assembly for genetic and functional analysis of cancer,"RNA-Seq studies indicate that the cancer transcriptome are shaped by genetic changes, variation in gene transcription, mRNA processing, editing and stability, and the cancer microbiome. Deciphering this variation and understanding its implications on tumorigenesis requires sophisticated computational analyses, and being able to tackle analyses of bulk RNA-Seq as well as transcriptomes of individual tumor cells. Most RNA-Seq analyses rely on methods that first map short reads to a reference genome, and then compare them to annotated transcripts or assemble them. However, this strategy can be limited when the cancer genome is substantially different than the reference or for detecting sequences from the cancer microbiome. `Assembly first' (de novo) methods that combine reads into transcripts without any mapping are a compelling alternative. The assembled transcriptome can then be used to identify mutations, fusion transcripts, splicing patterns, expression levels, tumor-associated microbes, and – if collected from single cells – characterize tumor heterogeneity. There is thus an enormous need for computationally efficient, accurate and user friendly tools for transcriptome reconstruction and analysis in cancer. Trinity, first released in mid-2011 and freely available as Open Source, is the leading software for de novo RNA-Seq assembly, executed millions of times by thousands of rsearchers, over 4k literature citations, and now includes a host of modules for downstream analyses, contributed by the Trinity development team or contributed by 3rd party developers. Here, we will continue to enhance and maintain Trinity and further develop our Trinity Cancer Transcriptome Analysis Tookit (CTAT) as leading tool suite for bulk and single-cell cancer transcriptomics. We will tailor analytic modules for critical tasks in cancer biology, working with a network of cancer researchers on Driving Cancer Projects (Aim 1). We will continue to update the Trinity software to enhance the core algorithm, leveraging new sequencing technologies and integrating genome data with genome-free assembly (Aim 2). We will integrate Trinity CTAT into the NCI cloud computing platform via FireCloud for scalable cancer transcriptome data processing and analyses (Aim 3). We will grow the Trinity cancer user community, using online and in person training and support (Aim 4), to allow any cancer researcher to leverage it in diverse modalities.",2013-09-17T12:09:00Z,2024-08-31T12:08:00Z,PAR-15-331,nofo_PAR15-331,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",CAMBRIDGE,MA,UNITED STATES,itcr
U24CA180996,Cancer Genomics: Integrative and Scalable Solutions in R/Bioconductor,"Abstract Bioconductor is an ecosystem of more than 1,500 open-source software and data packages for the statistical analysis and comprehension of high-throughput genomic data. It is widely used by the cancer genomics research community for statistical analysis and visualization. This software ecosystem is supported by core data classes and methods, reused by both users and developers, that provide convenient representations and efficient operations for many kinds of high-throughput molecular data. Falling sequencing costs and single-cell assays enable increasingly resolved study of the molecular biology of cancer, through combined assaying of DNA sequence, epigenetics, gene expression, protein, and other aspects, even at the single-cell level, for a single specimen. These developments present new challenges in complexity, size, and interpretability of the data. The overarching goal of this project is to create and adapt core Bioconductor software infrastructure to meet these challenges, through the following aims. First, we develop infrastructure for the analysis of single-cell multi-omic experiments. Second, we implement FAIR principles for improved somatic variant prioritization, by defining performant data architecture that harmonizes and integrates the large amount of experimental and annotation data available through Bioconductor. Users of our system will be able to create provenance-rich interoperable reports on structural and functional contexts of somatic variants for use in prioritization. Third, we develop scalable infrastructure for the curation, distribution, maintenance, discoverability, and usability of cancer data resources within and externally to Bioconductor. Finally, we develop a program of user training and new outreach approaches to support adoption of advanced Bioconductor infrastructure by developers of new cancer-related packages and existing packages critical to the cancer research community.",2014-09-01T12:09:00Z,2024-08-31T12:08:00Z,PAR-15-331,nofo_PAR15-331,GRADUATE SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH POLICY,NEW YORK,NY,UNITED STATES,itcr
U24CA184427,NDEx - the Network Data Exchange A Network Commons for Biologists,"Summary Knowledge of the hallmark networks of cancer has been key to interpreting the molecular heterogeneity seen within and across tumors. NDEx, the Network Data Exchange (www.ndexbio.org), is an online commons where scientists can upload, share, and publicly distribute molecular networks and pathway models. We are currently two years into a three-year grant from the National Cancer Institute (U24 CA184427A), during which time we have created the NDEx open-source platform; released NDEx as a public website; and begun to link NDEx to applications such as Cytoscape. Having built this initial system, our goals for the next funding period are to rapidly develop NDEx network content and communities and the means by which these resources impact cancer research and treatment. In particular, we will (1) Connect NDEx networks to next-generation cancer genome analysis; (2) Enable the direct publishing of interactive networks on journal websites; (3) Develop hallmark cancer pathway content via social organization and automation; and (4) Scale the NDEx framework to support a growing community of users and analysis tools. Through these aims, the emphasis of the NDEx Project transitions from core infrastructure to genome analysis workflows, cancer-relevant network content, publishing, and community building. These developments address a strong and immediate need in cancer research for a cyberinfrastructure that can analyze genome-scale information in the context of molecular networks.",2014-05-01T12:05:00Z,2023-04-30T12:04:00Z,PAR-15-331,nofo_PAR15-331,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",LA JOLLA,CA,UNITED STATES,itcr
U24CA195858,Stanford and Northrop Grumman proposal for the Oncology Models Forum,"﻿ DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The mission for the Oncology Models Forum (OMF) is to align, harness and integrate data and knowledge of cancer mouse models to drive more rapid success in the discovery of diagnostics, therapeutics, and models of disease in cancer. In early June 2014, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) released PAR-14-239 describing the OMF as a ""comprehensive resource for information to guide generating, validating, and credentialing new models, informing their practical uses, advancing modeling technologies, [and] providing catalogs of available models resources, programs, and services."" To maximize the use of available resources, this online site was prescribed to use HUBzero, an existing open-source scientific website framework, avoiding the expensive creation of a new scientific website from scratch. The OMF was designed as a community-building tool, with online discussion forums and an annual meeting. Specific content will be provided from the collaborative R01s funded in parallel to the OMF. Pre-clinical mouse and human-in-mouse models are critical to future translation in cancer. More than 4,300 manuscripts were published in 2013 describing or using cancer mouse models, including xenografts and transplantation models, spontaneous models, inbred mice, and genetically engineered mouse models (GEMM). The NCI Cancer Models Database (caMOD) now lists thousands of mouse models that are prone to develop tumors in one or more sites. But data on these models is scattered across numerous resources. Future success in research using cancer mouse models is now less dependent on the continued creation of new models, and more dependent on the validation of the thousands of currently available models, transparent access to knowledge and data on these models, comparisons of model data with human data, and organization of the research community. We plan to develop the Oncology Models Forum (OMF) to accomplish these goals. Our proposed OMF will integrate structured and unstructured data and knowledge on cancer mouse models, enabling new discoveries and the development of new translational tools.",2015-09-01T12:09:00Z,2021-08-31T12:08:00Z,PAR-14-239,nofo_PAR14-239,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",SAN FRANCISCO,CA,UNITED STATES,omf
U24CA204800,Scalable Clinical Decision Support for Individualized Cancer Risk Management,"Project Summary / Abstract We propose to enable a scalable clinical decision support (CDS) platform that helps clinicians and patients select cancer screening strategies that are best suited to each individual. This kind of CDS is important because increased evidence supports personalizing cancer screening decisions according to each individual's unique cancer risks. While a highly desired goal, individualizing screening at a population scale requires the implementation of patient-specific risk assessments for several types of cancer. This is quite challenging in today's overwhelmed primary care environment. Our proposed CDS platform addresses this challenge by (i) automating the risk stratification process at the population level based on EHR data and patient reported data; (ii) prioritizing patients for case review by genetic counselors; and (iii) automatically communicating risk and screening recommendations with primary care providers and their patients. We will integrate the CDS platform with the Epic EHR and test it at the University of Utah Health Care community clinics and the Huntsman Cancer Institute. We will assess the generalizability of the CDS platform with a different EHR (Cerner) at a different institution (Intermountain Healthcare). To maximize the dissemination potential for the proposed cancer risk screening platform, we will extend two well-established open source CDS platforms: OpenCDS and OpenInfobutton. These platforms are reference implementations of international EHR standards that are required for EHR certification in the US. We will also obtain software certification from the Open Source EHR Alliance, share the CDS platform and our experiences with other awardees in the ITCR Program, present the CDS platform at national and international cancer and informatics conferences; and engage with relevant stakeholders through a technical expert panel. Any healthcare organization with a certified EHR will be able to use the proposed CDS platform. Therefore, if successful, this proposal can have a significant impact on disseminating individualized cancer screening practices according to the best available evidence.",2017-08-01T12:08:00Z,2022-12-31T12:12:00Z,PAR-15-331,nofo_PAR15-331,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,SALT LAKE CITY,UT,UNITED STATES,itcr
U24CA204863,Advanced Development and Dissemination of EMERSE for Cancer Phenotyping from Medical Records,"PROJECT SUMMARY The increasing use of electronic health records (EHRs) by cancer centers nationwide has led to the tremendous growth of repositories containing unstructured, free text notes. These notes include clinical concepts that cannot be found anywhere else in the EHR, and these concepts are needed to characterize a patient’s specific ‘phenotype’. Having so much data available in electronic format provides unprecedented opportunities for advancing clinical and translational cancer research, yet many researchers do not have access to practical tools to assist with identifying and extracting the concepts from these notes. To address this problem, the University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center Informatics Core developed the information retrieval tool EMERSE—electronic medical record search engine—which has achieved widespread local success in supporting hundreds of cancer studies and has led to over 120 peer-reviewed publications. EMERSE provides innovative features that enable research including visualization of results, reusable patient lists, and shareable sets of search terms (“Bundles”) that promote more reproducible searches. This project proposes to develop innovative capabilities within EMERSE and develop the infrastructure to widely disseminate EMERSE to cancer centers nationwide. The software innovations in this proposal include (1) securely networking the EMERSE instances to enable searches across cancer centers, which is important for rare cancers and is in alignment with growing national data sharing initiatives; (2) leveraging the networked EMERSE instances to share search knowledge between institutions in the form of stored search term Bundles, promoting the reproducibility of searches across sites as well as within studies; (3) supporting search with either fully identified or de-identified clinical notes, depending on the users’ credentials and intended use, which is needed for cross-institutional searching; (4) supporting the inclusion of localized custom dictionaries or ontologies to be used for query expansion. The technical and collaborative infrastructure to support the widespread dissemination of EMERSE will be developed, including formation of the EMERSE Research Informatics Network (ERIN). Five cancer centers, each with varying health information technology environments, will join ERIN for this project and locally implement EMERSE, making it available to their researchers. Implementations will be staggered so that lessons learned from implementing at one site can be used to improve the documentation and be applied to future sites. Implementation details will include how to address regulatory, institutional review board, security, and compliance issues. The collective knowledge from these initial implementers will be integrated into a ‘roadmap’ guide to help future cancer centers and other institutions implement EMERSE with ease. EMERSE will be promoted to other cancer centers through various mechanisms. The impact and effectiveness of this work will be evaluated across multiple dimensions including information retrieval metrics, usability, implementation, adoption, satisfaction, and utility.",2017-08-17T12:08:00Z,2023-07-31T12:07:00Z,PAR-15-331,nofo_PAR15-331,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,ANN ARBOR,MI,UNITED STATES,itcr
U24CA209837,Washington University Co-Clinical Imaging Research Resource,"ABSTRACT Breast cancer (BC) is the most common cancer diagnosed in women. Approximately 70% of BCs are estrogen receptor (ER) positive (ER+) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative (HER2-). Endocrine therapy (ET) reduces recurrence risk and improves survival for many in this group. However, despite standard of care and adjuvant ET, over 20% patients with ER+/HER2- BC experience metastatic recurrence in the years to come, and virtually all patients with metastatic disease eventually experience disease progression on ET due to intrinsic or acquired resistance mechanisms. There are currently no biomarkers that reliably identify which of these advanced breast cancer patients will benefit from ET-based approaches so that chemotherapy could be avoided or delayed. To address this unmet need, the objective of this proposal is to develop co-clinical quantitative PET/CT imaging strategies integrated genoproteomic discovery to predict response to ET in patients with ER+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer (MBC). To that end, we will interface with a recently awarded phase II multicenter Translational Breast Cancer Research Consortium (TBCRC) trial to assess the functional status of estrogen receptor in patients with ER+/HER2- MBC. The U24 will have three specific aims: in Aim 1 we will optimize animal modeling and the quantitative accuracy of PET imaging agents of response to ET in ER+/HER2- BC patient-derived tumor xenografts (PDX). In Aim 2 we will implement optimal quantitative methods to predict response to ET in ER+/HER2- and integrate with multi-scale genoproteomic data across the co-clinical trial. And in Aim 3 we will populate content from the co-clinical investigation on a web-accessible research resource and expand capabilities of co-clinical database (CCDB). In addition, high value multi-scale analytic data will be generated, including whole exome sequencing (WES), RNASeq, pathology, and CODetection by indEXing (CODEX) to characterize tumor heterogeneity. All data will be uploaded to an informatics resource available to the co-clinical community to test new algorithms and mine for novel leads integrating imaging and multi-scale analytic data to predict therapeutic response. Overall, this proposal aims to have a far-reaching and high impact on the implementation of precision medicine in identifying, stratifying, and predicting response to ET+CDK4/6i in patients with ER+/HER2- MBC, integrating quantitative imaging with genoproteomic discovery.",2017-03-17T12:03:00Z,2027-07-31T12:07:00Z,PAR-15-266;PAR-18-841,nofo_PAR-18-841,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,SAINT LOUIS,MO,UNITED STATES,cirp
U24CA209851,TCPA: an Integrated Bioinformatics Resource for Functional Cancer Proteomic Data,"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Reverse-phase protein arrays (RPPAs) offer a powerful functional proteomic approach to investigate molecular mechanisms and response to therapy in cancer. MD Anderson Cancer Center has been a leader in the implementation of this antibody-based technology that can assess many protein markers across large numbers of samples in a cost-effective, sensitive and high-throughput manner. The platform currently assesses ~300 protein markers, covering all major signaling pathways and most drug targets. Its utility was demonstrated through its selection as the sole platform for characterizing >10,000 patient samples through The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA); and recently it has been designated as one of two NCI Genome Characterization Centers, and will characterize up to ~10,000 samples from ongoing NCI initiatives and other consortium projects. For TCGA project, the applicants built The Cancer Proteome Atlas (TCPA), a web platform for visualizing and analyzing RPPA data, which has a community of >5,000 users worldwide. The long-term goal is to promote the ability of functional proteomics to impact cancer research and the development of relevant therapeutic strategies. The current objective is to expand the scope of TCPA by adding new functionalities and datasets, and to enhance and improve its existing analytic capabilities. Working relationships have been formed to link TCPA with other widely used bioinformatic resources (e.g., cBio, UCSC Genome Browsers, Firehose and Synpase) and other ITCR projects. An experienced, multidisciplinary team has been assembled to pursue four specific aims: Aim #1. Develop an open source, all-in-one software package for processing RPPA data. This effort will standardize each informatic step for RPPA data generation including experimental design, quality control, and data normalization. The resultant program will be exported to other RPPA facilities. Aim #2. Expand and enhance our existing web platform for the analysis of patient-cohort RPPA data. The web platform will cover other patient cohorts, incorporate other types of molecular/clinical data, and provide pathway/network-based analytics. Aim #3. Build a user-friendly, interactive, open web platform for the analysis of cell line RPPA data. This effort will collect and compile RPPA data of >1,500 cell lines, and develop a web platform parallel to Aim #2. Aim #4. Promote TCPA and active interaction with the user community. This effort will provide documentation, hands-on workshops, and bug fixes, and build web APIs for interaction with other tools. The expected outcome is the first, dedicated bioinformatic resource that fully integrates RPPA data generation, analysis and user feedback, allowing for fluent exploration and analysis of high-quality proteomic data in a rich context. The project is important because it will greatly enhance the quality and reproducibility of RPPA data from important consortium projects; substantially reduce barriers biomedical researchers face in mining complex functional proteomic data; serve as a hub for integrating proteomic data into other widely used bioinformatic resources; and directly facilitate development of protein markers for precision cancer medicine.",2016-09-01T12:09:00Z,2022-08-31T12:08:00Z,PAR-15-331,nofo_PAR15-331,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,HOUSTON,TX,UNITED STATES,itcr

U24CA209996,Building protected data sharing networks to advance cancer risk assessment and treatment,"Project Summary Advances in genomics and data analytics create new opportunities for accurate risk prediction and personalized medical treatment for even rare cancers via large-scale data federation across institutions. Yet cancer research is often stymied by a lack of appropriate tools to streamline the transfer and sharing of clinical patient data for cancer research. Globus services permit secure data transfer, synchronization, and sharing in distributed environments at large scale. We propose here to extend these services so that they are appropriate to work securely with protected human data. The extended services will allow federation of clinical patient data for accurate cancer risk prediction, personalized treatment, as well as any other cancer research area. Globus is widely used, with over 15,000 users, more than 8,000 storage systems accessible via Globus, including at most leading US universities and many sites overseas, and more than 165 petabytes and 25 billion files transferred. Adoption of Globus by biomedical researchers has been rapid and is accelerating. Biomedical researchers at ~30 universities, government agencies, and sequencing centers have relied on Globus for streamlined data transfer and sharing. Our “Globus Genomics” (GG) integrated Galaxy-Globus-cloud genomics analysis system has been used by more than 300 researchers across multiple biomedical research domains, including cancer, at over 25 institutions to analyze over 10,000 samples. We will develop a HIPAA Enablement Toolkit that will enable Globus and other software-as-a-service providers (including GG) to manage protected data securely (Aim 1.1). We will extend Globus security features by implementing file name encryption and by encrypting data with user-supplied keys, and demonstrate that these new features can be used by GG and other services to enable elastic, secure, high-performance cancer genomics data analysis (Aim 1.2). We will integrate Globus with major cloud platforms by developing uniform storage system interfaces (Aim 2.1), engineering high-speed transfers (Aim 2.2), and implementing search, replication, and synchronization (Aim 2.3) on AWS, Google, Microsoft, and OpenStack-based clouds, so that cancer researchers can transfer and share data securely and easily among these and other (e.g., local) computing and storage platforms. The resulting tools will be applicable to any cancer type across the cancer research spectrum. We will validate and disseminate these new technologies first within existing and emerging breast (Aim 3.1), blood (Aim 3.2), and pancreatic (Aim 3.3) cancer research networks and then more broadly with collaborators across the cancer research continuum (Aim 3.4). We will work closely with collaborators and users to ensure that we meet the needs of a broad cross-section of the cancer research community that requires transfer, sharing, and analysis of large, human data sets. We will use extensive community outreach through multiple channels to widely disseminate our technologies.",2017-08-01T12:08:00Z,2022-07-31T12:07:00Z,PAR-15-331,nofo_PAR15-331,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,CHICAGO,IL,UNITED STATES,itcr
U24CA209999,Monitoring tumor subclonal heterogeneity over time and space,"PROJECT SUMMARY DNA sequencing and new computational approaches have yielded detailed maps of clonal variation in human cancer. While changes in clonal structure over time and under the selective pressure of treatment have been extensively studied in hematologic malignancies, solid cancers are less well characterized owing to the relative lack of suitable tumor material. Analyses of breast and ovarian cancer have demonstrated substantial clonal variation between metastatic sites and polyclonal heterogeneity within individual tumor deposits, yet our understanding of the dynamics of clonal change in breast and ovarian cancer and its role in therapeutic response and the emergence of resistance is in its infancy. By combining expertise in mutation detection and genomic analysis with access to unique patient cohorts, this proposal will develop critically needed methods to identify all genomic changes in tumors in order to resolve a tumor's clonal substructure as it evolves over time or space in response to treatment. We will apply our tools in two key patient cohorts: 1) longitudinal samples from early stage, neoadjuvant breast cancer patients biopsied before, during, and after the completion of initial chemotherapy; and 2) tumor cells from metastatic breast and ovarian cancer patients at multiple time-points during their treatment with multiple courses of chemotherapy (breast and ovarian) and at time of autopsy (ovarian). The Specific Aims are to: (1) Develop and apply comprehensive mutation detection to identify the genetic lesions that develop in patient tumors over time during the course of chemotherapy, or at multiple distinct metastatic lesions. Using these tools, we will measure the cellular prevalence of mutations among multiple biopsies from both breast and ovarian patient cohorts. (2) Comprehensively prioritize mutations based on the likelihood that they drive tumor evolution. We will use these methods to prioritize consequential mutations and to gain insight into the potential mechanisms underlying clonal evolution. (3) Delineate tumor subclone structure and its evolution across longitudinal tumor biopsies and multiple metastatic lesions. By estimating the cellular prevalence of all forms of mutation in each biopsy, these innovations will enable a better understanding of how tumor subclone populations evolve over time and space and evade response to chemotherapy. (4) Create an interactive, web-based software platform for the analysis exploration of tumor subclone structure. In summary, the proposed research will devise and apply new algorithms that will improve our understanding of the dynamics of breast and ovarian cancer evolution over time and space.",2016-09-01T12:09:00Z,2022-08-31T12:08:00Z,PAR-15-331,nofo_PAR15-331,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,SALT LAKE CITY,UT,UNITED STATES,itcr
U24CA210004,The Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV): visualization supporting cancer research,"Project Summary/Abstract Driven by new and emerging technologies for data acquisition, integrative genomic studies are revolutionizing the way we approach the study of cancer and other diseases, and charting the way to novel treatment regimens. They require the high-throughput generation and analysis of multiple, and often complex, types of genomic data. To address this challenge, and in active collaboration with end users, we developed a broadly applicable Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV). IGV is a high-performance, user-friendly tool used by over 100,000 investigators and clinicians worldwide for the interactive exploration of large, integrated genomic datasets. The goal of this project is to ensure that IGV continues to track and respond to advances in genomics technology and changing user needs, and maintains its high level of utility for the cancer research community. We will accomplish this through our three specific aims as described below. Aim 1. To ensure that the IGV continues to keep pace with new and emerging technologies and the changing cancer research environment we will develop new and improved IGV views of, e.g., long range genomic events, physical proximity data, and more. In recognition of the biomedical community's increasing use of the cloud, we will ensure efficient and accessible visualization of cloud data and seamless integration with analysis workflows. An IGV Advisory Board will ensure we are best tracking technologies and user needs. Aim 2. To enhance, refine, and maintain IGV to best support cancer researchers in their work we will develop new features and updates based on feedback and suggestions from the IGV user community. We will also take advantage of external resources that are valuable for cancer research, as well as development in support of other projects that use IGV in their own applications and resources. Special attention will be paid to collaborations and initiatives within the Informatics Technology for Cancer Research (ITCR) family of tools. Aim 3. To provide training, support, and outreach activities for the cancer research community we will continue to provide our email help desk, workshops and documentation to help both the user and developer communities take best advantage of IGV. Importantly, we will develop a new collection of focused IGV “sketches” to walk users through visualization tasks with high utility. We have extensive experience in software engineering, including the development and distribution of IGV and other software tools used by hundreds of thousands of biomedical researchers and clinicians worldwide. We will continue our user-driven development approach working closely with large genomics projects like The Cancer Genome Atlas, NCI supported software projects like the Cancer Genomics Cloud Pilots and the ITCR program, as well as numerous single-investigator studies. IGV's current success, flexible architecture, and our plan to support external development make us well poised to accomplish our aims to further transform data visualization and accelerate the pace of biomedical discovery.",2016-09-01T12:09:00Z,2022-08-31T12:08:00Z,PAR-15-333,nofo_PAR15-333,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",LA JOLLA,CA,UNITED STATES,itcr
U24CA210949,"Batch effects in molecular profiling data on cancers: detection, quantitation, interpretation, and correction","Abstract: Technical batch effects pose a fundamental challenge to quality control and reproducibility of even single-laboratory research projects, but the possibilities for serious error are greatly magnified in complex, multi-institutional enterprises such as the cancer molecular profiling projects being undertaken by the NCI Center for Cancer Genomics (CCG). To aid in detection, quantitation, interpretation, and (when appropriate) correction for technical batch effects in such data, we have developed the MBatch computational tool and web portal. MBatch has become indispensible for quality-control “surveillance” of data in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project, but detecting and quantitating batch effects (or trend effects or statistical outliers) are just the first steps in a process. The next steps involve detective work in collaboration with those who generated the data, drawing upon expertise in integrative analysis across data types, pathways, and systems-level biology. That detective work usually succeeds in diagnosing the cause of a batch effect as technical or biological. If technical, then computational correction can be done (judiciously). The primary aim of the proposed Genome Data Analysis Center (GDAC) is to translate that successful quality-control model from TCGA to other current and future large-scale molecular profiling projects sponsored by the CCG. We will be ready to do that on Day 1. The second aim is to increase the power of MBatch to perform the basic quality-control functions. We will add a number of innovative new algorithms (Replicates- Based Normalization, Empirical Bayes++, and CorNet) and increase the repertoire of standard methods. We will also add major visualization resources including our interactive Next-Generation Clustered Heat Maps. The third aim is to make the system sufficiently robust, user-friendly, interactive, carefully documented, and easy to install that bench biologists and clinical researchers can use it to explore CCG-generated data or their own. Toward those ends, we have established collaborations to implement MBatch in Galaxy and on the cloud. We bring a number of assets to the proposed GDAC, including (i) multidisciplinary expertise in bioinformatics, biostatistics, software engineering, biology, and clinical oncology; PIs with a combined 21 years of experience in high-throughput molecular profiling studies of clinical cancers (in a highly consortial context); international leadership in batch effects analysis; a highly professional software engineering team with a track record of producing high-end, highly visual bioinformatics packages and websites; a team of 20 Analysts whose expertise can be called on; extensive computing resources, including one of the most powerful academically- based machines in the world; strong institutional support; close working relationships with first-class basic, translational, and clinical researchers throughout MD Anderson, one of the foremost cancer centers in the country. The bottom-line mission of the GDAC will be aid the research community's effort to understand cancer and to prevent, detect, diagnose, and treat it more effectively for the benefit of patients and their families.",2016-09-13T12:09:00Z,2021-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-15-020,nofo_RFA-CA-15-020,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,HOUSTON,TX,UNITED STATES,gdan
U24CA210950,Integrated analysis of protein expression data from the Reverse Phase Protein Array (RPPA) platform,"Project Summary/Abstract The National Cancer Institute has initiated, or will initiate, a number of large-scale cancer genomics programs under the aegis of the Center for Cancer Genomics (CCG). The overall goal of those programs is to help elucidate the mechanisms of cancer initiation, evolution, and resistance to therapy through detailed molecular characterization of tumor samples across multiple technological platforms. As most therapy targets are proteins, and protein phosphorylation is functionally important, accurate analysis of protein is critical to the effort. Consequently, MD Anderson was awarded the Genome Characterization Center contract to develop and apply a high-throughput reverse-phase protein array (RPPA) pipeline (Contact PD/PI Gordon Mills; PD/PI Rehan Akbani). The present proposal is for the establishment of a Specialized Genome Data Analysis Center (GDAC) at MD Anderson under the same auspices. As its first objective, the GDAC will directly support CCG projects by analyzing RPPA data for the Analysis Working Groups (AWGs). The GDAC will participate in discussions, solicit feedback from the AWGs, and suggest future directions for research. A second objective of the GDAC will be to enhance its current bioinformatic tools to improve the analysis and interpretation of RPPA data, whether developed under the aegis of the CCG or through other community approaches. Specifically, the aims of the GDAC are to (i) Extract high-quality, analysis-ready protein expression measures from the RPPA data; (ii) Cluster RPPA data and conduct integrated analysis by correlating RPPA data with clinical and other molecular data; (iii) Perform knowledge-based and independent pathway analysis of RPPA data to identify proteomic pathways that have been substantially altered in the set of cases in each CCG project; and (iv) Continue to develop innovative bioinformatic and computational tools and methodologies to improve the RPPA data analysis pipeline. The pipeline will be shared publicly for the benefit of other researchers. The GDAC will perform the stated tasks by continuing to develop a fully or semi-automated software pipeline using the Galaxy software infrastructure and their own software modules. A preliminary version of the pipeline, together with the necessary expertise for systems biological interpretation of the results, is already in place and will be available at the beginning of the performance period. Further enhancements of the pipeline will be implemented as the GDAC progresses. The pipeline will input raw or pre-processed RPPA data from a central data repository that is specified by the CCG; perform quality control; remove any batch effects; analyze the data using novel plus traditional algorithms; correlate the data with other molecular/clinical features; visualize the outcome; and then deposit the results back in the repository for use by the AWG. The GDAC will interact and collaborate with other components of the CCG consortium to discover biologically and clinically relevant findings that will shed light on the underlying mechanisms of cancer and offer potential avenues for novel therapeutic approaches.",2016-09-13T12:09:00Z,2021-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-15-020,nofo_RFA-CA-15-020,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,HOUSTON,TX,UNITED STATES,gdan
U24CA210952,Integrative miRNA data analysis for clinical cancer genomics,"PROJECT SUMMARY The proposed research has two broad, long-term objectives. First, it seeks to shift medical practice toward more personalized treatments, by applying innovative methods to analyze and integrate DNA, RNA and protein data generated by a large network of GDAN researchers in a miRNA-centric framework. Analyses will identify cancer subtypes, and individual patients within a subtype, in which alterations in the expression of certain miRNAs influence cancer pathogenesis and drug response. Second, the proposed research seeks to shift cancer genomics research by allowing a diverse group of cancer researchers to flexibly access and use the project’s cancer genomics data, and microRNA-centric results and methods, through a cloud computing framework. The proposed research has three specific aims: 1) Build a computational pipeline for processing and analysis of miRNA data, 2) Elucidate the regulation of and by miRNAs through integrative analysis, and 3) Delineate the role of miRNAs in cancer progression and treatment using predictive modeling. Research design and methods: 1) Processing and analysis of miRNA data. We will process total RNA sequence data to identify expressed miRNAs, and extend the current processing pipeline to identify potentially functional miRNA sequence variants. We will apply our miRNA-centric analyses developed for The Cancer Genome Atlas project to identify: subtypes within a cancer, miRNAs that are associated with survival, miRNA targeting effects on gene and protein expression, and cis-effects of copy number and DNA methylation on miRNA abundances. 2) Regulation of and by miRNAs. Collaborating within the research network, we will extend our analysis methods to take into account additional datatypes and functional contexts that influence how miRNAs are regulated, and how they regulate genes and their products. 3) Predictive modeling. As the research network will have detailed clinical data and multiplatform genomic data, we will apply machine learning algorithms in a novel context to key sets of genes, proteins and miRNAs that predict clinical outcomes like survival and drug response. 4) Cloud computing. We will make our data, analysis methods and results readily available to a broad group of researchers within a cloud computing framework.",2016-09-14T12:09:00Z,2022-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-15-020,nofo_RFA-CA-15-020,PROVINCIAL HEALTH SERVICES AUTHORITY,VANCOUVER,BC,CANADA,gdan
U24CA210954,"iPGDAC, An Integrative Proteogenomic Data Analysis Center for CPTAC","Project Summary Proteogenomic characterization of human tumors seeks to explain how complex genomic alterations drive the hallmarks of cancer through mass spectrometry based proteomic analysis. The field has been accelerated by the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) who performed proteomic analyses for breast, colorectal and ovarian tumors and integrated the data with genomic information provided by the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Our Vanderbilt team conducted the colorectal cancer study and published the first paper on proteogenomic characterization of human cancer in the journal Nature. Data analysis approaches pioneered by us also were used in the CPTAC breast and ovarian cancer studies. Results from all three studies successfully demonstrated the value of integrative proteogenomic analyses in achieving a more complete understanding of cancer biology. Based on this proof of concept, the new CPTAC program seeks to expand the proteogenomic approach to more cancer types and to diverse types of samples including pre- and post-treatment clinical specimens, cultured cells, and patient-derived xenografts (PDXs). This application proposes an integrative proteogenomic data analysis center (iPGDAC) built on our established expertise and resources. The overarching goal of the iPGDAC is to analyze data generated by CPTAC and related resources to better understand cancer biology and to improve cancer treatment. To comprehensively exploit all CPTAC data, we propose three tiers of data analysis. Tier 1 analyses will integrate proteomic and genomic data generated from individual studies. These analyses will identify variant peptides and proteins as candidate biomarkers or therapeutic targets, will predict patient prognosis and response to therapy based on multi-omics data, and will reveal mechanisms of drug action and acquired drug resistance to drive rational drug combinations. Tier 2 analyses will integrate data between preclinical models and human tumors to enable effective translation of experimental findings to the clinic. Tier 3 analyses will integrate data across different cancer types to identify common and cancer type-specific protein signatures and networks. We will make our computational tools and analysis results publically available in two integrated proteogenomic data analysis systems, which will facilitate the collaborative identification of candidate biomarkers by all CPTAC investigators and will broaden the impact of the CPTAC program. The iPGDAC brings to the CPTAC network a fully integrated, completely established program with expertise in all the critical areas specified by the RFA. We have a proven track record of leadership in computational proteogenomics and successful collaboration in the CPTAC network, and we expect to broadly advance the field through this project.",2016-09-20T12:09:00Z,2023-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-15-023,nofo_RFA-CA-15-023,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,HOUSTON,TX,UNITED STATES,cptac
U24CA210955,PNNL Proteome Characterization Center,"PROJECT SUMMARY The overall objective of the PNNL Proteome Characterization Center (PCC) is to integrate genomic information with proteomic technologies to comprehensively characterize the proteome and post-translational modifications (PTMs) as well as the functional interaction of proteins in signaling networks in cancers. As one of the PCCs in the current Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) program, PNNL successfully applied advanced proteomics capabilities and expertise to the comprehensive proteogenomic and phosphoproteomic characterization of ovarian high-grade serous carcinomas from The Cancer Genome Atlas, and has developed novel mass spectrometric approaches to facilitate the analysis of intact proteins, low stoichiometry PTMs, and extremely small samples. The planned PNNL PCC will build on these achievements and contribute to the success of the CPTAC network by characterizing multiple new tumor types assigned by CPTAC, using both the proven standardized, multiplexed discovery and targeted confirmatory workflows as well as introducing novel technologies and platforms, as appropriate, to improve proteomic measurements. Both human biospecimens and preclinical models provided by NCI will be analyzed. The Discovery Research Arm will comprehensively characterize the proteome and multiple PTM-omes in human biospecimens and preclinical samples of 2-3 cancers with the validated advanced proteomics platforms, integrated workflows and informatics tools, using highly multiplexed isobaric labeling and state-of- the-art liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry instrumentation at a throughput of up to 300 samples per year. The Confirmatory Research Arm will verify the impact of genomic variation on the changes in proteome and PTM-omes with validated targeted proteomics platforms (e.g., multiple reaction monitoring), peptide standards and quality assurance. Up to 100 highly specific, multiplexed targeted proteomics assays for both proteins and PTMs will be developed each year for the confirmatory studies using up to 150 samples per year. We will also refine and validate several developmental strategies and platforms at the PNNL PCC leveraging our on-going technology development in areas such as ultrafast gas phase separations and small- sized sample analysis platforms and methodologies to further improve the throughput and sensitivity in both the discovery and confirmatory studies. The PNNL PCC will work closely with the other PCCs, Proteogenomic Data Analysis Centers and Proteogenomic Translational Research Centers in the CPTAC network on data integration and bioinformatics analysis, as well as translational applications.",2016-09-21T12:09:00Z,2022-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-15-021,nofo_RFA-CA-15-021,BATTELLE PACIFIC NORTHWEST LABORATORIES,RICHLAND,WA,UNITED STATES,cptac
U24CA210957,OHSU Center for Specialized Data Analysis as part of the GDAN,"Project Summary Recent advances in therapeutics have improved survival rates for many cancers. However, nearly all metastatic tumors are incurable, and resistance to therapeutic interventions is nearly universal. There are many reasons for our lack of progress-foremost of which is lack of understanding of mechanisms of response and resistance and lack of markers to identify subsets of patients ideally-suited for specific treatments. Our team brings enormous experience in TCGA and other multi-disciplinary coordinated projects, such as BEAT-AML, and the Stand Up to Cancer West Coast Prostate Cancer Dream Team. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) was successful because multi-disciplinary teams worked together to create new and innovative knowledge about cancer and we intend to ensure that the GDAN is equally successful. In this application, we have assembled a team of proven investigators from four of the different TCGA groups to extend the successes of TCGA to the projects managed by the Center for Cancer Genomics. Our team will continue our outstanding capabilities at analyzing and interpreting cancer genomic data by deploying data analysis pipelines that support the key capabilities of the network. In addition to the our experience in coordinated network studies, we bring experience with clinical trial design and interpretation. Further, the team has deep expertise at building the computational infrastructure necessary for the GDAN to succeed. For example, in the domain of distributed computing we have deploy pipelines for execution at many sites. We also bring novel methods for integrative pathways and analysis. Finally, we bring our experiences with competitive challenges that ensure that we can identify and deploy the most effective methods for genomic data analyses. Using these strengths we will support the GDAN and the Analysis Working Groups (AWGs) that it serves with two principal objectives. The first objective and second objective, per the RFA, are the “Development of innovative bioinformatics and computational tools and methodologies”, which will allow us to make clinical and biological correlations and to “Conduct Integrative analysis of data sets generated by GCCs using the bioinformatics tools developed by each GDAC.” We will achieve these objectives in five specific aims, one administrative aim to support the GDAN and four aims, one for each of the areas where we propose a competency.",2016-09-13T12:09:00Z,2021-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-15-020,nofo_RFA-CA-15-020,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,PORTLAND,OR,UNITED STATES,gdan
U24CA210967,University of Michigan Proteogenomics Data Analysis Center,"ABSTRACT This is an application to establish the University of Michigan Proteogenomic Data Analysis Center (UM- PGDAC). The National Cancer Institute (NCI) has made significant investments in new technology platforms for cancer proteomics through the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) initiative. Proteomics provides complementary information not apparent from the analysis of genomic and transcriptomic data alone. First, it is critical to identify which of the thousands of novel or previously poorly characterized transcripts or sequence variants discovered using genomic and transcriptomic approaches are expressed at the protein level, prioritizing such variants for subsequent validation studies. Second, integration of quantitative information across multiple data types has emerged as a powerful strategy for reconstructing targetable pathways in cancer and for nomination of potential drug targets. At the same time, sophisticated, integrative analyses across genome and proteome data require advanced bioinformatics tools and stringent quality control measures. UM-PGDAC is uniquely positioned to implement advanced bioinformatics infrastructure to address these challenges and apply it across CPTAC data. It brings together a multi-disciplinary team of scientists who are leading experts in the areas of computational proteomics, transcriptomics, genomics, cancer systems biology and precision oncology. The team is anchored at the Michigan Center for Translational Pathology (MCTP), which has a long history of successful collaborations between the individual investigators. UM-PGDAC builds upon more than a decade of highly relevant work that resulted in the development of a comprehensive infrastructure required for proteogenomics and multi- omics data integration research. UM-PGDAC investigators will work to further improve the speed and accuracy of proteogenomics analyses. The integrated genome/transcriptome/proteome pipelines used by the UM-PDGAC will be enhanced with automated data visualization capabilities and report generation tools for presenting the findings to cancer biologists in a transparent and easy to interpret manner. UM-PGDAC will work collaboratively with other members of the CPTAC to ensure minimal duplication of efforts, efficient exchange of data and bioinformatics methods and tools and interoperability via the use of common file formats and data standards. Building upon its extensive experience in the area of biomarker discovery and precision oncology, further enhanced through participation of UM-PGDAC investigators in the EDRN, SPORE, and other NIH funded initiatives, UM-PGDAC will engage in a second round of prioritization work to select candidate cancer-specific proteins and peptides for subsequent targeted validation using multiplex proteomic assays. Finally, UM-PGDAC will take advantage of a unique opportunity – in the form of the NCI funded T32 Proteome Informatics Training Program at the University of Michigan – to create a unique environment for training the new generation of cancer researchers versed in proteomics technology.",2016-09-15T12:09:00Z,2022-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-15-023,nofo_RFA-CA-15-023,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,ANN ARBOR,MI,UNITED STATES,cptac
U24CA210969,Integrative Cancer Epigenomic Data Analysis Center (ICE-DAC),"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The past three decades have witnessed an accumulating body of evidence that epigenetic mechanisms play an instrumental role in human cancer. Epigenetic alterations can serve as driver events in cancer by inactivating tumor-suppressor genes. The finding that these silencing events are mutually exclusive with structural or mutational inactivation of the same gene reinforces the functional significance of epigenetic silencing. The majority of cases of microsatellite instability in sporadic human tumors can be attributed to epigenetic silencing of the MLH1 mismatch repair gene. One of the most striking discoveries to emerge from cancer genome projects has been the previously unappreciated preponderance of somatic mutations in epigenetic regulators in most types of human cancer. Clearly, epigenetic mechanisms play a key role in human cancer, and a comprehensive molecular characterization of cancer should include epigenomic profiling. We propose to create an Integrative Cancer Epigenomic Data Analysis Center (ICE-DAC) to provide specialized analysis pipelines and expertise as part of the Genome Data Analysis Network (GDAN). We anticipate that epigenomic data will be provided as bisulfite-based sequence data or as DNA methylation BeadArray data, and we provide an analysis workflow that can accommodate either. We propose to apply specialized epigenetic analyses we have developed for both data types in our extensive experience in cancer genome consortia. In Specific Aim 1, we will develop, improve and implement analytic bioinformatic tools for epigenomic data analysis, including improvements to analysis tools for processing bisulfite sequence data. We will continue the development of analysis tools that use DNA methylation data to analyze tumor heterogeneity and subclonal structure, including the deconstruction of non-malignant cellular composition of the tumor. In Specific Aim 2, we will provide advanced specialized analysis of cancer epigenomic data generated by the Genome Characterization Center and/or provided through the Data Processing GDAC. Our automated workflow will provide timely primary data analysis for AWGs, and can accommodate both sequence-based or array-based DNA methylation data. This workflow will call differentially methylated regions (DMRs), identify cancer subtypes through stratified cluster analysis, analyze CpH methylation, and analyze tumor purity and subclonal heterogeneity. Performing variant analysis from bisulfite sequence data allows us to determine the impact of non-coding mutations on epigenetic state. In Specific Aim 3, we will integrate epigenomic data with other genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and clinical data to derive biologically and clinically relevant novel insights. Integration of DNA methylation and RNA-Seq data will be used for epigenetic silencing calls and for our custom enhancer identification ELMER pipeline, both of which will feed into pathway and network analyses.",2016-09-15T12:09:00Z,2021-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-15-020,nofo_RFA-CA-15-020,VAN ANDEL RESEARCH INSTITUTE,GRAND RAPIDS,MI,UNITED STATES,gdan

It is, however, not clear what is the best way to integrate these data sets to extract as much information as possible about the biology that drives the cancer and how to best disrupt the tumor growth. Our proposed Proteogenomic Data Analysis Center for Cancer Systems Biology and Clinical Translation will develop new methods for better analyzing and integrating these data sets. In addition to developing statistical and machine learning methods, we also emphasize visual exploration of the data, and we will implement interactive web browser based visualization that will allow researchers to easily explore these vast data sets and gain novel insights by being able to quickly switch between summary information and details of the raw data.",2016-09-15T12:09:00Z,2022-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-15-023,nofo_RFA-CA-15-023,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,NEW YORK,NY,UNITED STATES,cptac
U24CA210974,Visualization hub for genomics data exploration and translational discovery,"Project Summary/Abstract Large NCI clinical trials and research projects have been generating data on cancer genomes at an unprecedented rate, elucidating the mechanisms of cancer initiation and evolution, as well as resistance to therapy. To fully utilize this comprehensive data resource, which has exceeded a petabyte (1015 bytes) of data, the scientific community needs deep, user-friendly interactive computer visualizations of the data. These will empower investigators to discover the molecular processes driving each patient's cancer, and to identify potential translations of this knowledge into new therapies, ultimately advancing both our knowledge of cancer mechanisms and patient outcomes. We propose to develop a web-based Data Hub and Viz Hub platform to allow researchers to visualize the richness of the NCI's cancer genomics data from a single web interface. Visualizations will be composed of a set of “bio-centric” views developed by the bioinformatics community and made available in BioJS, an open- source repository of tools to represent biological data. This will establish a new paradigm of web-based biological data visualization development by way of sharable and reusable modular open source components. To initiate the Viz Hub platform, we will integrate seven popular 3rd-party bioinformatics visualizations into the existing UCSC Xena Browser utilizing a plug-and-play framework. We will then work closely with several clinical labs to develop two new translational visualizations for the next generation of genomic medicine. One will be a Longitudinal Omics Integrator, giving researchers a highlighted overview of a patient while drilling down into genomic and functional data collected throughout treatment. Another will help researchers investigate responses to various new types of immunotherapy, which promise to revolutionize cancer treatment. This Immuno-Tracker and Immunoediting Viewer will show how immunogenic neoantigens, T-cell receptors, and B-cell receptors change over disease progression and in response to treatment. The visualization needs of the scientific community, NCI's Genomic Data Analysis Network, and Disease Working groups will be fully supported through our system of public and restricted Data Hubs. Our high- performance Data Hubs will be easy to install on a diverse range of computing environments. Users will be able to integrate public and restricted data, from large consortia and individual researchers (including their own labs), seamlessly on our web-based Viz Hub. Our commitment to bioinformatics community standards, such as GA4GH and BioJS, ensures that our contributions will be interoperable. Our designs will be vetted by users through testing in tumor boards and at designated booths at international cancer meetings. This will ensure that our platform will effectively serve researchers, biologists and clinicians now and into the future of precision medicine.",2016-09-13T12:09:00Z,2022-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-15-019,nofo_RFA-CA-15-019,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA CRUZ,SANTA CRUZ,CA,UNITED STATES,gdan
U24CA210978,Center for the comprehensive analysis of somatic copy-number alterations in cancer,"Abstract Somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs) are a type of mutation in cancer that affect more of the cancer genome than any other genetic event. SCNAs often contribute to cancer development and progression, and detecting them can contribute to the development of diagnostic and therapeutic advances in clinical care. As part of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project our group characterized SCNAs for over 10,000 tumors across 30 different tumor types. Through these efforts we developed state-of-the-art methods to detect and interpret SCNAs, and used these to discover SCNAs that recur across many tumors and likely contribute to the formation of these tumors, the candidate tumor suppressors and oncogenes these SCNAs target, and novel clinically relevant SCNA-based cancer subtypes. We have also developed methods to detect SCNAs and the rearrangements that bound them from high-throughput sequencing data of the type being collected by the Genomics Data Analysis Network (GDAN). These methods resolve SCNAs, the mechanisms by which they arise, and their potential biological consequences, in much greater detail than could be done with microarray data generated for TCGA. Leveraging our experience in SCNA analysis, we propose to establish a Genomics Data Analysis Center (GDAC) that will service the GDAN with comprehensive, advanced analyses of SCNAs and the rearrangements that bound them, with the goals of identifying biologically and clinically relevant patterns of SCNA and disseminating this information to the GDAN and wider research community. We will: 1) Generate basic and quality control information for each tumor. We determine the fraction of cancer cells within each tumor (tumor purity) and the average copy number genomewide (ploidy). We will also test every putative pair of tumor and normal DNA samples to ensure that they did originate in the same person. 2) Characterize SCNAs and rearrangements in each tumor, including clonal and subclonal amplifications, deletions, loss of heterozygosity, and complex events like chromothripsis, firestorms, and isochromosomes. 3) Identify recurrent SCNAs and rearrangements that are likely to drive tumor development and progression, and the oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes they likely target. 4) Classify tumors by previously identified SCNA subtypes and discover new subtypes. We will identify SCNAs and genomewide patterns of SCNA that correlate with clinical and molecular features of tumors. 5) Integrate with the GDAN and research community. We will integrate our analytic pipelines with those of other GDACs; immerse ourselves in cooperative Analysis Working Groups formed by the GDAN to refine those analyses in light of the most important questions; make our analysis results available to other members of the GDAN in real time; and disseminate those results to the wider research community through our existing web portal and by working closely with other GDACs to integrate our analyses into their web portals. Our results will inform how SCNAs cause cancer and indicate new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.",2016-09-15T12:09:00Z,2021-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-15-020,nofo_RFA-CA-15-020,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",CAMBRIDGE,MA,UNITED STATES,gdan
U24CA210979,Integrated high throughput proteogenomic data analysis center for CPTAC,"Project Summary Mass-spectrometry (MS) based proteomics is increasingly being used in conjunction with genome profiling and next-generation sequencing (NGS) for large-scale characterization of cancer samples including cell lines, patient-derived xenografts and tumor material. Publications from the NCI-CPTAC program and others have highlighted the utility of proteogenomic analysis in elucidating cancer biology and identifying aberrant proteins and signaling networks in cancer. But, a high throughput pipeline implementing a range of analyses for transforming genomic and proteomic data into information easily accessible to scientists is still lacking. We propose an integrated high throughput proteogenomic data analysis center (PGDAC) to address this immediate need. The PGDAC will exploit Firehose—a platform developed by our group that has set the standard for genome and NGS data analysis—to implement a flexible, robust, automated and reproducible proteogenomic data analysis pipeline and visualization portal. This cloud-based near-real-time platform will not only include a robust version of the pipeline created for recently completed proteogenomic studies from our group, but will also incorporate new tools and algorithms, especially for the analysis and visualization of phosphoproteomic data. The result will be an automated, version-controlled pipeline that provides an integrated view of clinical, genomic (CNA, mRNA, RNA-seq, mutation) and proteomic (global proteome, phosphoproteome, and other PTM) data, with analyses ranging from correlations, clustering, marker identification and pathway enrichment. The FireBrowse graphical user inferface, combined with other visualization tools, will provide a familiar, accessible and intuitive interactive user interface for non-computational scientists. Analysis results and reports will be hosted on local web portal, in addition to being uploaded to the DCC. The proteogenomic data analysis pipeline will be used for biomarker selection and enable therapeutic target identification using disease-specific and pan-cancer cohorts, and quantify changes to cellular signaling networks due to site-specific post-translational modifications and genetic aberrations.",2016-09-15T12:09:00Z,2022-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-15-023,nofo_RFA-CA-15-023,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",CAMBRIDGE,MA,UNITED STATES,cptac
U24CA210985,The Comprehensive Proteome Characterization Center at Johns Hopkins: High Precision Discovery and Confirmation of Genoproteomic Targets,"As one of the five current CPTAC PCCs, we propose to leverage our established center to further our research in the comprehensive characterization of biospecimens from human and preclinical models for additional cancer types. We have assembled an outstanding team of basic and clinical scientists to discover and confirm proteins and protein modifications associated with cancer progression using genoproteomic approaches. This multidisciplinary team will be managed by the same three Principal Investigators (PI) and consists of internationally recognized experts in proteomic technologies, genomics, proteogenomics-specific bioinformatics, biostatistics, oncology, pathology, cancer biology, assay development, quality control, technology optimization, and clinical laboratory science/clinical chemistry. Our team has complementary and integrated expertise with previous and ongoing successful collaborations. The plan is to integrate the genomics findings with proteomic analysis (genoproteomics) and to overcome the caveats and challenges in the comprehensive understanding of tumor biology. We believe that genomic data provides a highly valuable molecular route towards the identification of genes and pathways that could be useful for the detection, differential diagnosis, outcome prediction and therapeutic targets of cancer. The proteomic approaches will provide the identification of unique features that are inherent to proteins including post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation and phosphorylation. We propose to use the technology platform validated during the current CPTAC which is high throughput, robust and state of the art. These technologies are proven, with the capability of generating reproducible results across labs. We will use a two-step strategy to characterize defined sets of genomically-characterized samples. The first step is the discovery of target proteins from both biological and clinical specimens using mass spectrometry and affinity based technologies. The second step is the confirmation of these targets using high-throughput, CPTAC Tier 2 analytically validated targeted assays, for example, Multiple Reaction Monitoring Mass Spectrometry (MRM-MS). In addition, we propose to develop pilot studies for technology improvement. The goal is to generate accurate, reproducible, sensitive, quantitative, and multiplexed assays using optimized and standardized high-throughput technologies for the discovered targets. While this PCC application is focused on the proteomic characterization of biological and clinical specimens, we believe that the understanding of and expertise in proteogenomic data analysis and translation will be critical for the success of the PCC and the overall CPTAC network. Investigators/PIs from our proposed PCC will be part of applications for the CPTAC Proteogenomic Data Analysis (PGDAC) and Translational Research (PTCR) Centers.

U24CA210986,Center of Excellence for High Throughput Proteogenomic Characterization,"Project Summary (Carr, Mertins) Genetic alterations in human cancer have been systematically mapped by genomics landscape studies in the past decade, however, the direct consequences of these alterations on the functional proteome are poorly understood. Deep scale, mass spectrometry-based proteomic studies of three tumor types in the current phase of the Clinical Proteomics Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) program have revealed that integration of proteomic data with genomic data can improve specificity for identifying cancer-relevant pathways triggered by somatic DNA variants or DNA copy number alterations (CNAs) compared to genomic characterization alone, and help narrow target selection for potential therapeutic intervention. Here we propose to extend proteogenomic characterization to additional genetically defined tumor types – lung, brain and pancreatic cancer – and preclinical patient-derived tumor xenografts and cell line models. State-of-the-art LC-MS/MS proteomics technology with highly multiplexed stable- isotope mass tagging (TMT 10-plex) will be employed for precise relative quantification of the proteome, phosphoproteome and acetylome with very deep coverage. Improved multiplexing capabilities in these discovery type analyses enable a throughput of over 500 samples per year in conjunction with longitudinal quality control performance measurements. The proteome data produced will be integrated with genomics data in collaboration with the CPTAC Proteogenomics Data Analysis Centers. The goal will be to identify proteins with somatic variants or cancer-specific splice site junctions, correlate effects between copy number alterations and protein expression, and to identify signaling pathways in the phosphoproteome and lysine-acetylome that are activated by genetic alterations. This proteogenomics approach will inform target selection for confirmatory targeted mass spectrometry assays with a particular emphasis on mutated proteins, oncogenic regulators/effectors, and druggable proteins. We will develop and deploy new and existing analytically validated, highly multiplexed targeted MS- based assays (MRM and PRM) to measure cancer-relevant proteins and modified peptides in human biospecimens for candidate verification. Stable isotope-labeled peptides will be used as internal standards for unambiguous identification and quantification at a multiplex level of up to 200 analytes per assay. Existing technology will be further developed to enable comprehensive analysis of rare tumor cell populations, to evaluate tumor heterogeneity, to increase depth and breadth of post-translational modification analysis, and to improve depth, reliability and repeatability of peptide i.d. and quantification in general by intelligent data acquisition.",2016-09-14T12:09:00Z,2021-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-15-021,nofo_RFA-CA-15-021,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",CAMBRIDGE,MA,UNITED STATES,cptac
U24CA210988,RNA sequencing analysis of Cancer,"Abstract Cancer is a complex disease and represents hundreds of different disease types. It is important to identify these disease types and their underlying causative alterations to help guide and tailor treatments. Genomic technologies have been used in projects such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to characterize a large number of cancers. However, these early genomics projects were mostly on unselected cohorts with limited follow-up and many clinically relevant datasets were not feasible for analysis due to limitations in technologies using formalin-fixed and small starting quantities of tissue. New initiatives of the Center for Cancer Genomics will help us address more clinically-meaningful questions. We propose to use our expertise in gene expression and RNA-sequencing analysis to further characterize cancer to help identify novel markers for diagnosis, novel drug therapies and clinical associations. We will approach this in three aims. For Aim 1, we will use RNA sequence information to identify somatic mutations, improve mapping assembly and quantification of B and T cells, identify structural variations, and perform high level quality control including genotype checks across sequence data for the same sample. For Aim 2, we will calculate gene and isoform levels that will be used to identify tumor subtypes, alternative isoform usage, and application of previously defined gene signatures and tumor subtypes. For Aim 3, we will use supervised analyses to find genes significantly associated with molecular features and model gene expression data to look for association with clinical outcome or drug treatment response. We expect our data, integrated with the data from other Genome Data Analysis Centers, will uncover novel insights into cancer development, progression and treatment of cancer. We will also leverage the information we have learned from pan-cancer analyses to identify shared genomic alterations or pathway activity that may accelerate therapy development.",2016-09-15T12:09:00Z,2021-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-15-020,nofo_RFA-CA-15-020,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,CHAPEL HILL,NC,UNITED STATES,gdan
U24CA210989,The joint WCM-NYGC Center for Functional and Clinical Interpretation of Tumor Profiles,"The Weill Cornell Medicine-New York Genome Center (WCM-NYGC) for Functional and Clinical Interpretation of Tumor Profiles will perform integrative analyses of coding and non-coding variants to detect and unravel the function of specific classes of mutations and assess their clinical potential. As specified in the RFA, we have chosen to focus on two Core Competencies: (1) coding mutations and (2) non-coding mutations (germline). We will use WCM’s expertise in clinical genomics demonstrated by the first CLIA approved Whole Exome Sequencing test in New York State. We will leverage NYGC’s computational infrastructure with > 5,000 cores and 10Pb storage and data management expertise. We will focus our GDAC on specific classes of mutations: (1) coding mutations and their clinical relevance including relevance to immunotherapy; (2) driver non-coding point mutations and their role in transcriptional regulation; (3) the driving role of structural variations. In Aim 1 we will annotate the clinical and functional impact of coding mutations including immunotherapy. First we will generate a clinical grade report containing clinical interpretation of mutations, viewable through a custom user interface. This will enable detailed statistics on number and frequency of clinically relevant variants. A new module will help contribute new variants to the knowledge base and community. Second, we will apply our analytical pipeline for unraveling the immune landscape together with a novel integrative immunoscore that predicts which patients are more likely to respond to immune checkpoint blockade, a therapy showing dramatic impact in a subset of cancer patients. In Aim 2, we will annotate the driving role and impact of non-coding mutations on splicing. First, we will functionally characterize genetic variants outside of genes (promoters, enhancers) using the experimentally validated FunSeq pipeline. Second, we will analyze the transcriptional consequence of splice site alterations using a novel for integrating RNA-Seq data with predicted splice-altering variants from DNA sequencing. In Aim 3 we will annotate the driving role and transcriptional impact of structural variations. We will annotate structural variants and gene fusions using a consensus-based approach with methods benchmarked in our group as well as novel methods. The output of this Aim will be comprehensive annotation and functional analysis of a critical class of non-coding events. In summary, the proposed analyses rely on existing pipelines and tools that will be used in a standard and automated way on the WCM-NYGC computational infrastructure. The objective of these analyses is to derive novel knowledge and correlation that will impact both clinical and research cancer genomics fields.

U24CA210990,UCSC-Buck Specialized Genomic Data Analysis Center for the Genomic Data Analysis Network,"The “UCSC-Buck Genome Data Analysis Center for the Genomic Data Analysis Network” will develop state-of-the-art methods for integrating various types of data to discover the genetic pathways, the microenvironment, the originating cells, and the oncogenic processes driving the initiation and progression of tumors. The long term goals of the project are to identify highly accurate models detailing the faulty genetic circuitry at work in each subclone of a patient’s tumor, as well as any “normal” cells acting as accomplices by supporting the cancer microenvironment. The ultimate objective is to encode computer algorithms that can search a patient’s individual pathway diagram for the best combination of interventions to eliminate every tumor cell, while preserving the health of every normal cell, in their body. Integrative pathway analysis methods will be developed to reveal signatures of tumor subtypes from Pan-Cancer and external datasets. New technologies will be established for uncovering network models tailored to individual patients. The tools will be deployed as part of an active collaboration to support the specific projects of the Genome Data Analysis Network. Novel probabilistic graphical models will be used to infer disrupted signaling. Cellular signatures will be collected from the analysis of normal cells, cancer cell line models, and Pan-Cancer investigations. Novel machine-learning methods, guided by pathway mechanisms, will be established to identify cell state signatures in heterogeneous patient samples. This work will reveal rare mutations driving metastatic transformation that are currently of unknown significance. New clues about the genetic circuitry promoting response and resistance to treatment will be established.

U24CA210993,Systems Biology based Proteogenomic Translator for Cancer Marker Discovery towards Precision Medicine,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The goal of our PGDAC is to improve understanding of the proteogenomic complexity of tumors. Towards this goal, our First Aim is to apply network based system learning to reveal causative molecular regulatory relationships contributing to varieties of phenotypes in cancer using CPTAC proteomic/genomic data. We will start with a mixed effects model to (1) fix the batch effects in data from multi-plex proteomics experiments; and (2) handle the large amount of missing data from abundance-dependent missing mechanisms in proteomic data (Aim 1.1). We will then utilize a multivariate penalized regression framework to construct the global regulatory networks between genomic alterations (such as DNA mutations, CNA, methylations), and protein as well as their PTM (post translational modification) abundances (Aim 1.2). Such regulatory networks help to elucidate how protein or pathway activities are shaped by genomic alterations in tumor cells. We will also construct protein co-expression networks based on global-, phosphor-, glyco- and other PTM-proteomics data (Aim 1.3). When constructing these networks, we will use advanced computational tools to effectively borrow information from literatures, databases, and transcriptome profiles. In addition, we will model tumor and normal tissues jointly, so that tumor specific interactions and network modules will be inferred with better accuracy. Both Aims 1.2 and 1.3 will lead to a big collection of network modules, as well as functionally related protein sets (e.g. proteins regulated by the same genomic alteration). These network modules and protein sets will then be tested for their associations with disease phenotypes (Aim 1.4). In the end, we will derive a more integrated view of commonalities and differences across multiple tumor types via a Pan-cancer analysis (Aim 1.5). Our Second Aim is to further develop methods, software, and web-tools to optimize the data analysis in our PGDAC. We will develop novel statistical/computational tools tailored to CPTAC proteomics data; implement these methods as computationally efficient software; and construct an integrated data analysis pipeline (Aim 2.1). We also plan to develop a set of web service tools for visualization and biological annotation of protein networks and clinical interpretation of proteomic data (Aim 2.2). Our Third Aim is to nominate novel protein-based cancer biomarkers and drug targets for further investigation by targeted proteomics assays. We will first utilize a prediction based scoring system to identify protein biomarkers that predict altered cancer pathways, network modules and individual oncogenes; disease outcome and drug resistance; and therapeutically distinct disease subtypes (Aim 3.1) We will then utilize network based tools to identify driver players in selected proteins signature sets (Aim 3.2). These driver proteins could play important roles in shaping the overall function of regulatory system, and thus serve as good candidates for cancer biomarkers and drug targets. We will also take into consideration of domain knowledge of different diseases, as well as technique constrains for developing targeted proteomics assays in biomarker selection. !",2016-09-19T12:09:00Z,2021-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-15-023,nofo_RFA-CA-15-023,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,NEW YORK,NY,UNITED STATES,cptac
U24CA210999,Global Infrastructure for Collaborative High-throughput  Cancer Genomics Analysis,"Abstract The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) set the standards for large-scale cancer genome projects worldwide. In the next phase, the National Cancer Institute and its Center for Cancer Genomics are planning large-scale projects closely tied to clinical questions and trials. In order to perform the analysis of these data, the NCI is creating a Genome Data Analysis Network (GDAN) of different types of Genome Data Analysis Centers (GDACs). Central to this Network is a single Processing GDAC, which will take all the harmonized data, as stored in the NCI's Genomics Data Commons, and perform higher level integrated analyses on these data to support both the Analysis Working Groups (AWGs) within the Network (which will be formed for each project to perform special analyses of the data and write manuscripts) as well as the entire biomedical research community. Herein we propose to build the centralized Processing GDAC on top of our FireCloud platform, an infrastructure to run large scale computation on the cloud in a fully rigorous and reproducible fashion. FireCloud development was based on our experience with Firehose, the Broad internal platform on which the standard TCGA data and analyses currently run. We propose to create and operate the GDAN Standard Workflow, incorporating tools actively developed and used within the GDAN and across the entire field, with particular emphasis on clinical tools. This Workflow will serve as the starting point for AWGs and set the highest standards of transparency, reproducibility and rigor for cancer genome analysis. The results of the Standard Workflow will be stored in a public database, and accessible via standard APIs, and used together with a continuously updated database of prior knowledge to create scientific reports that will be made available to the community, in a pre-publication manner. Finally, a major innovation is that AWG members will be able to login into FireCloud and rerun the entire workflow, or parts of it, with their own parameters and subsets of the data – thus making the entire GDAN analysis fully reproducible and scalable. Our goals are therefore: (1) To create a global infrastructure for collaborative extreme- scale cancer analysis; (2) Operate the Standard Workflows at scale; (3) Rapidly and continuously evolve the Standard Workflows; and (4) created improved capabilities for reporting, exploring the results, clinical diagnostics and reproducibility.",2016-09-20T12:09:00Z,2022-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-15-018,nofo_RFA-CA-15-018,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",CAMBRIDGE,MA,UNITED STATES,gdan
U24CA211000,Pathway and Network Integration of Cancer Genomics and Clinical Data,"PROJECT SUMMARY Cancer genomics projects have successfully cataloged many of the frequent genomic, epigenetic, and gene expression alterations that drive cancer progression. However, these initial projects have also demonstrated that both the types and targets of genomic aberrations are incredibly heterogeneous, reflecting the large diversity of perturbations in the cellular machinery that promote tumor growth and metastasis. As cancer sequencing efforts expand to determine the molecular basis of additional phenotypes such as drug resistance or exceptional responders, novel methods to integrate data from multiple genomic characterization platforms across combinations of alterations in pathways and interaction networks are essential. We propose to build a Genome Data Analysis Center (GDAC) focused on pathway analysis. Our GDAC will integrate data from multiple genome characterization platforms, and use several computational approaches to identify combinations of genomic aberrations and downstream expression changes that distinguish clinical phenotypes. We will employ algorithms that utilize information about known pathways and/or biological interaction networks, as well as other approaches that analyze statistical patterns of mutual exclusivity and co-occurrence between alterations and clinical variables. We will combine the discovered pathways with knowledge of drugs and their targets to identify novel interventions in individual patients. Finally, we will augment the computational analyses with a web platform for interactive visualization and annotation of discovered pathways. This human-in-the-loop system will accelerate the annotation of mutations, pathways, and interventions and provide a dynamic ecosystem linking cancer genomics datasets to new and existing literature. By combining rigorous computational and statistical approaches with human-in-the-loop annotation, the proposed GDAC will facilitate the translation of multi-platform genome characterization data to clinical application.",2016-09-15T12:09:00Z,2021-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-15-020,nofo_RFA-CA-15-020,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,Princeton,NJ,UNITED STATES,gdan
U24CA211006,Deep Discovery and Clinical Interpretation of Germline and Somatic Cancer Drivers,"PROJECT SUMMARY Large-scale cancer sequencing efforts provide a unique opportunity for the discovery of germline and somatic driver alterations influencing cancer susceptibility, initiation, progression, and clinical response. Detecting such alterations is fundamentally and technically challenging for several reasons including: 1) the combinatorially enormous number of ways that a genome can be altered, 2) the presence of various sized repeats, highly homologous gene families, and other contextual influences on alignment and detection accuracy, 3) systematic errors inherent in current sequencing technologies and tumor preservation techniques, and 4) intratumoral and intertumoral heterogeneity including clonality, purity, and lymphocyte infiltration. As a result, the full complement of driver events for the typical tumor still defies identification and, in many cases, no drivers can be found. Our recent work has also demonstrated that some types of indels/SVs such as complex indels, ITD/PTD (internal/partial tandem duplications), and homopolymer indels are often missed by existing approaches. Beyond detection challenges, functional interpretation of the impact of genomic alterations requires strategies that integrate WGS/exome, RNA-seq, and protein data to reveal translational, splicing, and protein structural effects. In addition, cooperative dynamics between germline and somatic alterations are usually missed, as these events have been analyzed independently. As cancer sequencing projects expand to include well-curated clinical phenotypes, methods necessary to understand the pathogenicity and druggability of driver alterations that underlie phenotypes such as drug resistance or exceptional responders are also urgently needed. To fully harness the power of large-scale cancer genomics and to facilitate advances in personalized medicine, our group proposes to focus on two core competencies, coding and non-coding mutations, outlined in the RFA. In collaboration with other GDACs, GDC, and AWGs, we will extend computational approaches that we have successfully established and applied for TCGA and ICGC projects to detect and functionally and clinically interpret germline and somatic drivers using sequencing data from GCC along with curated clinical data.",2016-09-14T12:09:00Z,2021-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-15-020,nofo_RFA-CA-15-020,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,SAINT LOUIS,MO,UNITED STATES,gdan
U24CA213274,Coordinating center for the NCI small cell lung cancer research consortium,"ABSTRACT The overarching goal of the NCI Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC) Coordinating Center has been to “break the logjam” of fundamental knowledge gaps resulting in a 30+ year lack of progress on this lethal malignancy that was designated a “recalcitrant cancer” by the US Congress and NCI. Our U24 Coordinating Center has done this by promoting and facilitating information sharing, interaction, and collaborative research among NCI- supported investigators studying SCLC. Over our initial five years of support, this Coordinating Center has significantly increased research progress within the SCLC research community through efforts including, but not limited to, the creation and ongoing expansion of comprehensive preclinical and clinical -omics databases, centralized annotation and cataloging of available SCLC models, distribution and sharing of such models, centralized data analytics, a centralized Consortium website, initiation and coordination of an interactive work- in-progress (“WIPs”) forum as well as planning and oversight of annual meetings. Of all of this, the role of the Coordinating Center in facilitating interactive WIPs (usually with ~100 attendees from dozens of institutions including patient advocates) with unprecedented information and resource sharing, has made possible tremendous progress in overcoming knowledge gaps, all of which are documented in a large number of peer reviewed publications. This renewal application will continue the exceptional research momentum the SCLC Consortium has generated, and build on this initial success through support of new initiatives. These include centralized support for databasing and comparative analysis of genetically-engineered mouse models (GEMMs), and multi-parameter characterization of patient-derived xenograft models developed across the Consortium. These additional resources will be of direct utility to the SCLC research community. As part of the U24 renewal, given the remarkable growth in scope and diversity of SCLC research, we have developed a new multi-PI structure including Charles Rudin (MSK), John Minna (UTSW), with addition of two exciting young SCLC investigators who have contributed important new insights into SCLC molecular and cellular biology - Trudy Oliver (University of Utah), and Lauren Byers (MDACC). All four have been personally very active both in the U24 activities and in their own individual SCLC U01 and R01 research. The complementary strengths of this leadership team cover all of the important areas of SCLC basic, translational, and clinical trials research. Dr. Rudin will continue as contact PI, providing administrative leadership and coordination. We emphasize that the products of the Consortium will ultimately benefit human health through fostering development of novel strategies for disease prevention, early intervention, immune surveillance, metastasis suppression, and therapeutics.",2017-02-20T12:02:00Z,2027-05-31T12:05:00Z,PAR-16-050;PAR-21-346,nofo_PAR21-346,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,NEW YORK,NY,UNITED STATES,sclc
U24CA215109,TCIA Sustainment and Scalability - Platforms for Quantitative Imaging Informatics in Precision Medicine,"Project Summary The National Research Council has defined Precision Medicine as “the tailoring of medical treatments to individual characteristics of each patient.” This requires the ability to classify patients into specialized cohorts that differ in their susceptibility to a particular disease, in the biology and/or prognosis of the diseases they may develop, or in their response to a specific treatment. Identifying quantitative imaging phenotypes across scale through the use of radiomic/pathomic analyses is an evolving approach to cohort identification and to improving our understanding of cancer biology. These analytic techniques require large collections of well-curated data for algorithm testing and validation. Additional big data collections are required to test new hypotheses relating to cancer biology, prognosis and therapy response. Since 2011 the Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) has encouraged and supported cancer-related open science research by acquiring, curating, hosting and managing collections of multi-modal information. To remain relevant to its current research community and ready to support future research initiatives TCIA must undergo continuous improvement and expansion of it capabilities guided by the research community. The TCIA user community has identified four critical areas for improvement: expanded resources for integrative Image-Omics studies, enhanced capacity to acquire high quality data collections, resources to support validation studies and Research Reproducibility, and increased community engagement. The sustainment of TCIA and research community directed expansion of its capabilities will ensure this valuable resource continues to support its rapidly growing user community and continue to promote research reproducibility and data reuse in cancer precision medical research.",2017-09-22T12:09:00Z,2023-07-31T12:07:00Z,PAR-15-333,nofo_PAR15-333,UNIV OF ARKANSAS FOR MED SCIS,LITTLE ROCK,AR,UNITED STATES,itcr
U24CA215123,"The TOPAS Tool for Particle Simulation, a Monte Carlo Simulation Tool for Physics, Biology and Clinical Research","The TOPAS TOol for PArticle Simulation, launched on NCI funding in 2009, is a breakthrough software project that struck down a usability barrier that was limiting cancer research and treatment. Improvements to radiotherapy and imaging require understanding how subatomic particles travel through apparatus and tissue. The most precise calculations of such motion follow the Monte Carlo (MC) method. Yet MC's painstaking specialized computer programming techniques had limited its availability to a small number of specialists. TOPAS brings a reliable, experimentally validated and easy-to-use MC tool within reach of every physicist. Requiring no programming knowledge, TOPAS provides nearly unlimited flexibility. It enables both clinical applications (e.g. high precision patient dose calculation) and cutting edge research (e.g. four dimensional time-of-flight simulations for detector developments), while its design promotes inter-institutional collaboration. In 2013, on a second NCI award, TOPAS was expanded from its initial focus on proton therapy physics to also cover radiation biology. TOPAS has been widely accepted in proton therapy physics and biology with 272 users at 121 institutions in 24 countries, but those working on other radiotherapy modalities and medical imaging lack such a tool. We seek to address these needs, creating the only fully integrated platform for advanced radiotherapy including multi-modality treatments and a broad range of image guidance. We shall: Specific Aim 1: Enhance the TOPAS Environment for User-Friendly Interactive Modeling and Simulation · Expand support for multi-processor, cluster, cloud and grid environments · Improve I/O compatibility with other medical physics standards · Improve computational speed and Graphical User Interface Specific Aim 2: Extend TOPAS Capabilities for Translational and Clinical Applications · Library of radiotherapy and imaging components, simplify simulation of complex therapy, QA and shielding · Biological models for radiation protection and pre-clinical research · Imaging systems and patient simulation, including more complex patient models Specific Aim 3: Maintain TOPAS for all User Communities · Respond to changes in underlying software packages and operating systems · Expand automated regression testing system for quality control Specific Aim 4: Disseminate TOPAS with Full Participation in ITCR Program Activities · Disseminate TOPAS through workshops at key conferences and web site · Provide user support through online user forum, web-based training and twice-yearly in-person trainings · Develop TOPAS user collaboration, initiate projects to address key user needs identified post-award, maintain depository for users to exchange customizations and extensions, move TOPAS to open source",2018-06-04T12:06:00Z,2024-05-31T12:05:00Z,PAR-15-331,nofo_PAR15-331,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",SAN FRANCISCO,CA,UNITED STATES,itcr
U24CA220242,"Detection of somatic, subclonal and mosaic CNVs from sequencing","Project Summary/Abstract Progress in technology has made individual genome sequencing a clinical reality, with partial genome sequencing already in use in clinical care. In fact, it is expected that within a few years whole genome sequencing will be a standard procedure that will allow discovering personal genomic variants of all types and thus greatly facilitate individualized medicine. However, fast and reliable analysis of such data is challenging; and improvements in analytics are needed before the clinical potential of whole genome sequencing can be realized. Specifically, copy number variations account for a large proportion of human genetic diversity, are frequently observed in cancer, and have been associated with multiple diseases, cancer susceptibility, cancer progression and invasiveness, individual response to treatment, and patients' quality of life after treatment (i.e., emergence of side effects). Therefore, comprehensive identification and analysis of copy-number variants will help us more fully elucidate the biology of their functional effects on human health (in particular, for cancer emergence and progression) and will facilitate clinical diagnostics and treatment. However, abilities to detect CNVs/CNAs from sequencing are not fully utilized due to immature analytical approaches. This proposal suggests continuing development and enhancement of analytical approaches for the detection of copy number variants and aberrations from sequencing data. Historically, the development of concepts, techniques, and methods in the basic sciences has been followed by their transition and use in applied areas. Specifically, advances in biology lead to applications in medicine. The developments we propose anticipate many forthcoming applications of whole genome sequencing in medicine, and set up a computational framework to power clinical care with tools for copy number variants discovery and analysis. 3",2018-05-01T12:05:00Z,2024-04-30T12:04:00Z,PAR-15-331,nofo_PAR15-331,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,ROCHESTER,MN,UNITED STATES,itcr
U24CA220245,The Duke Preclinical Research Resources for Quantitative Imaging Biomarkers,"Abstract Quantitative imaging approaches are currently being standardized for clinical medicine by the Quantitative Imaging Biomarkers Alliance (QIBA). However, similar efforts for preclinical imaging do not exist although the need for standardization is even more pressing because of the high degree of diversity that exists in preclinical imaging hardware and software. Compared to clinical (human) imaging, the technical challenges are significantly more difficult for the optimization of mouse model quantitative imaging. The goal of this proposal is to design, optimize and apply preclinical quantitative imaging with micro-magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and micro- computed tomography (CT). Specifically, we will apply our quantitative imaging methods in a co- clinical trial which mirrors an on-going, multi-institutional, randomized phase II clinical trial that has a primary objective to investigate whether neoadjuvant radiotherapy combined with pembrolizumab followed by surgical resection and adjuvant pembrolizumab improves disease-free survival for patients with high-risk soft-tissue sarcoma of the extremity (undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma or dedifferentiated/pleomorphic liposarcoma) compared to radiotherapy alone followed by surgical resection. The trial aims to evaluate the 2- and 5-year recurrence-free survival and overall survival. MRI is used to assess the radiation treatment response and to plan for surgery. Chest CT is used during follow up to evaluate for distant tumor recurrence (lung metastases). For preclinical studies, we will use the Cre-loxP technology to generate primary sarcomas in the hind limb of mice. Our autochthonous tumor models closely mimic human soft tissue sarcomas in histologic appearance, gene expression, and clinical behavior, including lung metastasis development. For the metastatic tumor model, the primary tumor-bearing limb will be amputated and mice will be monitored for metastases. In our first specific aim, we will develop and optimize quantitative imaging with micro-MRI for primary soft tissue sarcoma tumors and micro-CT for lung metastases. We will follow similar methodologies proposed in the QIBA framework but adapted for small animal imaging. During the second aim, we will implement our optimized quantitative imaging methods in the co-clinical trial using our genetically engineered mouse models of sarcoma. We anticipate that radiotherapy with PD-1 inhibitors will improve metastasis-free survival. The preclinical experiments will provide greater understanding of mechanisms involved in these combined therapies and will inform future clinical trials. Finally, the last specific aim will focus on creating a web- accessible research resource for archiving and disseminating small animal imaging protocols and data. Imaging and biologic data, including pathology, will be robustly integrated for correlative studies. The expected outcome of this project is the standardization of micro-MRI and micro-CT preclinical imaging for cancer studies. This standardization will facilitate and guide the incorporation of small animal imaging into future pre- and co- clinical trials involving new therapeutic approaches to cancer treatment. Ultimately, reduced variability in preclinical imaging studies will improve the value of quantitative correlations established between pathophysiological biomarkers and imaging biomarkers.",2017-09-30T12:09:00Z,2023-01-31T12:01:00Z,PAR-16-385,nofo_PAR-16-385,DUKE UNIVERSITY,DURHAM,NC,UNITED STATES,cirp
U24CA220325,MDACC-PREDICT,"Project Summary This application proposes a new U24 Oncology Co-Clinical Imaging Resource entitled VU-PREDICT (Vanderbilt University-PET imaging Resource to Enhance Delivery of Individualized Cancer Therapeutics). Precision cancer medicine, which seeks to exploit unique cellular, molecular and genetic characteristics of individual tumors to optimize treatment, remains a critically unmet need. Despite advances in biomarker technologies that yield high-quality cellular and genomic data, critical gaps remain to consistently match patients with cancer and ideal therapies. While `predictive' genomic assays based on RNA and DNA are now commonplace, current methods largely ignore tumor phenotypes differentiable by quantitative imaging. The overarching vision for VU-PREDICT is a suite of quantitative imaging tools that facilitate the discovery of novel, predictive imaging-derived gene expression signatures; such signatures can be deployed by the greater oncology community to improve the personalization of cancer treatment. The linchpin of VU-PREDICT will be positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. The sensitive and quantitative nature of PET, coupled with the ability to produce biologically active PET tracers, renders PET uniquely capable of both detecting tumors and profiling their specific features. Complementary to genomic approaches, PET imaging provides a quantitative, functional measure of tumor phenotype, and when coupled biopsy approaches, can provide a significantly greater breadth of biological characterization. VU-PREDICT centers on a parallel co-clinical trial of patients with advanced colorectal cancer (CRC) and human-in-mouse PDX (patient-derived xenograft) models. CRC is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs; cetuximab, panitumumab) are approved for treatment of advanced wild-type (WT) RAS CRC. However, durable responses to anti-EGFR mAbs occur in only 12–17% of patients. VU-PREDICT will capitalize upon a Phase I/II clinical trial opening at Vanderbilt combining a glutaminase (GLS1) inhibitor (CB-839, Calithera), EGFR mAb therapy (panitumumab) and irinotecan in patients with advanced and refractory WT RAS CRC. It is anticipated that combining CB-839 with EGFR mAb therapy will resensitize refractory CRC patients with Gln- avid tumors to EGFR blockade. VU-PREDICT will allow our development of quantitative PET imaging measures within this trial and in related preclinical studies that may identify patients likely to respond to combined GLS1/EGFR inhibition.

GSEA derives its power from identifying the activation/repression of sets of genes that share common biological function, chromosomal location or regulation and differentiate biological phenotypes or cellular states. This knowledge-based approach is effective in elucidating underlying biological mechanisms and generating hypotheses for further study and experimental validation. Since 2005, we have developed, distributed and supported a freely available GSEA software application along with a database of annotated gene sets – the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB). This popular resource has more than 113,000 registered users and over 10,200 citations in the literature, and the MSigDB has almost 18,000 annotated sets. The goal of this proposal is to continue to evolve and add value to the GSEA/MSigDB resource to best address the needs of the cancer research community, while maintaining the high level of professional quality and strong support that investigators have come to expect. We plan to increase the power and sensitivity of the GSEA method and enrich the MSigDB to further accelerate the pace of genomic research. Our specific aims are: Aim 1: Develop and deploy the next generation of the GSEA method and software to keep pace with the needs of the cancer research community. The new core algorithm will be based on information- theoretic approaches, guided by a collection of 100 relevant benchmarks and informed by an Advisory Board of established cancer researchers. To facilitate the use of GSEA by researchers at all levels of computational sophistication, we will distribute the GSEA analysis tools as both an open source code library and a suite of user friendly, reproducible, interactive, electronic notebooks. Aim 2: Extend the scope and specificity of the MSigDB, and evolve the underlying technology. In collaboration with the community, we will add valuable new collections to MSigDB including signatures of drug responses and genetic perturbations, sets for use with mouse models of cancer and PDXs, sets from pathway and network databases, and sets for use with proteomic data analysis. The MSigDB will be redesigned from its current XML file format and deployed as a lightweight, portable relational database that can better support its growing size, online exploration tools, and use by investigators and other software. Aim 3: Provide training and outreach activities for the cancer research community, and maintain and support the GSEA software and MSigDB. The success and popularity of the GSEA/MSigDB resource over the past decade;; our extensive experience in developing computational methods for genomics research and delivering them as user-friendly, high quality software;; our significant user base and many citations;; our large repository of gene sets;; and our successful delivery of documentation and training for users make us well poised to carry out the aims of this proposal.",2018-05-01T12:05:00Z,2024-04-30T12:04:00Z,PAR-15-333,nofo_PAR15-333,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",LA JOLLA,CA,UNITED STATES,itcr
U24CA220441,Developing the JBrowse Genome Browser to Visualize Structural Variants and Cancer Genomics Data,"Cancer begins with mutations of the genome that can include substitutions, indels, duplications, gene fusions, and genome rearrangements. These mutational signatures vary widely between tissues and, often, between individual tumors. To understand this mutational landscape, cancer researchers need tools for visualizing the structural variation in cancer DNA, and its impact on gene transcription and regulation. For greater insight, these data should be augmented with gene annotations, results from functional genomics project like ENCODE, and population-level data. The classic tool for visualizing human gene annotations is the web-based genome browser. However, genome browsers are not generally well-suited to visualizing large-scale structural variation: for that, circular visualization tools (such as Circos) are often used, but those tools are not very interactive (or web-based). Additionally, few genome browsers allow analysis to be performed within the application itself. JBrowse is the most popular genome browser built using JavaScript and dynamic web technology. Originally aimed at model organism genome projects, it is the web-based browser predominantly used by such projects, and yet its single largest user is now the UK-based Cancer Genome Project. We have developed prototypes of an interactive circular view for JBrowse, a data loading pipeline to import human genome annotations, a framework for running interactive analyses from within the browser. We plan to extend these prototypes to a fully-fledged system for visualizing structural variants and other mutations in cancer genomes, and running analyses on those data. We will integrate this software with the systems of the Cancer Genome Project, the International Cancer Genome Consortium, and the Genomic Data Commons.",2017-08-01T12:08:00Z,2022-07-31T12:07:00Z,PAR-15-331,nofo_PAR15-331,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,BERKELEY,CA,UNITED STATES,itcr
U24CA220457,The cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics,"PROJECT SUMMARY Genomic sequencing and molecular profiling of tumor samples is becoming routine at many cancer centers, and the scientific community is poised to sequence hundreds of thousands of tumor samples over the next five years, providing unprecedented insight into cancer initiation, progression, and treatment effects. Ensuring that these data sets are easily accessible and interpretable to scientists and clinicians is of vital importance. Towards this end, we seek to continually evolve and expand the capabilities of the cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics, a unique and vital platform that enables interactive exploratory data analysis of large-scale cancer genomic data sets. The cBioPortal has become the most widely used tool within the cancer genomics community and is the most highly cited. The public site (cbioportal.org) contains data from more than 20,000 tumor samples, including all data from The Cancer Genome Atlas, and is accessed by more than 25,000 unique users each month. Since the software is available under an open source license, there are >40 local installations of the software system at cancer centers and drug companies, and multiple institutions are making contributions to the software, including the four that are part of this application (Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, and Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia). To ensure that this vital resource continues to aid the cancer research community and to keep pace with the rapidly advancing fields of cancer genomics and precision cancer medicine, and the imminent steep increase in the number of profiled tumor samples, we propose to actively sustain and evolve the cBioPortal platform. Specifically, we will implement major architectural changes to the cBioPortal software to ensure future scalability and performance, and accelerate new feature development (Aim 1). We will also develop novel analysis tools for drug target discovery in large cancer genomics cohorts, as well as new features for precision cancer medicine, including for clinical trial design and the budding field of immunogenomics (Aim 2). We also plan to build and leverage a vibrant open source software development community to maintain and adapt the software and develop essential new features (Aim 3). Finally, to maximize use in the scientific community, we plan to expand community outreach and education, and create mechanisms for community engagement and feedback (Aim 4). With these improvements, the cBioPortal has the potential to significantly accelerate cancer research and development of new biomarkers and drugs. Several cancer centers are already using the cBioPortal as part of their precision medicine programs to guide interpretation of genomic variants. We expect that, over the next few years, the cBioPortal will have a tremendous impact on all areas of basic cancer research and patient care.",2017-08-01T12:08:00Z,2022-09-30T12:09:00Z,PAR-15-333,nofo_PAR15-333,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,NEW YORK,NY,UNITED STATES,itcr
U24CA221936,Coordinating Center for Population-based Research to Optimize Cancer Screening (PROSPR) (U24),"Project Summary Cancer screening is a complex, multi-step process where benefits are maximized when each step is completed successfully, but where sub-optimal outcomes are frequent as a result of breakdowns that can happen at any point in this process. Screening is also impacted by factors beyond simply individual patients—including factors at the provider-, practice-, and health plan/institution-level—and these so-called systems level factors can impact the appropriate delivery of high quality cancer screening services. PROSPR was established to address a number of critical questions related to the delivery of cancer screening in the United States, and our PROSPR I Statistical Coordinating Center was central to many of the successes of this initiative including: 1) Developing a trans-organ conceptual model of cancer screening processes, 2) Creating common data elements and screening performance metrics, 3) Evaluating individual and systems-level factors impacting screening performance, 4) Authorship and statistical support on 21 trans-network published papers, 2 under review, and 17 in preparation; and 5) Establishing PROSPR data repositories and creating an infrastructure for publicly sharing PROSPR data. Our PCC team has considerable expertise both in the leadership of large coordinating centers and in each of the scientific fields relevant to PROSPR including health services/health care delivery, implementation science, cancer epidemiology, health disparities research, biostatistics, bioinformatics/health information technology, and the screening of colorectal, cervical, and lung cancers. Thus, we are uniquely positioned to successfully execute all components of this coordinating center. The specific aims of our PCC are to: 1) Provide administrative coordination for the PROSPR network and guidance in the development of PROSPR’s governance, organization, and policies/procedures; 2) Lead the development of common conceptualization and measures for: A. Assessing the role of systems-level factors that impact the screening process. B. Assessing screening quality; 3) Facilitate trans-PROSPR research comparing the screening process across at least 2 organ sites; and 4) Develop and implement processes and procedures to share PROSPR data with qualified investigators outside of the PROSPR network. RELEVANCE: Improving both the screening process and screening quality for cervical, colorectal, and lung cancers will reduce mortality, morbidity, and health care costs associated with these cancers in the United States.",2018-04-15T12:04:00Z,2024-03-31T12:03:00Z,RFA-CA-16-017,nofo_CA16-017,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER CENTER,Seattle,WA,UNITED STATES,prospr
U24CA224020,Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma Translational Resource Center (PATReC),"ABSTRACT In contrast to the decline in mortality in other cancers, the incidence of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is increasing, and therapeutic approaches, for the most part, have not been successful at improving survival in patients. Although recent advances in immunotherapy have shown efficacy in various solid cancers, comparable efficacy in PDAC has been limited by a complex tumor microenvironment (TME) that creates an immune suppressive milieu ripe for tumor progression. Thus, bold interventions that can overcome immune barriers in the PDAC TME are urgently needed to reduce the mortality stemming from this recalcitrant disease. The U01 “Consortium for PDAC Translational Studies on the TME” was created through the National Cancer Moonshot initiative to accelerate the pace of progress in innovative therapies targeting the TME in PDAC, especially those geared towards immune-based modalities. Our proposal is in response to the companion U24 RFA to create a resource center for the five funded Consortium sites, which we call Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma Translational Resource Center (PATReC). The PATReC will be co-led by Drs. Ignacio Wistuba and Anirban Maitra, two established molecular pathologists at UT MD Anderson Cancer Center (UTMDACC) with long-standing expertise in cancer biomarkers, tissue based molecular profiling, and with respect to one co-leader (AM), specific expertise in PDAC biology, disease models and experimental therapeutics. They will be supported by an exceptional supporting cast, including Drs. Jack Lee (biostatistics), Andy Futreal (cancer genomics and computational biology), Jason Roszik (bioinformatics) and Stan Hamilton (co-leader of the NCI MATCH biorepository). The overall goal is to support the consortium efforts in multiple areas including: providing an administrative infrastructure for coordinated interactions amongst the U01 awardees; facilitating centralized biospecimen banking and distribution; enabling centralized data storage capabilities; and credentialed biostatistics and bioinformatics support with the ultimate goal of designing translationally relevant combination interventions targeting the TME in PDAC. In Aim 1, we will support administrative coordination amongst the U01 sites by ensuring effective communication, cooperation, and access to rapid data exchange that will advance the goals of the individual Consortium sites. The PATReC will serve as the central “hub” for virtual and in-person communication across the entire Consortium. In Aim 2, we will utilize our unique institutional infrastructure to provide centralized data management services that will be readily accessible to all Consortium sites via a secure website, and provide bioinformatics and biostatics services for the analyses and interpretation of data.

U24CA224067,PDXNet Data Commons and Coordinating Center,"PROJECT SUMMARY Patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) are a powerful model system to assess efficacy of anti-cancer agents and understand molecular mechanisms of drug resistance. By applying agent combinations against patient-derived models, it is possible to obtain evidence to determine the most promising combinations for advancement to clinical testing in defined sub-populations of cancer patients. However, integration of PDX drug response with molecular characterization data across diverse PDX collections is needed to enable this vision. A key aspect is the need for well-managed resources for community sharing and large-scale analysis of standardized datasets from PDXs and other patient-derived models. The Jackson Laboratory-Seven Bridges (JAX-SB) PDX Data Commons and Coordination Center (PDCCC) has addressed this challenge for the last 5 years, uniting the efforts of the data-generating (PDX Development and Trial Centers/PDTCs) and PDX model sharing (NCI’s Patient-Derived Model Repository/PDMR) components of the PDX Development and Trials Centers Research Network (PDXNet) into a cohesive, trans-Network whole. Using innovative cloud computing and bioinformatic approaches, our PDCCC provides administrative and computational infrastructure for PDXNet to enable PDX method standardization, model sharing, data sharing, and massive-scale data analysis. To date, we have built the PDXNet Portal, which currently contains PDXNet model information and data resources from 334 new models across 33 cancer types. Our PDCCC team has both facilitated and actively guided consortium collaborative projects, leading to several major publications and 10 Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program Letters of Intent. Here, we propose to enhance the PDXNet Portal and refine our organizational activities to address needs clarified by the NCI and PDX communities, including: faster translation of PDX studies to clinical trials; precise organization and sharing of multi-omic and treatment response data; and development of predictors of clinical treatment response. Our Specific Aims are: 1) To provide robust PDCCC support for PDXNet stakeholders through regular committees, personnel expertise, and project tools; 2) To enhance PDXNet Portal content, functionality, and data sharing; and 3) To develop and implement strategies that accelerate PDX translation to clinical trials. Through these Aims, we will coordinate the activities of the PDXNet to increase the value of patient-derived cancer model treatment studies and speed the generation of clinical trials.",2017-09-25T12:09:00Z,2028-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-17-004;RFA-CA-22-013,nofo_RFA-CA-22-013,JACKSON LABORATORY,BAR HARBOR,ME,UNITED STATES,pdxnet
U24CA224285,MD Anderson Cancer Immune Monitoring and Analysis Center MDA-CIMAC,"ABSTRACT Immunotherapy (IMT) has emerged as a promising treatment strategy across a broad spectrum of human cancers, with multiple agents, particularly immune check point inhibitors, showing promising results in various types of cancers. Its full potential has yet to be realized, due in part, to a lack of biomarkers predicting response to treatment. Multiple immune and genomic biomarkers of response based on analysis of pre-treatment specimens have been described but most are not very robust with significant overlap between responders and non-responders. Therefore, there is a critical unmet need to perform comprehensive characterization of candidate biomarkers in early phase IMT trials using standardized assays and novel methodologies. Recognizing the need for comprehensive immune monitoring for IMT clinical trials, in 2017 NCI developed the Cancer Immune Monitoring and Analysis Center (CIMAC) and Cancer Immunologic Data Commons (CIDC) Network, with the goal of identifying biomarkers of response, resistance, and adverse events to optimize immunotherapy approaches for patients with cancer. The MD Anderson Cancer Immune Monitoring and Analysis Center (MDA-CIMAC) is one of four CIMAC sites established five years ago that has been standardizing genomic, pathology and immunology assays and supporting profiling of tissue and blood specimens from patients treated in IMT trials. The MDA-CIMAC will be co-led by Drs. Ignacio Wistuba, renowned cancer surgical and molecular pathologist, Gheath Al-Atrash, well-known medical oncologist with expertise in stem cell transplantation and immunotherapy, and Cara Haymaker, cancer immunologist with expertise in immune biomarker analysis. They will be supported by a multidisciplinary team of world-class and highly collaborative experts on cancer and immunotherapy. The main goals of MDA-CIMAC are to: 1) provide a centralized and harmonized platform for sample collection, processing and quality assurance, and 2) use analytically-validated and standardized (Tiers 1 and 2) and highly innovative (Tier 3) assays to offer analyses for phenotypic, genomic, and functional characterization of responses of patients enrolled on IMT clinical trials. In Aim 1, we will utilize Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) following the developed CIMAC umbrella protocol to provide services for processing and distribution of annotated biospecimens from the NCI-sponsored early phase immunotherapy clinical trials and to link the specimens to relevant clinical, pathological, immune and molecular data within the CIMAC-CIDC Network. In Aim 2, we will perform routine and innovative pathological, immunological and molecular analyses using standardized and validated and highly innovative assays to aid the completion of NCI- sponsored early phase clinical trials and the development of novel predictive IMT biomarkers.

U24CA224316,Cancer Immunologic Data Commons,"PROJECT SUMMARY Cancer immunotherapies have emerged as highly promising approaches to treat cancer patients, particularly since they can be applied across different tissue and cancer types, although clinical efficacy has been limited to a subset of cancer patients. Translational studies with strong focus on biomarkers are critical to understanding the tumor-immune interface. Although numerous technologies for tumor and immune profiling are applied to NCI sponsored immunotherapy trials, standardization of both assay protocols and data analysis methods is crucial to data integration and comparisons across studies for biomarker identification. This underlines the need for data harmonization and creation of uniform analysis pipelines. We propose to establish the Cancer Immunology Data Commons (CIDC) at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute with the goal of advancing translational research efforts using biomarkers to aid in the further development of cancer immunotherapy. The short-term objectives of this application are to establish and manage the data repository for biomarkers and associated clinical data for Cancer Immune Monitoring and Analysis Centers (CIMACs), and provide an informatics environment for integrative multi- dimensional analysis across different studies and storage of data generated. Specifically, we propose to: Aim 1, coordinate with the CIMAC and Laboratory Coordinating Committee (LCC) to harmonize establish assay protocols and data format standards; Aim 2, develop a centralized data repository and management system, and coordinate CIMAC data submission to the CIDC; Aim 3, develop uniform bioinformatics processing pipelines and computing infrastructure for computationally intensive analyses for the CIMACs and the larger research community; Aim 4, provide bioinformatics algorithms to enable integrative and correlative analysis of CIMAC data and integrate other accessible databases and resources for biomarker discovery; Aim 5, develop centralized role-based data access functions with advanced programming interface to enable sharing of CIMAC data; Aim 6, develop interactive web visualization functions to enable investigators and the immunology communities to examine the CIMAC data; and Aim 7, coordinate within the CIMACs-CIDC Network logistic and scientific activities for biomarker discovery and validation. At the conclusion, we will have established a biomarker repository for all data and results generated by CIMACs, supplemented with standardized informatics tools for integration with other accessible databases, and compatible for data contribution and secondary analyses by external researchers. These efforts will provide bioinformatics support for the CIMACs-CIDC Network. The established Data Commons will also provide the foundation for a future immuno-oncology data resource for the larger research community.",2017-09-30T12:09:00Z,2023-06-30T12:06:00Z,RFA-CA-17-006,nofo_RFA-CA-17-006,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,BOSTON,MA,UNITED STATES,cidc
U24CA224319,High-Dimensional Immune Monitoring of NCI-Supported Immunotherapy Trials,"SUMMARY Defining who is likely to respond to cancer immunotherapy and who may not benefit, due to primary/secondary resistance or adverse events, is of critical interest for improving immuno-oncology (IO) treatments. Most clinical trials of novel combinations either fail to include any support for complex correlative biomarker discovery, often due to costs of specimen collection and assays, or are performed in an idiosyncratic manner, making non- standardized data difficult to integrate as part of a larger repository. There is a need to go beyond just PD-L1 tissue expression and tumor mutation burden as FDA-approved yet imperfect predictors of immune checkpoint blockade, by generating high-dimensional datasets that characterize the tumor immune microenvironment, systemic circulating immune and proteomic markers from blood, and host-level immune fitness information (microbiome). The Cancer Immune Monitoring and Analysis Centers, Cancer Immunologic Data Commons, and Partnership for Accelerating Cancer Therapies (CIMAC-CIDC-PACT) is a Cancer Moonshot-funded network that brings together laboratory, clinical, and computational scientists, administrators, and regulatory specialists from four institutions, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (ISMMS), MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC), Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI), and Stanford University. Our unprecedented, coordinated effort to conduct IO clinical trial correlative studies and define new candidate biomarkers to improve immunotherapy had resulted in 37 clinical trials selected in the first funding period, with ongoing datasets resulted for 17 of them. This was achieved using rigorously assessed SOPs and processes from trial selection to data sharing. We propose to continue and expand these efforts as follows: A set of well-established, harmonized, high-dimensional tumor and blood-based assays will be applied to all newly selected trials, with the aim of evaluating and validating novel biomarker of treatment, clinical response, and/or adverse events (Aim 1). To spur innovation and increase granularity of our understanding of mechanism of action, high-tech yet validated single cell and spatial transcriptomic technologies as well as other omics will be proposed in exceptional patients for unbiased phenotyping, tissue composition, architectural organization, and immune profiling (Aim 2). The resulting unified data repository will be mined to define multi-omic and cross-trial markers, through biostatistical and computational innovative design to integrate datasets from various assays into higher analytical archetypes across studies (Aim 3).

U24CA224319,High-Dimensional Immune Monitoring of NCI-Supported Immunotherapy Trials,"SUMMARY Defining who is likely to respond to cancer immunotherapy and who may not benefit, due to primary/secondary resistance or adverse events, is of critical interest for improving immuno-oncology (IO) treatments. Most clinical trials of novel combinations either fail to include any support for complex correlative biomarker discovery, often due to costs of specimen collection and assays, or are performed in an idiosyncratic manner, making non- standardized data difficult to integrate as part of a larger repository. There is a need to go beyond just PD-L1 tissue expression and tumor mutation burden as FDA-approved yet imperfect predictors of immune checkpoint blockade, by generating high-dimensional datasets that characterize the tumor immune microenvironment, systemic circulating immune and proteomic markers from blood, and host-level immune fitness information (microbiome). The Cancer Immune Monitoring and Analysis Centers, Cancer Immunologic Data Commons, and Partnership for Accelerating Cancer Therapies (CIMAC-CIDC-PACT) is a Cancer Moonshot-funded network that brings together laboratory, clinical, and computational scientists, administrators, and regulatory specialists from four institutions, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (ISMMS), MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC), Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI), and Stanford University. Our unprecedented, coordinated effort to conduct IO clinical trial correlative studies and define new candidate biomarkers to improve immunotherapy had resulted in 37 clinical trials selected in the first funding period, with ongoing datasets resulted for 17 of them. This was achieved using rigorously assessed SOPs and processes from trial selection to data sharing. We propose to continue and expand these efforts as follows: A set of well-established, harmonized, high-dimensional tumor and blood-based assays will be applied to all newly selected trials, with the aim of evaluating and validating novel biomarker of treatment, clinical response, and/or adverse events (Aim 1). To spur innovation and increase granularity of our understanding of mechanism of action, high-tech yet validated single cell and spatial transcriptomic technologies as well as other omics will be proposed in exceptional patients for unbiased phenotyping, tissue composition, architectural organization, and immune profiling (Aim 2). The resulting unified data repository will be mined to define multi-omic and cross-trial markers, through biostatistical and computational innovative design to integrate datasets from various assays into higher analytical archetypes across studies (Aim 3). Together, our network is at the forefront of immune monitoring standards, by balancing innovation with reproducibility, to comprehensively assess biomarkers and strive for precision cancer treatment. We are poised to create an unparalleled resource of harmonized, clinically annotated datasets shared with the public that will establish best practice guidelines with the research community.

U24CA224331,Cancer Immune Monitoring and Analysis Center,"Summary Because cancer immunotherapy constitutes one of the most transformative therapeutic movements over the history of cancer treatment, there are now hundreds, if not thousands, of ongoing clinical trials in this field. Despite the remarkable success for a subset of patients, there are substantial gaps in our knowledge. No more than 30% of patients respond to immune checkpoint blockade and related therapies, many responding patients develop therapeutic resistance, and many responding and non-responding patients suffer from immune-related toxicities. There is a clear need to identify critical biomarkers of response, resistance, and toxicity. To improve our ability to meet this challenge, the NCI-sponsored Cancer Immune Monitoring and Analysis Center (CIMAC) program was created to enable consistent and comparable interrogation of patient biospecimens across multiple clinical trials. The program has successfully established a common set of assays harmonized across the four CIMACs, augmented this basic set with more specialized tests that may be CIMAC-specific but are still accessible across institutions, deployed these tools across dozens of phase I/II immunotherapy trials, and generated a pool of standardized data to facilitate inter-trial comparisons. The CIMAC created at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) built on the existing Center of Immuno-Oncology (CIO) and the long-standing collaboration with the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. The DFCI/Broad CIMAC, joining with the other CIMACS, now proposes to continue the network mission to compare tumor and immune response features of individual cancer types treated by multiple immunotherapeutic modalities and multiple cancer types treated by a single immunotherapeutic modality in order to dissect common and individualized mechanisms of action. One driving motivation for this renewal application is that the power to identify biomarkers increases with the number of clinical trials analyzed. Thus, Aim 1 focuses on deploying the suite of assays established over the past five years to biospecimens collected from additional innovative immunotherapy clinical trials to standardize biomarker analysis and interpretation. To broaden the scope of parameters being examined, Aim 2 proposes to develop and verify performance for novel and more complex assays to expand the network capabilities and advance discovery. Of particular value will be methods that improve multiomic single cell profiling, multiomic spatial analysis, and immunopeptidome characterization. Aim 3 addresses the challenge of integrating multiomic data across an increasing number of clinical trials by building novel computational tools that can efficiently process massive amounts of data and generate interpretable representations of the results. Altogether, these efforts will support the role of immuno-oncology in the personalized treatment of cancer because only by the analyses of large well-annotated datasets can we identify links between biology, molecular markers and clinical response.",2017-09-30T12:09:00Z,2028-06-30T12:06:00Z,RFA-CA-17-005;RFA-CA-22-038,nofo_RFA-CA-22-038,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,BOSTON,MA,UNITED STATES,cidc

U24CA226110,INTEGRATING OMICS AND QUANTITATIVE IMAGING DATA IN CO-CLINICAL TRIALS TO PREDICT TREATMENT RESPONSE IN TRIPLE NEGATIVE BREAST CANCER,"Project Summary Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a very challenging disease because it is biologically aggressive, there are no targeted therapies, and, consequently, patients have poor prognosis. Although immunotherapy is promising for treating many cancers, TNBC lacks specific molecular targets, no predictive biomarkers to chemotherapy response have yet been identified, and treatment response is difficult to evaluate using current biomarker assessments. Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of TNBC offer the exciting opportunity of evaluating this disease in terms of molecular features (e.g., genomic copy number, whole exome sequence, and mRNA expression) to identify candidate “omic” biomarkers that best predict the ultimate response to treatment and could provide surrogate endpoints to validate novel imaging biomarkers in co-clinical trial human trails. Moreover, emerging quantitative MRI methods, such as dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) and diffusion weighted MRI (DW-MRI), contain rich physiological signals in the images for predicting treatment response, but it is challenging to integrate both animal and human data to reliably predict the treatment response. A paradigm of “co-clinical trials” is emerging in which new treatments are evaluated in animals, and the results guide treatments in clinical trials, but there is a paucity of informatics tools and resources to enable analyses in such animal-to-human work. We believe that an informatics-based methodology that integrates molecular `omics' and imaging data will propel advances in TNBC by enabling development of machine learning models to predict the response to therapies. In order to develop research resources that will encourage consensus on how quantitative imaging methods are optimized to improve the quality of imaging results for co-clinical trials, we will leverage an ongoing co-clinical trial we are undertaking to pursue the following specific aims: (1) Identify molecular biomarkers that predict response in TNBC patient-derived xenografts (PDX); (2) Identify quantitative MRI biomarkers that predict response in TNBC patient-derived xenografts; and (3) Evaluate our informatics tools in a prospective co-clinical trial. Our proposed research is significant and innovative because it leverages advances in basic cancer biology, state-of-the-art imaging technologies, and informatics methods to develop a resource to catalyze discovery in this important disease. Our PDX-based approach will provide the cancer community with a rational, iterative, combined pre-clinical and clinical methodology and supporting data resource for making progressively more refined and personalized therapeutic regimens for TNBC patients. Our methods and tools will likely also generalize to other cancers and could, therefore, substantially benefit the care of all cancer patients.",2019-09-19T12:09:00Z,2024-08-31T12:08:00Z,PAR-18-841,nofo_PAR-18-841,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,HOUSTON,TX,UNITED STATES,cirp
U24CA230144,Consortium on Translational Research in Early Detection of Liver Cancer:Data Management and Coordinating Center (DMCC),"PROJECT SUMMARY ABSTRACT The key to success of the Consortium on Translational Research in Early Detection of Liver Cancer (Consortium) lies in good communication among scientists in multiple disciplines, efficient evaluation and prioritization of promising biomarkers, and rigorous validation studies to demonstrate their potential clinical utilities in improving the surveillance and early detection of liver cancer and stratifying the risk of liver cancer in patients with cirrhosis. The overall aims of the proposed Data Management and Coordinating Center (DMCC) are to (i) enhance communication and collaboration among Consortium investigators; (ii) coordinate Consortium collaborative research and provide statistical support; (iii) develop and maintain integrated research and biorepository databases for Consortium studies; and (iv) support and facilitate trans-Consortium collaborative research. Under the direction of the Consortium Steering Committee, the DMCC will 1) perform network coordination and promote collaborations among scientific investigators by providing support for Consortium meetings and conference calls, developing and maintaining all Consortium documents, including the Manual of Operations and Procedures (MOP), and by maintaining and enhancing the Consortium’s secure website; 2) support Consortium collaborative studies by working with Consortium investigators on study design, protocol development, data forms, and study manuals; coordinating and monitoring studies; tracking specimen sharing, blinding, and randomization; and performing QA/QC and study evaluation; 3) maintain and enhance the COMPASS Data Management System (CDMS) used to facilitate Consortium collaborative activities. CDMS provides online, end- to-end data management solutions, including investigator and study coordinator communications, regulatory compliance, remote subject registration, clinical data capture, biospecimen sample management, imaging data repository, and document management. CDMS can provide online visibility of analytical datasets for all participating researchers, and statistical and informatic tools relevant to Consortium research; 4) support and facilitate trans-Consortium collaborative studies by promoting team science, monitoring study procedures, and using cutting edge statistical, computational, and Artificial Intelligence methods to ensure efficient yet rigorous study design and maximize research outputs. Our research strategy is built from this guiding principle: provide the highest quality service to the Consortium while remaining innovative and providing scientific leadership to help the Consortium achieve its mission. Our qualifications include being the DMCC for the Early Detection Research Network since its inception, serving as lead statisticians for the two largest ongoing cirrhosis cohort studies in this country, and being responsible for two FDA-cleared Imaging AI products and many statistical innovations in early detection research.",2018-09-17T12:09:00Z,2028-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-17-028;RFA-CA-22-032,nofo_RFA-CA-22-032,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER CENTER,Seattle,WA,UNITED STATES,tlc
U24CA231846,WebMeV: A Robust Platform for Intuitive Genomic Data Analysis,"Project Summary/Abstract: Improvements in sequencing technology have allowed genome and transcriptome profiling of large groups of research subjects. Projects such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE), the Genotype-Tissue Expression Project (GTEx), and other have placed large, complex, multi- omic data into the public domain. While these large projects and the use of new sequencing technologies has made an unprecedented quantity of data available, technical challenges such as moving and analyzing large multi-omic data sets, and the lack of intuitive and easy to use tools for data analysis, have limited broad exploration of the available data, often separating experimental biologists and domain experts from directly exploring relationships within the data. More than 15 years ago, we began development of MeV, a freely-available, open source software tool for intuitive analysis of genomic data. The simple graphical user interface and the extensive library of state-of-the- art analytical methods made MeV one of the most widely used software tools in bioinformatics, with nearly 260,000 downloads since we began keeping statistics in 2008 and downloads of nearly 30,000 per year for the past few years. Despite the success of MeV and its continued use, we recognized that large-scale, multi-omic data sets can no longer be analyzed easily using a desktop application. To keep pace with the data, we needed to develop a new platform that draws on modern computing technologies, including cloud-based computing and scalable data storage. The solution, funded by the NCI through the ITCR program (5U01CA151118), is a cloud-based, web- enabled version of MeV (WebMeV; http://mev.tm4.org). WebMeV uses Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and its Compute Engine infrastructure to leverage cloud-computing resources for analyzing large public genomic data sets. In April 2016, we released a robust version of WebMeV and have seen use of the system grow dramatically. The system has already been used to perform more than 350,000 analyses; WebMeV currently performing more than 100 analyses per day, 3,735 users who have registered with the system and that group is growing by 400 per month (registration is not required). To ensure wide use, we have done numerous online tutorials, including two “sold out” tutorials for intramural investigators at the NCI where WebMeV has become a critical tool for genomic analysis. In this application, we propose to continue to maintain and improve WebMeV, to expand its capabilities by implementing methods for network inference and representation, to integrate with the Cancer Genomics Cloud Pilots program, and to implement methods that can advance reproducible research.",2019-09-01T12:09:00Z,2024-08-31T12:08:00Z,PAR-15-333,nofo_PAR15-333,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,BOSTON,MA,UNITED STATES,itcr
U24CA231858,Penn Quantitative MRI Resource for Pancreatic Cancer,"Project Summary Preclinical quantitative imaging (QI) and mouse tumor models bridge the gap between the discovery of new therapeutic targets and the ultimate proof of their efficacy in cancer patients. The Penn Quantitative MRI Resource for Pancreatic Cancer aims to standardize quantitative imaging methods optimized for biologically relevant mouse models to accelerate the development of novel therapies for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA). PDA is featured by a dense stroma, which constitutes a unique tumor microenvironment that resists drug penetration and is immune suppressive. Successful stroma-directed interventions can be a vital part of effective PDA management. Although several stroma-directed drugs are being examined in the clinic, QI markers are not available for evaluating stroma responses in mice or patients. We have identified translational motion sensitive MRI markers which can detect changes of the tumor microenvironment, and we propose to examine their utility for stroma-directed interventions. However the preclinical imaging techniques are suboptimal for studying orthotopic tumors in locations susceptible to respiratory/cardiac motion such as the pancreas. Importantly, the motion-robust imaging must be achieved simultaneously with adequate temporal resolution required by the dynamic imaging protocol, the spatial resolution required to resolve the small size targets. Our prior success in the development and optimization of preclinical and clinical MRI methodology provides a roadmap to accomplish the mission of optimizing the preclinical motion-sensitive MRI techniques to match the advanced clinical benchmarks. Our Resource will leverage the substantial institutional resources including the Mouse Hospital of PENN Pancreatic Cancer Center, which provides the genetically engineered mouse (GEM) models of PDA credentialed for studying stroma-directed interventions. The strong collaboration with our industrial partner has led to the design of a co-clinical trial that includes a prospective phase-II clinical trial and a preclinical trial, where the utility of QI markers will be tested in both patients and mice responding to the same treatment of an investigational stromal drug. A multi-expertise team and an Advisory committee will join force to achieve the technical transformation, conduct the co-clinical trial and build the Resource web-portal to disseminate all workflow documents, research tools and QA/QC phantoms and to share the novel data content.",2018-09-14T12:09:00Z,2024-08-31T12:08:00Z,PAR-16-385,nofo_PAR-16-385,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,PHILADELPHIA,PA,UNITED STATES,cirp
U24CA231877,A Federated Galaxy for user-friendly large-scale cancer genomics research,"Project Summary Cancer research is now a data-driven discipline, but only a minority of cancer researchers are data scientists. This severely restricts our ability to effectively study and cure the disease. The far reaching significance of our project is in federating disparate data and computational resources in order to provide a unifying analysis platform for computational cancer research. We will extend the popular scientific workbench Galaxy (https://galaxyproject.org) so that it can integrate with distributed data and compute resources used and needed by cancer researchers, including those resources in the NCI Cancer Research Data Commons (NCR DC). Our Federated Galaxy system will allow users to seamlessly access NCR DC data across multiple resources. It will support multiple analysis scenarios tuned to skills and computational requirements of individual researchers. The aims of this project are: Aim 1. Extend Galaxy for working with distributed cancer genomics and phenotypic data. This will enable Galaxy users to access both public and private cancer data regardless of their actual physical location. Best-practice approaches will be used for accessing restricted datasets. Aim 2. Enhance Galaxy for context-aware, distributed cancer genomics analyses using shared workflow representations. This will enable Galaxy users to run genomics analyses on different clouds, ultimately reducing the time, cost, and data transfer associated with analyses. Aim 3. Apply Federated Galaxy to precision oncology research. Workflows developed in this aim will leverage the technologies in Aims 1 and 2 to benchmark machine learning algorithms for predicting tumor phenotype and drug response. Interactive reports will summarize benchmarking results and utilize ITCR visualizations for deep dives into results. Our system will provide a singular access point to distributed cancer datasets and will enable these data to be analyzed within a single portal in a way that satisfies multiple analysis scenarios and utilizes diverse computational resources. Finally, a cloud-centric Galaxy built for the NCR DC will substantially grow the community of users working with the GDC and the NCR DC. This is because Galaxy brings with itself a vibrant world-wide community of users and developers, which numbers tens of thousands of scientists. These individuals will help to tune the GDC and other resources within the NCR DC to the needs of real-life analysis scenarios and will enrich the set of tools accessible to cancer researchers.",2018-09-11T12:09:00Z,2023-08-31T12:08:00Z,PAR-15-331,nofo_PAR15-331,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,PORTLAND,OR,UNITED STATES,itcr
U24CA232979,Immuno-Oncology Translation Network: Data Management and Resource-Sharing Center at RPCI,"Project Summary While several innovative and creative immuno-oncology (IO) strategies have shown promising results, a significant expansion of their clinical use will require collaborative efforts to elucidate the resistance mechanism, discover new immune targets, identify predictive biomarkers, evaluate combination therapies, and develop preventive approaches. Utilizing a multi-disciplinary team approach, we will support Immuno-Oncology Translation Network (IOTN)-funded components to discover new immune targets and evaluate novel immune- based therapies and combination approaches that eliminate established cancers in adults or to prevent cancers before they occur. Our DMRC strategy is to serve as an administrative and analytic hub at every step of the IOTN's translational studies, focusing to reduce the barrier for access to analytic expertise, improve the productivity of IOTN investigators, maintain a high standard for data collection and management, design and perform rigorous analytical strategies, and foster a collaborative and supportive research community. An experienced, multidisciplinary team has been assembled to pursue four specific aims: First, we will provide a centralized administration infrastructure to coordinate IOTN activities, building upon the NRG Oncology Statistical and Data Coordinating Center's experience of coordinating over 450 translational cancer studies across hundreds of participating sites. Second, we will provide multidisciplinary analytic expertise to support IOTN collaborative research, leveraging five of RPCI CCSG's shared resources: Biostatistics, Bioinformatics, Biomedical Data Science, Data Bank and BioRepository, and Immune Analysis. Our analytic support will be armed with professional IT staff and informed by an experienced IO researcher team. Third, we will develop innovative data integration methods to enhance IOTN research capacity, capitalizing on the well-respected Bioconductor project and the independent research programs of the RPCI department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics. Fourth, we will actively promote the IOTN and engage in trans-consortium interactions, where we will leverage Bioconductor's decade-long experience in community engagement and the NRG data center's rich expertise in project coordination. Leveraging our active NCI-funded RPCI-committed resource to support the proposed multi-institutional trans-disciplinary IO research is not only cost-effective, but also flexible in its study-dependent scalability. Taken together, we envision that our DMRC, in close collaboration with the IOTN, will allow us to conduct highly effective and innovative translational studies to address the significantly unmet clinical needs related to IO.",2018-09-30T12:09:00Z,2024-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-17-047,nofo_RFA-CA-17-047,ROSWELL PARK CANCER INSTITUTE CORP,BUFFALO,NY,UNITED STATES,iotn

As the CC, RTI will provide scientific expertise and logistical support to create a cohesive research group that will develop the evidence base to increase CRC screening, diagnosis, and referral-to-care among populations who currently have low rates of screening. Specifically, we will (1) enhance productivity of ACCSIS Program members and stakeholders by providing necessary logistical, communications, and operational support; (2) support the generation of the evidence base on multilevel interventions to increase CRC screening by establishing common data elements and harmonized data collection procedures across research projects; (3) identify and support locally-developed innovative approaches to accelerate the evaluation of additional promising interventions to increase CRC screening; and (4) generate a user-friendly data repository and disseminate program findings to facilitate the adaption and scale-up of successful interventions. RTI has specific strengths that will enhance the scientific productivity of the program, including the following six. (1) We will use previously tested procedures and policies, based on our experience as the CC for more than 35 multisite projects, to enhance coordination among ACCSIS studies. (2) Our team, led by Dr. Sujha Subramanian, has more than a decade of experience in CRC screening studies, and will be supported by a multidisciplinary team of experts in implementation science, heath systems and community clinical linkages, heath disparities, multisite data collection, biostatistics, ethics and health data regulations, web design, data repository management, and dissemination. (3) We will enhance existing frameworks for common data collection that we have developed through our partnership with more than 40 CRC implementation programs by expanding the frameworks to include moderators and mediators. Expansion will allow us to understand the underlying pathways at each level of the intervention (patient, provider, and organization or community). (4) We will draw upon our ready-built network of CRC stakeholders to incorporate lessons learned from prior implementation studies and to identify locally-developed innovative approaches. (5) We will leverage internal expertise in implementation science methods and conduct mixed analysis using both quantitative and qualitative data to perform a comprehensive assessment of the cross- site findings from the multilevel interventions.

U24CA237617,Developing Informatics Technologies to Model Cancer Gene Regulation,"PROJECT SUMMARY How trans-acting factors regulate genome-wide gene expression in cancer is poorly understood, motivating an increasing number of ChIP-seq, DNase-seq, and ATAC-seq (simplified as “cistrome”) experiments to map genome-wide transcription factor binding sites and chromatin status. Significant biological insights have been gained through the computational analysis of cistrome data, especially when integrated with other published cistrome and gene expression data sets. However, most cancer biologists find computational data analysis and integration of cistrome and epigenome data to be the single most limiting bottleneck in their cancer gene regulation studies due to the lack of informatics expertise and computational infrastructure relative to the extraordinary volume of publicly available data. We have previously developed Cistrome Analysis Pipeline (AP) and Cistrome Data Browser (DB) to overcome this challenge. The objective of this proposal is to expand the functionality of Cistrome AP and DB to improve the collection, management, analysis, integration, visualization, and dissemination of cistrome and related data types. A flexible and intuitive user experience will empower experimental cancer biologists to create more insightful models of transcriptional and epigenetic gene regulation in cancer research. Specifically, we propose to improve and extend our existing Cistrome Analysis Pipeline (http://cistrome.org/ap) and Cistrome Data Browser (http://cistrome.org/db) infrastructure and interface by developing informatics technologies that address four critical aspects of cistrome data analysis. First, we will design, develop, and deploy software through a user-friendly interface to improve automated data collection, processing, and annotation. This will enable unpublished and public cistrome data to be jointly analyzed and converted into formats and statistical expressions that can be used for integrative analysis. Second, we will develop methods to use all available cistrome data to impute TF binding/cell-type combinations that are not represented in public repositories. Third, we will develop systems to allow gene expression data to be integrated with cistrome data to elucidate regulatory mechanisms. Fourth, we will develop interactive web based tools for the visualization of hundreds of cistrome samples at multiple resolutions. Finally, we will engage in outreach activities to improve improve Cistrome functions, user interface, interoperability with other tools, and promote the Cistrome data use in cancer research.",2019-03-15T12:03:00Z,2024-02-29T12:02:00Z,PAR-15-331,nofo_PAR15-331,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,BOSTON,MA,UNITED STATES,itcr
U24CA237683,University of Michigan Quantitative Co-Clinical Imaging Research Resource,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Quantitative imaging methods to detect cancer and assess response to therapy are cornerstones of pre-clinical drug development, clinical trials, and patient care. Success of quantitative imaging in oncology relies on standardization of protocols for image acquisition and analysis to ensure reproducibility within a single site over time and across institutions for multi-site clinical trials. Work by our group and others in the Quantitative Imaging Network and Quantitative Imaging Biomarkers Alliance continues to advance standardization procedures for clinical imaging. However, similar rigor has not been applied to pre-clinical imaging studies of cancer therapy in mice. The disconnect between standardization and validation methods incorporated into imaging studies for humans versus mice contributes to ongoing challenges with reproducibility in drug development and successful translation of new drugs to clinical medicine. To ensure direct, quantitative comparisons between pre-clinical and clinical imaging, we will establish a resource for quantitative MRI of bone marrow composition and architecture in myelofibrosis (MF), a chronic hematologic cancer marked by progressive fibrosis and destruction of bone marrow. This resource will extend quantitative imaging into hematologic cancers, a group of malignancies understudied and underserved by imaging because current methods generate largely qualitative data that cannot be used reliably as biomarkers for response to therapy. We will analyze key metrics of bone marrow disease using FDA-approved MRI sequences included in standard software packages for pre-clinical 7T and clinical 3T scanners: 1) bone marrow composition and cellularity (quantitative Dixon technique for fat/water); 2) replacement of normal bone marrow cells and bone trabecula (mobility of water (diffusion, DWI)); and 3) extent and severity of fibrosis (magnetization transfer (MT)). As part of standardization procedures for both mouse and human imaging, we will measure repeatability of imaging data using phantoms for each MRI sequence and test/retest imaging procedures for mouse and human subjects to establish confidence intervals. We also will standardize workflow for quantifying bone marrow MRI data with parametric response mapping (PRM), a voxel-wise image processing method we devised to capture spatial and temporal heterogeneity of imaging data during treatment. After establishing standard operating procedures for quantitative bone marrow MRI (Aim 1), we will apply these methods to co-clinical trials with standard-of-care and investigational therapies for MF, matching driver mutations for MF present in our patient population with our mouse model (Aim 2). To disseminate these methods to the imaging community, we will post standard operating procedures for MRI protocols, mouse models of MF, and PRM of bone marrow MRI data (Aim 3). We also will deposit curated imaging data in the TCIA, enabling other investigators to mine these data and test new hypotheses. Overall, this resource will reduce variability in quantitative bone marrow MRI in both mice and humans, improving the ability to reliably implement these imaging biomarkers to advance co-clinical trials and drug development MF and likely other hematologic malignancies.",2019-09-01T12:09:00Z,2024-08-31T12:08:00Z,PAR-18-841,nofo_PAR-18-841,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,ANN ARBOR,MI,UNITED STATES,cirp
U24CA237719,Standardized and Genome-Wide Clinical Interpretation of Complex Genotypes for Cancer Precision Medicine,"Project Summary/Abstract High-throughput molecular profiling technologies have allowed the systematic identification of molecular drivers of cancer for most major tumor types. Clinical and functional studies have correlated these drivers with patient outcomes and helped develop targeted therapies. However, maintaining current and comprehensive interpretations of the clinical significance of variants represents a major bottleneck. To address this challenge, the Clinical Interpretations of Variants in Cancer knowledgebase (CIViC; ​civicdb.org​) was created to provide a knowledge repository and sophisticated curation interface for expert-crowdsourcing the curation of actionable cancer variants. Importantly, all data are made freely available with a public domain license, daily and monthly data freezes, and public API. This has allowed widespread adoption of CIViC variant interpretations into many research tools for variant annotation as well as commercial and non-commercial report generation workflows. To date, these have focused predominantly on small mutations, detected through targeted sequencing panels, and assumed a single-target-to-single-therapy paradigm. As sequencing costs decrease, whole genome, transcriptome, and epigenome approaches will replace these targeted methods. This will allow increasingly unbiased assay of molecular alterations of most types (large and small) and will simultaneously replace many traditional cytogenetic assays. It will also dramatically increase the number of variants of potential and unknown clinical significance. Furthermore, our understanding has evolved to recognize that spatial and temporal tumor heterogeneity result in complex tumor genotypes of collaborating mutations that will require a more sophisticated decision support framework. To address these challenges, the CIViC data model will be extended to support: new frameworks for representing complex tumor genotypes; ACMG and AMP guidelines for both germline and somatic variant curation; and new evidence codes for assessing somatic variant oncogenicity. New user interfaces will be developed to support curation, browsing and searching of these features. Clinical collaborations will be extended to: (a) develop a distributable clinical-grade (CLIA-certified) analysis platform for comprehensive genomic profiling of patient samples using whole-genome sequencing; (b) support standardized somatic variant curation through the ClinGen Somatic Working group; and (c) integrate CIViC reports into the Personalized Oncogenomics (POG) trial. The proposal will address several key challenges including: 1) understanding the importance of integrating germline annotations with somatic cancer variant interpretations; 2) determining if a whole genome approach can replace existing targeted sequencing panels and cytogenetic assays; and 3) assessing the impact of a public variant interpretation knowledgebase on clinical decisions at molecular tumor board meetings. Finally, community outreach and training will be performed to develop online workshops, improve internship opportunities, and increase interaction with medical genetics fellows to train the next-generation of researchers in precision medicine informatics.",2019-04-02T12:04:00Z,2024-03-31T12:03:00Z,PAR-15-331,nofo_PAR15-331,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,SAINT LOUIS,MO,UNITED STATES,itcr
U24CA242637,CP-CTNet Coordinating Center,"Project Summary/Abstract Cancer is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the US and in the world. One approach to reducing the risk and burden of cancer is to use preventive agents and interventions that are effective and safe. According to the Division of Cancer Prevention (DCP) at the National Cancer Institute (NCI), this requires the systematic development of cancer preventive agents and interventions, with three critical components; i) preclinical/toxicology studies for identification of agents, ii) early phase trials of identified agents and other promising interventions, and iii) late phase III trials of preventive agents and interventions that have successfully passed through early phase trials, in a three-legged approach. The goal of the Cancer Prevention Clinical Trials Network (CP-CTNet) is to identify safe and effective preventive agents and interventions in order to advance their further clinical development for cancer prevention. Further clinical development is to be undertaken in late phase III trials conducted by the third leg, i.e. the National Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP), supported by the DCP's Community Oncology and Prevention Trials Research Group, to ultimately reduce the risk and burden of cancer. As the second leg of this three-legged approach, the CP-CTNet will conduct early phase trials to assess the safety, tolerability, and cancer preventive potential of agents and interventions of varying classes identified by the first leg, i.e. the DCP's Cancer Preclinical Drug Development Program (PREVENT) support of preclinical/toxicology studies, many of which target molecules or processes known to be important during carcinogenesis. The CP- CTNet Sites will perform these early phase trials supported by the DCP and the CP-CTNet Data Management, Auditing, and Coordinating Center (DMACC). These trials include phase 0 (micro-dosing), phase I (dose- finding), and phase II (preliminary efficacy) clinical trials. To support these early phase trials, which will be conducted by the CP-CTNet sites alone or as cross-Network trials, the CP-CTNet DMACC will coordinate trans-Network activities and provide expertise and resources in 1) centralized data management and reporting, 2) clinical trials auditing, and 3) administrative and logistical coordination, including expertise in clinical trials methodology and biostatistics, across CP-CTNet. In addition, the CP-CTNet DMACC will provide an advisory role in early phase caner prevention trial development for all CP-CTNet trials and the primary statistical role for cross-Network trials.",2019-09-20T12:09:00Z,2024-07-31T12:07:00Z,RFA-CA-18-030,nofo_CA-18-030,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,MADISON,WI,UNITED STATES,cp_ctnet
U24CA247643,PITT-CAL ETCTN PK Resource Laboratory,"SUMMARY The purpose of this U24 Cooperative Agreement is to support a consortium of two National Cancer Institute (NCI)-Designated Comprehensive Cancer Center-funded pharmacokinetic (PK) core labs that have joined together as a consolidated, integrated PK resource for the NCI Experimental Therapeutics-Clinical Trials Network (ETCTN). The UPMC Hillman Cancer Center (HCC) Cancer Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics Facility and City of Hope (COH) Analytical Pharmacology Core Facility are nationally recognized for their leadership in the pharmacological characterization of anticancer agents. The newly formed PITT-CAL ETCTN PK Resource Laboratory (PITT-CAL) proposes to systematically evaluate the ADME profiles of CTEP agents in various phases of clinical development through the accomplishment of the following objectives: (1) To apply pharmacology expertise to the ETCTN early drug development efforts by assisting in study design and other PK-related activities; (2) To analyze biological samples with quantitative assays; and (3) To perform non-compartmental, compartmental, and population PK analyses and report the results to study teams and CTEP in a timely manner. Our approach will be to use our technical and scientific expertise to lead all PK-related activities and integrate these PK investigations with the other clinical and correlative studies performed during the drug development process. We will develop, validate, and implement accurate, precise, and sensitive assays for study drugs and metabolites in plasma, tissues and other biological samples, and analyze clinical samples from the ETCTN LOAs. Lastly, we will derive PK parameters to characterize the ADME of agents in ETCTN trials, integrate these results with pharmacodynamic measures of drug response and report to CTEP and the clinical team to optimally inform ongoing and future development of CTEP agents and their combinations.",2020-05-15T12:05:00Z,2026-04-30T12:04:00Z,RFA-CA-19-008,nofo_CA19-008,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,PITTSBURGH,PA,UNITED STATES,etctn

The ChOP-KC consists of the Johns Hopkins University Analytical Pharmacology Core, The Ohio State University Pharmacoanalytical Shared Resource, and the University of Maryland Center for Translational Medicine. The ChOP-KC was formed to maximize expertise, infrastructure, and capabilities and to ensure adequate capacity to achieve the goal of providing world-class bioanalytical and clinical pharmacology support to the ETCTN, including analysis of up to approximately 7,500 pharmacokinetic (PK) specimens per year. We have assembled an interactive team of highly collaborative clinical and translational pharmacologists (Drs. Michelle Rudek (mPI), Sharyn Baker (mPI), Mitch Phelps and Alex Sparreboom), pharmacometricians (Drs. Phelps and Joga Gobburu), and statistician (Dr. Gary Rosner) that have a solid foundation in anticancer drug development. We will utilize our extensive pharmacology experience to support the ETCTN with study design, assay development, generation, analysis, and interpretation of high-quality data to enhance efficient evaluation and development of novel cancer therapies and to positively impact the clinical care of cancer patients. The ChOP-KC is experienced in providing clinical pharmacology and drug development support during the conduct of early phase clinical trials and has an extensive track-record of collaboration within various NCI Cooperative Agreements funded entities, including the ETCTN (UM1CA186691 and UM1CA186712) and associated Project Teams, AIDS Malignancy Consortium (UM1CA121947), and the Adult Brain Tumor Consortium (UM1CA137443), in addition to supporting investigator-initiated trials and non-clinical cancer drug development at their respective institutions and nationally. Specific Aims are: 1) To provide state-of-the-art, Good Laboratory Practice (GLP)-quality evaluations to quantitate anticancer drugs and metabolites in biological fluids; 2) To contribute collaboratively and actively in the NCI ETCTN by providing clinical pharmacology expertise to develop clinical trial protocols; and 3) To provide pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data analysis and interpretation to support decision-making for safe and efficient clinical drug development.

U24CA248010,Cancer Deep Phenotype Extraction from Electronic Medical Records,"Summary Precise phenotype information is needed to advance translational cancer research, particularly to unravel the effects of genetic, epigenetic, and systems changes on tumor behavior and responsiveness. Examples of phenotypic variables in cancer include: tumor morphology (e.g. histopathologic diagnosis), co-morbid conditions (e.g. associated immune disease), laboratory findings (e.g. gene amplification status), specific tumor behaviors (e.g. metastasis) and response to treatment (e.g. effect of a chemotherapeutic agent on tumor). Current models for correlating EMR data with –omics data largely ignore the clinical text, which remains one of the most important sources of phenotype information for cancer patients. Unlocking the value of clinical text has the potential to enable new insights about cancer initiation, progression, metastasis, and response to treatment. We propose further collaboration to enhance the DeepPhe platform with new methods for cancer deep phenotyping. Several aims propose investigation of biomedical information extraction where there has been little or no previous work (e.g. clinical genomic). Visualization of extracted data, usability of the software, and dissemination are also emphasized. A diverse set of oncology studies led by accomplished translational investigators in Breast Cancer, Melanoma, Ovarian Cancer, Colorectal Cancer and Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma will demonstrate the utility of the software. These labs will contribute phenotype variables for extraction, test utility and usability of the software, and provide the setting for an extrinsic evaluation. The proposed research bridges novel methods to automate cancer deep phenotype extraction from clinical text with emerging standards in phenotype knowledge representation and NLP. This work is highly aligned with recent calls in the scientific literature to advance scalable and robust methods of extracting and representing phenotypes for precision medicine and translational research.",2020-09-24T12:09:00Z,2025-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-19-040,nofo_RFA-CA-19-040,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,BOSTON,MA,UNITED STATES,itcr
U24CA248138,THE CANCER EPITOPE DATABASE AND ANALYSIS RESOURCE,"ABSTRACT Recent years have witnessed a dramatic rise in interest towards cancer epitopes in general, and neoepitopes that encompass mutations arising in a given tumor in particular. Current lines of research examine how the epitope load in a given tumor relates to the success of checkpoint blockade treatments, and how to utilize epitope-based vaccines and adoptive transfer of epitope-specific T cells for personalized therapies. For these purposes, neoepitopes that are recurrently recognized in different individuals are of particular interest, which has also re-ignited interest in epitopes identified in classic tumor-associated antigens. Along with the interest in cancer epitopes, there is also interest in the TCRs and BCRs specifically recognizing them, as these have the potential to be used in therapeutic approaches, and they can aid in basic studies to infer the specificity of T cells or B cells characterized in single cell sequencing data. This resurgence of interest in epitopes has created a need to catalog and make accessible to the scientific community all epitope data, also linked to the biological, immunological, and clinical contexts. The ultimate goal is to come “full circle” and link epitope recognition and immunological readouts to clinical outcomes and treatment strategies alike. In parallel, there is an urgent need to develop resources for epitope prediction and analysis tools that provide access to predictive strategies and provide objective evaluations of their performance in the relevant biological, immunological, and clinical contexts. Recent years have also witnessed the publication of multiple original methodologies that reported sometimes impressive gains in the predictions of cancer epitopes. However, several of these studies were difficult to evaluate, because the methodologies and/or datasets were not fully available in a format that was readily executable. As a result, their performance could not be properly benchmarked on independent datasets. This is also because effective benchmarking on independent datasets requires the assembly of novel datasets of sufficient size and diversity. To overcome all of these information technology challenges, we propose to design and implement the Cancer Epitope Database and Analysis Resource (CEDAR), which will provide a freely accessible, comprehensive collection of cancer epitope and receptor data curated from the literature, and provide easily accessible epitope and TCR/BCR target prediction and analysis tools. As the cancer epitope data are curated, they will be used as a transparent benchmark of how well prediction tools perform, and also to develop new prediction tools for the analysis resource component of CEDAR. CEDAR will leverage our expertise from developing the Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource (IEDB), which is fully operational and widely used by researchers globally. CEDAR will directly complement other projects currently funded through the NIH ITCR program that provide resources and tools related to cancer omics data. Finally, we will engage in outreach activities to improve functions, user interfaces, and interoperability with other ITCR tools and promote the use of CEDAR in cancer research.",2021-05-05T12:05:00Z,2026-04-30T12:04:00Z,RFA-CA-20-009,nofo_RFA-CA-20-009,LA JOLLA INSTITUTE FOR IMMUNOLOGY,LA JOLLA,CA,UNITED STATES,itcr
U24CA248265,Advancing method benchmarking and data sharing through crowd-sourced competitions in cancer research,"Project Summary/Abstract Crowd-sourced competitions have transformed biomedical research by incentivizing the coalescence of communities around timely and difficult problems. These communities have created new standards and benchmarks, and developed innovative solutions to dozens of pressing research problems. The Dialogue on Reverse Engineering Assessment and Methods (DREAM) Challenges is a leader in generating communities through these crowd-sourced competitions. DREAM is an open science, collaborative competition framework that allows participants from around the world to work together to solve fundamental biomedical questions. Its vision is to allow open collaboration amongst individuals and groups, maximizing societal impact through the “wisdom of the crowd”. Over the past 13 years DREAM Challenges have developed key biomarkers and benchmarks for cancer research, fostering the development of innovative methods, the objective assessment of tools and algorithms, the development of community standards, and greater access to critical data sets. To enable the next generation of Challenges, we propose to expand our existing infrastructure into an innovative platform for rapid, rigorous and scientifically-valid Challenge-based assessments. We propose to create a Challenge framework that (1) provides a discovery engine for biomedical Challenges and their outputs, (2) contains innovative tools that enhance and streamline Challenges, and (3) is scaleable and supports distributed assessments using private and sensitive data. These will be married to a suite of educational tools, instructions, best-practices guidelines, and workshops and conferences to expand the solver community and support the organization of independent challenges to maximize impact on biomedical research.

U24CA248453,Comprehensive and Robust Tools for Analysis of Tumor Heterogeneity and Evolution,"Project Summary/Abstract In recent years, precision medicine approaches based on molecular changes in an individual patient’s tumor have become a promising strategy for diagnosis and treatment of cancer. These approaches are challenged by the fact that tumors are a heterogeneous collection of cells that change over time and in response to treatment. At the DNA sequence level, changes range in scale from single-nucleotide mutations to large chromosomal rearrangements and whole-genome duplications. New DNA/RNA sequencing technologies enable measurement of this heterogeneity and provide data to infer the evolutionary history of a tumor. However, the algorithms and software necessary to analyze the complexities of tumor heterogeneity and evolution remain limited in scope. We propose to develop a comprehensive software toolkit to analyze tumor heterogeneity and tumor evolution across space, time, and genomic scale. This toolkit will be based on advanced combinatorial and statistical algorithms developed by PI over the past several years. These algorithms will be unified into a robust, computationally efficient, and statistically sound software package. This toolkit will incorporate modules for different types of tumor samples including single tumor samples, multiple tumor regions, multiple anatomical sites (e.g. primary tumor and metastasis), and multiple time points. The software will also analyze data from different sequencing approaches (whole-genome, whole-exome, and targeted sequencing) and different sequencing technologies including bulk tumor, single-cell, short-read, and long-read. The software package will be open source and will be released to run on individual computers, computing clusters, or in cloud computing environments. Extensive documentation and training will be provided to facilitate use by a wide range of users from expert bioinformaticians to clinicians. These powerful data analytic tools will enable researchers to characterize the heterogeneity within tumors with high accuracy, enabling greater precision in cancer diagnosis and treatment.",2020-09-24T12:09:00Z,2025-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-19-040,nofo_RFA-CA-19-040,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,Princeton,NJ,UNITED STATES,itcr
U24CA248454,Advanced Development of Informatics Technologies for Cancer Research and Management (U24 Clinical Trial Optional),"In the past two decades, we have taken large strides towards understanding the role of the microbiota (the trillions of microorganisms inhabiting the human body) and the microbiome (their genes) in human health. Individual microbial or viral pathogens are implicated in the etiology of many cancers, including gastric, colon, and cervical cancer. Still more cancers likely arise from the interplay of many different microbial taxa, their metabolic activities, the host’s genotype and immune system activity, and factors such as host diet, current and former smoking status, and environmental exposures. We propose to advance cancer microbiome research through three specific aims. This work will be performed in the context of the popular QIIME 2 microbiome bioinformatics platform and the Qiita public microbiome data repository and pooled analysis system. In our first aim, we will improve access to cancer microbiome bioinformatics methods and data through the creation of a Galaxy interface for QIIME 2, improved support for working with QIIME 2 in the R programming language and Galaxy GUI ecosystem, popular for cancer research, the development of a resource for cancer microbiome pooled analysis, the development of a cancer- focused microbiome bioinformatics workshop series, and by making QIIME 2 and cancer microbiome data accessible from within the NCI Cloud Resources. Our second aim will develop a microbiome multi-omics bioinformatics platform driven by the needs of the cancer research community through creating QIIME 2 plugins for metabolomics, metatranscriptomics, metagenomics, and metaproteomics with developers working in these areas. Many important cancer microbiome projects have made advances by integrating these different data types, yet considerable technical hurdles remain to making microbiome multi-omics bioinformatics accessible by all researchers whose projects would benefit from these methods. To facilitate this, we will create a microbiome multi-omics bioinformatics developer conference, following the model of our recent Teaching and Developing QIIME 2 conference. Our third aim will improve the reproducibility of cancer microbiome bioinformatics methods, and the reliability of cancer microbiome bioinformatics results, by expanding several features related to tracking data provenance in QIIME 2, and helping users submit their microbiome multi-omics raw data to archival repositories. Much of this work will occur in collaboration with NCI Informatics Technology for Cancer Research (ITCR) and Cloud Resources project teams, several of whom we’re already beginning to collaborate with.",2020-07-15T12:07:00Z,2025-06-30T12:06:00Z,RFA-CA-19-040,nofo_RFA-CA-19-040,NORTHERN ARIZONA UNIVERSITY,FLAGSTAFF,AZ,UNITED STATES,itcr
U24CA248455,Advanced development of the Cancer Dependency Map portal (DepMap.org),"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: The ability to predict vulnerabilities given the molecular features of a patient’s tumor is central to operationalizing cancer precision medicine. While sequencing of patient tumors is increasingly common, researchers, clinicians, and drug developers currently lack the ability to identify which somatically altered genes and variants are required for tumor survival and/or confer a requirement for other genes (synthetic lethality). The “Cancer Dependency Map (DepMap)” project directly addresses this challenge. This effort, which continues to generate and release pre-publication data on a quarterly basis without restriction, currently encompasses over 1,000 genomically annotated cancer cell lines and organoid models, over 750 genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 viability screens, and large scale drug repurposing screens totaling over 1,000,000 data points. In addition, we have created a wide range of computational algorithms to discover dependencies and to infer them from molecular features. To ensure that the scientific community can easily use these data and tools to make scientific discoveries, we launched the pilot of depmap.org on April 2018. This pilot aimed to learn how best to support the analysis and visualization of such data (whether created at the Broad Institute or elsewhere) by researchers everywhere. The pilot proved to be a success: currently, depmap.org has 62,000 users and is visited by >800 unique researchers from >200 laboratories daily. Here, we propose the advanced development of depmap.org to address the emerging needs of distinct user communities: ● cancer biologists: use depmap.org to discover the function of genes and variants and how these induce network changes that result in vulnerabilities (users have limited programming experience, we will emphasize user experience, enabling the upload of researchers’ own data and the interoperability with other experimental research tools); ● translational cancer researchers: use depmap.org to prioritize new targets from CRISPR data and mechanism of action of existing drugs within specific tumor type contexts to advance drug discovery (users have limited programming experience, we will emphasize user experience and tumor-type functionality, connectivity with cBioPortal and patient data); ● computationalists: aim to develop new predictive modeling applications and data analysis tools that can be readily shared back with the depmap.org community (users have extensive programing experience, we will emphasize creating application programming interface (API) protocols and support sharing of new computational tools back with depmap.org) Our revised proposal focuses on three complementary Specific Aims: In Aim 1, we will develop new functionalities to support pre-defined scientific inquiries of cancer biologists and translational researchers. Here, we will (a) enable users to prioritize cancer targets via the integrated analysis of drug and CRISPR viability data, (b) create tools to connect patient tumors with cell models, (c) develop mechanism of action functionality and (d) support tumor- and genotype-specific inquiries. In Aim 2, we will develop new visualization and interactive analysis tools for cancer biologists and translational researchers as well as APIs for advanced computationalists. This will include data generated by multiple institutions as well as new functionality for interoperability with user uploaded data and APIs to export harmonized data for outside analysis. In Aim 3, we will develop a set of resources to train and engage a diverse user community. This work will include a major training and outreach program and real-time communication channels for user feedback and support. This ITCR proposal will put us on a path towards the routine use of depmap.org by a majority of cancer researchers worldwide. If funded, this proposal would represent the only dedicated source of funds to support the maintenance and expansion of this popular portal which simply cannot be sustained at the needed level without dedicated funding. As such, it will have a significant impact on both basic and translational cancer research and enable computationalists and biologists to continue to make key cancer discoveries.",2020-09-03T12:09:00Z,2025-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-19-040,nofo_RFA-CA-19-040,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",CAMBRIDGE,MA,UNITED STATES,itcr
U24CA248457,GenePattern and GenePattern Notebook: Integrative 'Omic Analysis for Cancer Research,"Project Summary Over the past two decades, the landscape of cancer research has changed with the explosion of publicly available and investigator generated datasets from evolving technology platforms, and the growing number of sophisticated computational methods and tools to integrate and analyze them. To move the cancer research agenda forward, the cancer research community needs a way to easily combine the right tools and methods to analyze and visualize all the data relevant to their studies, and reproducibly capture the history of what they have done. These objectives may be especially daunting for cancer biologists who don’t program. The GenePattern computational genomics environment has served cancer investigators since 2004 and was enhanced by GenePattern Notebook, released in 2017. The goal of this proposal is to continue to support, expand, and enhance the GenePattern ecosystem. Through these efforts we will continue to support a diverse community of users at the forefront of cancer research who seek to better understand the underlying mechanisms of disease, translate improved methods for patient diagnosis and prognosis to the clinic, and identify new drug targets. Aim 1. Ensure the GenePattern ecosystem continues to keep pace with new and emerging methods and technologies and the changing cancer research environment. To increase the range of methods and approaches available to the GenePattern community, we will provide seamless access to other popular ‘omic analysis packages (Cytoscape, Galaxy, IGV) within GenePattern Notebook, allowing the interleaving of methods from multiple packages within the same executable notebook. We will also provide support for querying and accessing data hosted on selected cancer-relevant data repositories. Aim 2. Continue to author and serve GenePattern notebooks for the cancer research community. We will develop 30-50 new high utility notebooks for the GenePattern-Notebook Workspace, leveraging Aim 1 as required, that provide users with guided, step-by-step execution of their integrative analysis. These will comprise data processing and analysis workflows, including approaches that bridge the gap from discovery to translation. Aim 3. Extend, maintain, and support the GenePattern ecosystem infrastructure. We will continue to support and enhance the GenePattern ecosystem, including enabling hosting on multiple cloud architectures and high- performance compute sites, and enhancing the Notebook user interface with high-value features. Aim 4. Provide outreach, training, and support to our user community. We will engage the cancer research community to continue to address their needs. A Scientific Advisory Board of cancer biologists and physician scientists will review progress and guide our strategy as we proceed. We will continue our high level of support and outreach for GenePattern and its notebook environment, including cancer-focused tutorials and training materials, in-person workshops, conference presentations, webinars, and social media vehicles and our responsive forum.

Cancer genomics has contributed to many advances in treating several cancers, but the field is limited by a lack of genomics data. The Participant Engagement and Cancer Genome Sequencing (PE-CGS) Network will promote and support research on direct participant engagement approaches to address these gaps, especially among rare cancers, highly lethal cancers, cancers with an early age of onset, cancers with high disparities in incidence/mortality, and cancers among under-represented minorities. Our team wishes to contribute to the important work of the (PE-CGS) Network by serving as its coordinating center. We have the necessary faculty, resources, and experience to address the needs and goals of the Network by supporting network coordination, promoting effective and equitable outreach and promotion, and establishing and disseminating network best practices. In addition to meeting all the requirements of the RFA, we bring innovation by establishing Participant Engagement Community (PEC) by applying the principles of community-based participatory research and by promoting a diverse pool of future scientists, especially those from underrepresented groups through a Summer Scholar Program and by two post-doctoral positions that will be supported by our comprehensive cancer center. Our proposal for the coordinating center is focused around four specific aims. First, we will effectively manage administrative and scientific coordination of the PE-CGS network. This will include providing administration/coordination, governing all advisory, organizing meetings/site visits, fostering collaboration, dissemination and implementation, and coordinating communication. Second, we will foster effective and culturally appropriate outreach and promotion activities. We will establish a common branded, public relations, communication resources, facilitating interactions, and managing outreach. Third, we will develop and disseminate network best practices and data collection/processing standards. We provide support for participant engagement and cancer genome sequencing activities, establish data standards, ensure data are accessible to the public, data are appropriately shared, and support efforts to make the Network sustainable. Finally, we want to address health disparities and promote equity throughout the Network and ensure there is a diverse pool of future scientists, including those from underrepresented groups, to support future efforts in participant engagement and cancer genomics. We envision that the network will need to evolve to address emerging issues in participant engagement and believe that being based in a university setting will provide us the capacity to anticipate and address these issues as they emerge. We are strongly supported by the OSU College of Medicine, the OSU Comprehensive Cancer Center, and the OSU Center for Clinical and Translational Science.",2020-08-12T12:08:00Z,2025-07-31T12:07:00Z,RFA-CA-19-046,nofo_CA19-046,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,COLUMBUS,OH,UNITED STATES,pe_cgs
U24CA253377,Co-Clinical Quantitative Imaging of Small Cell Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer Using Hyperpolarized 13C MRI,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The goal of this Oncology Co-Clinical Imaging Research Program (CIRP) proposal is to overcome the translational barrier, as stated in PAR-18-184, to develop co-clinical imaging research resources that will encourage a consensus on how quantitative imaging methods are optimized to improve the quality of imaging results for co-clinical trials. This will be accomplished by using novel quantitative metabolic preclinical hyperpolarized (HP) 13C magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to assess therapeutic response of small cell neuroendocrine (SCNC) prostate cancer (PCa). The murine imaging study will be conducted in parallel to a clinical trial (NCI R01 CA215694), aiming to assess response of SCNC to carboplatin in men with metastatic PCa, led by Drs. John Kurhanewicz and Rahul Aggarwal at UCSF. SCNC is an increasingly prevalent, lethal subtype of PCa that arises as an adaptive response to the application of androgen deprivation therapy and second-generation potent androgen pathway inhibitors. The selection of the most appropriate treatment of patients with metastatic SCNC is hindered by the fact that neither blood tests or current imaging modalities can reliably identify therapeutic efficacy in these metastatic tumors which are also often not amenable to biopsy. The study design of this U24 project incorporates the four key elements of CIRP: 1) The preclinical development and optimization of quantitative HP 13C MRI acquisition and data analysis methods that address the lack in rigor and reproducibility of existing preclinical and clinical approaches (aim 1); 2) The use of appropriate patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models that reflect the genetic, metabolic and micro-environmental heterogeneity of SCNC metastases in patients; 3) The application of the optimized preclinical dynamic HP 13C MRI protocols and data modeling approaches to study the response of metastatic bone and liver disease in the PDX models to chemotherapy, paralleling the funded study in patients (aim 2); and 4) The establishment of an online resource of quantitative HP 13C MRI imaging protocols, data analyses, modeling tools, correlative biology data for wider dissemination, validation and establishment of consensus by the scientific community (aim 3). To accomplish this important translational quantitative imaging project, we have assembled an exceptional team of basic science and clinical investigators with complimentary expertise in preclinical and clinical cancer research, realistic PDX models, HP 13C MRI, informatics, and in leading imaging and therapeutic clinical trials. This research project will also capitalize on the extensive resources provided by the NIH funded P41 Hyperpolarized Magnetic Resonance Technology Resource Center, the large number of preclinical and clinical DNP polarizers and 13C-enabled MRI scanners, and imaging informatics infrastructure which exist at UCSF. Although this proposal will focus on current standard of care treatment, the new quantitative HP 13C metabolic MRI approaches developed in this proposal will have general applicability for a variety of new targeted therapeutic approaches being developed for SCNC as well as for the study of other diseases.",2020-09-07T12:09:00Z,2025-08-31T12:08:00Z,PAR-18-841,nofo_PAR-18-841,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",SAN FRANCISCO,CA,UNITED STATES,cirp
U24CA253529,Overture: A Multi-Scale Data Platform for Cancer Genomics Research,"Project Summary/Abstract Overture is a collection of modular, open-source software components designed to make the management of big-data genomic projects both easy and more cost effective. The Overture system promotes FAIR data sharing of cancer genomic datasets by overcoming the major obstacles in storing, managing, exploring, and distributing massive genome-scale datasets. In this proposed project, we will implement a turnkey Overture Data Management System (DMS) to provide a complete solution to manage cancer genomic data throughout the data life cycle, and to continue lowering the technical barriers faced by researchers in the cancer informatics community. To extend the capabilities and potential of the Overture DMS, we will establish a new software framework for integration with third-party visualization applications, and for data exchange with analysis platforms. This framework will empower the community to continue developing extremely valuable visualization applications for specific research interests and datatypes, and to contribute them as “apps” to be integrated with the Overture DMS. Over the next five years, we will: (1) combine the core set of Overture components into a scalable DMS installation bundle to promote both local and cloud deployment for a range of small to consortia-scale datasets; (2) extend the DMS with third-party visualization and analysis tools through a novel software data integration framework; (3) enhance data access controls by implementing Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) Passport and Data Use Ontology standards; (3) enable federated searching within cancer datasets across different Overture platforms; and (4) improve outreach and community resources to meet the needs of bioinformaticians, data producers and managers, data scientists, and clinical researchers. The Overture DMS will be a valuable resource for removing complications of large-scale data management from researchers, allowing the advancement of scientific research by increasing data sharing and discovery.",2021-09-09T12:09:00Z,2026-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-20-009,nofo_RFA-CA-20-009,ONTARIO INSTITUTE FOR CANCER RESEARCH,TORONTO,ON,CANADA,itcr
U24CA253531,Development of an Open-Source Preclinical Imaging Informatics Platform for Cancer Research,"ABSTRACT Preclinical imaging is widely used in cancer research to devise novel tumor detection strategies, assess tumor burden and physiology/biology, as well as to validate novel therapeutic strategies and predictive and biomarkers of response to therapy. More recently, the use of patient-derived tumor xenografts (PDX) and genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) has ushered an era of co-clinical trials where preclinical studies can inform clinical trials, thus potentially bridging the translational gap in cancer research. However, differences in the deployment of the instruments, differences in imaging formats and protocols, differences in animal models, and variability in analytic pipelines among other factors result in non-tractable data and poor reproducibility. Importantly, current databases are not compatible with complexity and growing demands in preclinical cancer imaging which include big data needs and collection of metadata/annotation to support NCI’s precision medicine initiative. Thus, there is an unmet need to develop a unifying imaging informatics and workflow management platform to support cancer research, which will ultimately support the premise of translational precision medicine. We propose to develop an open-source preclinical imaging informatics platform—Preclinical Imaging XNAT- enabled Informatics (PIXI)—to manage the workflow of preclinical imaging laboratories, harmonize imaging databases, and enable deployment of analytic and computational pipelines in preclinical imaging. PIXI will be based on XNAT as the underlying informatics architecture. XNAT is used by over 200 academic institutions and industry entities as the backbone for data management across a wide range of imaging applications in clinical research, and thus offers a robust platform for the development and deployment of PIXI. Through this effort, we will 1) develop the PIXI database and server to capture preclinical imaging associated data, metadata, and preclinical imaging workflow and experiments; 2) develop the PIXI “point-of-service” interface, notebook capabilities, and software development kit (SDK); and 3) develop the PIXI container-based application (“App”) environment to implement portable analytic pipelines. Overall, the development of a preclinical imaging informatics platform is expected to have a profound impact on the management of preclinical imaging in cancer research which will ultimately support translational precision medicine.",2020-09-01T12:09:00Z,2025-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-19-040,nofo_RFA-CA-19-040,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,SAINT LOUIS,MO,UNITED STATES,itcr
U24CA253539,Patient Derived Cancer Model (PDCM) Finder,"Project Summary - Patient Derived Cancer Model (PDCM) Finder An area of significant growth in cancer research is the diversity and volume of low passage human cancer cell lines, three-dimensional organoid cultures and patient-derived tumor xenografts (PDX) known as Patient Derived Cancer Models (PDCM). This project will therefore aggregate, harmonize and integrate diverse PDCM data, extending our previous resource PDX Finder by inclusion of novel models, making these FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) compliant and cloud accessible, for example in the NCI Research Commons. PCDM Finder will address challenges with searching over many repositories for models, incompatible standards that make analysis and reuse of models difficult, molecular datasets annotated with insufficient information that prevent cloud-based analyses and the need for more community awareness in providing FAIR- compliant data to maximize the impact of their work. To address these challenges, PDCM Finder has 3 tasks: 1) Enable cancer researchers to Find and Access models by enhancing our current resource to deliver the PDCM Finder, 2) Aggregate and Integrate PDCM datasets to ensure Interoperability and Reusability for the NCI Cancer Research Commons, and 3) Perform targeted community outreach during all stages of the project to determine and prioritize requirements, guide development and promote the PDCM Finder resource. The expected outcomes are users will be able to find, group and locate PDCM models of all types based on community defined attributes (e.g. diagnosis, oncogenic mutation); explore and download molecular data summaries and drug response data from the PDCM portal; aggregate and analyze harmonized PDCM molecular datasets on cloud based analysis platforms. This will accelerate cancer research by allowing doctors and researchers to find PDCM data that best matches their patients and/or research questions and explore new therapeutic avenues for patients.",2020-09-10T12:09:00Z,2025-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-19-040,nofo_RFA-CA-19-040,EUROPEAN MOLECULAR BIOLOGY LABORATORY,HEIDELBERG,,GERMANY,itcr
U24CA258393,OpenCRAVAT: Informatics Tools for High-Throughput Analysis of Cancer Mutations,"PROJECT SUMMARY Cancer sequencing projects have identified a very large number of DNA mutations whose importance in cancer is not yet understood. To better understand the impact of these mutations, our team has produced a software tool for computational analysis of cancer mutations that can analyze millions of mutations at one time. This tool works as a funnel to help researchers to find the small number of mutations that are most likely to be informative from the very large number of mutations discovered in a sequencing project. The software allows users to design ways to combine multiple mutation evaluation metrics, and generate a prioritized list of mutations that are more likely to be biologically important. These evaluation metrics include the molecular consequence, bioinformatic scores to identify pathogenic and driver mutations, frequency of the mutation in human populations, previous occurrence in tumor tissue types, pointers to literature, and visualization of annotated protein structures and networks. A web-based version of the pipeline - Cancer Related Analysis of Variants Toolkit (CRAVAT) has been widely adopted (3000+ jobs submitted/month on average in 2020). We have attracted a user community that spans both basic and clinical cancer researchers, all of whom rely on high-throughput tumor sequencing in their work. In 2019, we introduced OpenCRAVAT, which is distinguished by an open source codebase and an open app store of tools and resources that can be used to better understand the importance and impact of mutations. The app store is driven by the user community; new apps are prioritized based upon user requests and the app store includes many apps that were contributed directly by outside tool developers. The app store currently aggregates tools from over 70 organizations, and these tools can be combined to identify mutations whose molecular impact contributes to tumorigenesis, prognosis and treatment selection. Initial adoption of our OpenCRAVAT tool is encouraging, with over 10,000 local package downloads in the first two years. We expect that OpenCRAVAT will be adopted by a much larger community, given the increasing importance of DNA sequencing data in cancer research. We will continue to ensure that our tools are interoperable with other informatics tools and services, and can be run in different computational environments such as cloud computing and local installation to maintain data privacy.",2022-05-15T12:05:00Z,2027-04-30T12:04:00Z,RFA-CA-21-015,nofo_RFA-CA-21-015,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,BALTIMORE,MD,UNITED STATES,itcr
U24CA258406,The Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) for Cancer Research,"Project Summary/Abstract Driven by new and emerging technologies for data acquisition, integrative genomic studies are revolutionizing the way we approach the study of cancer and charting the way to novel treatment regimens. They require the high-throughput generation and analysis of multiple and often complex types of genomic data. To address this challenge, and in active collaboration with end users, we developed, and released in 2008, a broadly applicable Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV). IGV is an interactive, high-performance, user-friendly tool launched millions of times a year by investigators and clinicians worldwide. The goal of this project is to ensure that IGV continues to track and respond to advances in genomics technology and changing user needs, and maintains its high level of utility for the cancer research community. We will accomplish this through our three specific aims. Aim 1. Evolve IGV to keep pace with the needs of the cancer genomics community. We will continue to evolve IGV to leverage recent and future advances in genomics technologies and methods that are key to moving cancer research and treatment forward. We will add new visualizations and features to better enable interpretation and validation of complex variants from both short and long read data. Through collaborations with other projects we will add new capabilities to better assess and interpret single nucleotide and structural variants. Responding to IGV’s increased use for review of variants in patient tumors, we will enhance support for this task. Aim 2. Maintain IGV to ensure continued high levels of utility, usability, and reliability. We will continue to provide frequent software releases to address feature requests, bug reports, and other suggestions from IGV’s community of both users and developers. Based on community input, we will review the IGV user interface to improve usability. We will address the challenges and opportunities presented by the evolving computing and software technology environment. We will continue to maintain the code base and downloadable installers and update them for new releases of Java, JavaScript, external libraries, browsers, and operating systems. Aim 3. Support the IGV user and open-source developer communities. We will continue to provide a high level of support including rapid responses to help requests; in-depth documentation on software use; short videos to walk users through tasks with high utility; training materials and exercises. For our vibrant, open-source developer community that contributes to the IGV code base and uses IGV in their own applications or resources, support includes: documentation and code examples for integrating and extending IGV; guidance on new development through our GitHub forums; prompt review of contributions; and acknowledgement of their work. We have extensive software engineering experience, developing and distributing IGV and other software tools used by hundreds of thousands of biomedical researchers and clinicians worldwide. IGV’s success, user-driven development approach, collaborative tradition, and flexible architecture make us well poised to accomplish our aims to further transform data visualization and accelerate the pace of biomedical discovery.",2021-09-07T12:09:00Z,2026-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-20-010,nofo_RFA-CA-20-010,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",LA JOLLA,CA,UNITED STATES,itcr
U24CA258407,Enhance UCSC Xena: extend interactive visualization to ultra-large-scale multi-omics data and integrate with analysis resources,"Abstract Two significant paradigm shifts are underway in cancer genomics: single-cell genomic profiling and the growth of the NCI Cancer Research Data Commons. Single-cell genomics is transforming our understanding of complex tumor populations and revealing new insights into tumor composition, microenvironment, cancer stem cells, and drug resistance. Several large-scale, single-cell-focused, national and international projects are currently underway, including HCA, HTAN, and HuBMAP. Data generated by these projects will impact almost every aspect of biology and medicine. For these projects to realize their full potential, it is essential to have data visualization and analysis tools that make these resources accessible to a broad group of biomedical researchers. This is challenging, however, as existing data visualization and analysis tools simply cannot scale to handle these large datasets. The second paradigm shift is NCI’s development of the Cancer Research Data Commons (CRDC), a virtual data science infrastructure that connects cancer research data collections with analytical tools, leveraging the dynamic computing power of the cloud. Efficient and secure incorporation of widely-used 3rd party tools and platforms, including interactive visualization tools such as UCSC Xena, into CRDC is needed to make this resource truly useful. As both of these transitions continue to accelerate in the coming years, they present challenges and opportunities. We propose to enhance UCSC Xena to support and enable these transitions through four aims. Aim 1. We will scale up UCSC Xena by 100x to support the visualization of datasets with greater than 1 million cells (more generally, 1 million bio-entities) without any loss of data or interactivity in the web browser. We will employ several new advances in computer engineering to achieve this performance gain. In addition, we will develop three new visualizations to enable researchers to better explore single-cell data. Aim 2. We will securely integrate UCSC Xena with resources in the NCI CRDC and its community of data analysis tools and platforms. Our integration will make loading ending analysis results into a private Xena Hub in CRDC for visualization in the context of large public data a routine practice. Aim 3. We will provide visualization of the most current cancer genomics resource data through the expansion and update of UCSC Xena database with key projects and datasets. We will collaborate with the Treehouse Childhood Cancer Initiative to build a harmonized preclinical pediatric genomics data resource and make it publicly available on the Xena Browser. This work will leverage PDX models and brain tumor organoids currently being developed and profiled by Dr. Haussler’s group. Aim 4. We will improve user workflows and engagement through User Centered Design, as well as continue user education, support, and outreach.",2021-09-01T12:09:00Z,2026-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-20-009,nofo_RFA-CA-20-009,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA CRUZ,SANTA CRUZ,CA,UNITED STATES,itcr
U24CA258483,Sustaining the Integrative Imaging Informatics for Cancer Research (I3CR) Center,"Abstract Artificial intelligence (AI) and other computationally intensive methods have the potential to revolutionize cancer imaging research and patient care. The broad adoption of these technologies depends on the availability development of imaging informatics tools to assist users in managing massive data sets, generating well-curated annotations, and accessing scalable computing resources. The Integrative Imaging Informatics for Cancer Research (I3CR) Center has played a lead role in implementing cancer imaging informatics technology, with a focus on expanding the widely used open source XNAT informatics platform to better support computational workflows in cancer imaging. I3CR has also developed knowledge management tools to better track data processing and analysis, including tools for orchestrating and tracking container-based computing pipelines. As result of this work, XNAT has emerged as the most widely used imaging informatics platform in cancer research. It is deployed in over 200 organizations across academia and industry and has been adopted across a wide range of research contexts, including preclinical imaging, multi-site clinical trials, and clinical translation. As the I3CR informatics platform has matured and been widely adopted, the Center is now evolving to the next phase of development to more broadly sustain the platform. In the work proposed here, we will sustain the I3CR’s ongoing engineering initiatives and expand its outreach efforts. The Center’s sustainment activities will build on and extend the I3CR platform’s expansive set of data and knowledge management capabilities, with a focus on addressing key emergent needs within our user base. In Aim 1, we will continue to develop the XNAT-based data management platform, including adding standards-based clinical interfaces, developing a cohort discovery service with natural language processing support, implementing a task automation service, and extending its container-based computing service to support high performance computing and cloud computing environments. In Aim 2, we will implement a suite of integrations with complementary image analysis and data sharing platforms, including The Cancer Image Archive and the NCI Imaging Data Commons. In Aim 3, we will expand the I3CR’s outreach initiatives to ensure broad and effective adoption of the I3CR informatics platforms. The Center’s training program will utilize the XNAT Academy education platform to host a series of online training programs directed at specific audiences including developers, data scientists, integrators, and system administrators.

U24CA258511,Extensible Open Source Zero-Footprint Web Viewer for Cancer Imaging Research,"Project Summary/Abstract The Open Health Imaging Foundation (OHIF) Viewer and its underlying libraries such as Cornerstone have become the standard framework for web-based imaging informatics technologies in cancer research and beyond, supporting hundreds of open-source projects with thousands of users. Through OHIF, developers can: 1) add new innovative tools as extensions to the OHIF Viewer; 2) use specific OHIF modules or libraries to build their own custom tools; and 3) web-enable existing desktop informatics platforms. To support the transition from desktop to web-based tools, researchers need well-supported frameworks to build upon. Currently, many cancer research image viewers require software to be installed on each user's local workstation, a drawback which limits accessibility and ease of collaboration. Most web-viewers available today are either proprietary, closed systems, or open-source research applications that use legacy technologies. For cancer imaging research that requires multi-site collaboration, there is a growing need for a framework that can enable researchers to review images and collaborate with colleagues remotely. OHIF’s zero-footprint web- viewer tools provide enormous usability benefits for end users, who gain instant access to view data across computers without any software to install or update. Under a prior NCI ITCR U24 grant, we developed the OHIF Framework, which provides a professional- grade, free, open-source web-based imaging environment for cancer research with image review, annotation functionality, and a user-friendly interface. The OHIF Viewer relies on standards, which has enabled easy integration with other systems, and it can be extended to provide custom functionality without modifying the core application. Additionally, its components can be re-used to rapidly develop new applications and help enable the transition to cloud computing for cancer research tools. The core goal of this proposal is to enhance and sustain the OHIF platform and broaden the user and contributor base of this technology. The current project has three aims: 1) extend the web-viewer’s cancer imaging visualization and analysis capabilities; 2) reduce barriers to adoption by creating ready-to-use installers for on-premises and cloud-hosted deployment; and 3) expand our support infrastructure for the cancer research community. For community support, we will enhance our outreach, engagement, and support initiatives to foster collaboration with developers and end users. In order to facilitate clinical translation and share our experience with regulatory compliance, we will implement a quality management system (QMS) for core OHIF framework development and regularly release design documentation to the community. Enhancing the platform's functionality, easing installation, and enriching support will allow researchers to better collaborate to evaluate the nature of cancer disease progression and response to treatment. With the widespread adoption of the OHIF platform to date, the impact of these improvements will be far reaching.",2023-05-01T12:05:00Z,2028-04-30T12:04:00Z,RFA-CA-22-024,nofo_RFA-CA-22-024,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,BOSTON,MA,UNITED STATES,itcr

To coordinate the activities of the new Ped-In Vivo-TP initiative, we have assembled a team of investigators from The Jackson Laboratory (JAX) and Seven Bridges Genomics (SB) with unique combined expertise and experience with in vivo cancer models, scalable cloud-based data management and analysis systems, informatics resource development, and multi-site project coordination. Combining the complementary strengths of JAX and SB provides the ideal foundation for a coordinating center to maximize the short- and long-term impacts of the Pediatric In Vivo Testing Program for advancing the application of precision medicine in pediatric oncology. We will manage a comprehensive and cohesive testing program to advance precision medicine in pediatric oncology through effective public-private partnerships among pharmaceutical companies, regulatory agencies, funders, and research organizations. We will achieve this goal through the following aims: Aim 1: Establish and maintain the Pediatric In Vivo Testing Coordinating Center (PIVOT CC) to provide administrative and logistical support for diverse stakeholders in the Pediatric in Vivo Testing Program consortium. We will draw on our team's combined decades of experience with multi-site program management, cancer model development, standardized testing of in vivo cancer models, data management and analysis, and informatics resource development to ensure timely decision making, conformance to standard protocols, resource tracking, and effective communications within the Ped-In Vivo-TP. Aim 2: Provide data management, statistical, and bioinformatics support to ensure data security and integrity. We will leverage existing protocols and software systems at JAX and SB to identify relevant in vivo cancer models and to collect, analyze, and securely manage data generated from testing centers within the consortium. We will perform statistical and bioinformatic analyses on consortium data to reliably inform the evaluation of the efficacy of novel therapeutic agents in a pediatric oncology setting. We will develop a public- facing data portal for sharing of data and methods with the broader scientific community. Aim 3: Provide scientific coordination to maintain an efficient and effective preclinical testing pipeline. We will draw from the extensive experience of our team with in vivo pharmacology and coordination of similar consortia to manage and coordinate the testing of agents by the Ped-In Vivo-TP centers at all stages of the process, from the identification of relevant in vivo models to the generation of final technical reports and publication of results.

U24CA264006,A Genome Data Analysis Center Focused on Batch Effect Analysis and Data Integration,"* * * * PROJECT SUMMARY * * * * Abstract: Technical batch effects pose a fundamental challenge to quality control and reproducibility of even single-laboratory research projects, but the possibilities for serious error are greatly magnified in complex, multi- institutional enterprises such as the cancer molecular profiling projects being undertaken by the NCI Center for Cancer Genomics (CCG). To aid in detection, quantitation, interpretation, and (when appropriate) correction for technical batch effects in such data, we have developed the MBatch software system. MBatch proved indispensable for quality-control “surveillance” of data in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and ongoing CCG projects. But detecting and quantitating batch effects (or trend effects or statistical outliers) are just the first steps in a process. The next steps involve detective work in collaboration with those who generated the data, drawing upon expertise in integrative analysis across data types, pathways, and systems-level biology. That detective work usually succeeds in diagnosing the cause of a batch effect as technical or biological. If technical, then computational methods to ameliorate the batch effect can be applied (judiciously). The primary aim of the proposed Genome Data Analysis Center (GDAC) is to continue to translate that successful quality-control model to the CCG’s other current and future large-scale molecular profiling projects We will be ready to do that on Day 1. We will continue to enhance and extend the power of MBatch and incorporate a number of innovative new algorithms, tools, and interactive visualizations into it (OmicPioneer-sc, MutBatch, CarDEC, and CorNet). Evaluating and correcting batch effects is a complex process, so we will collaborate with other GDACs and data generating centers to determine the influence of artifacts on any analysis results they produce. The second aim is to contribute and enhance additional competencies. We are prepared to (i) provide integrated cluster solutions to segregate cases into biologically relevant groups; (ii) provide tools and expertise for high-level visualization of omic data (including single-cell data); and (iii) analyze RPPA proteomic data from the subset of projects that generate such data. Our final aim is to communicate results and distribute corrected data back to other network members, project stakeholders, and the scientific community. We bring a number of assets to the table, including multidisciplinary expertise in bioinformatics, biostatistics, software engineering, cancer biology and cancer medicine; PIs with a combined 40+ years of experience in molecular profiling of cancers; expertise gained in 10 years of doing the batch effects surveillance for TCGA and other CCG projects; a highly professional software engineering team with a track record of producing high-end bioinformatics tools; extensive computing resources, including one of the most powerful academic clusters in the world; and close working relationships with first-class basic, translational, and clinical researchers across MD Anderson, one of the foremost cancer centers in the U.S. The bottom-line mission of the GDAC will be to aid the research community’s effort to understand cancer and to prevent, detect, diagnose, and treat it more effectively.",2021-09-22T12:09:00Z,2026-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-20-053,nofo_RFA-CA-20-053,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,HOUSTON,TX,UNITED STATES,gdan
U24CA264007,OHSU Center for Specialized Data Analysis as part of the GDAN,"Project Summary Recent advances in therapeutics have improved survival rates for many cancers. However, nearly all metastatic tumors are incurable, and resistance to therapeutic interventions is nearly universal. There are many reasons for our lack of progress-foremost of which is lack of understanding of mechanisms of response and resistance and lack of markers to identify subsets of patients ideally-suited for specific treatments. Our team brings enormous experience in TCGA and other multi-disciplinary coordinated projects, such as BEAT-AML, and the Stand Up to Cancer West Coast Prostate Cancer Dream Team. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) was successful because multi-disciplinary teams worked together to create new and innovative knowledge about cancer and we intend to ensure that the GDAN is equally successful. In this application, we have assembled a team of proven investigators from four of the different TCGA groups to extend the successes of TCGA to the projects managed by the Center for Cancer Genomics. Our team will continue our outstanding capabilities at analyzing and interpreting cancer genomic data by deploying data analysis pipelines that support the key capabilities of the network. In addition to the our experience in coordinated network studies, we bring experience with clinical trial design and interpretation. Further, the team has deep expertise at building the computational infrastructure necessary for the GDAN to succeed. For example, in the domain of distributed computing we have deploy pipelines for execution at many sites. We also bring novel methods for integrative pathways and analysis. Finally, we bring our experiences with competitive challenges that ensure that we can identify and deploy the most effective methods for genomic data analyses. Using these strengths we will support the GDAN and the Analysis Working Groups (AWGs) that it serves with two principal objectives. The first objective and second objective, per the RFA, are the “Development of innovative bioinformatics and computational tools and methodologies”, which will allow us to make clinical and biological correlations and to “Conduct Integrative analysis of data sets generated by GCCs using the bioinformatics tools developed by each GDAC.” We will achieve these objectives in five specific aims, one administrative aim to support the GDAN and four aims, one for each of the areas where we propose a competency.",2021-09-01T12:09:00Z,2026-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-20-053,nofo_RFA-CA-20-053,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,PORTLAND,OR,UNITED STATES,gdan
U24CA264009,UCSC-Buck Genome Data Analysis Center for the Genomic Data Analysis Network v2.0,"ABSTRACT Tumor heterogeneity -- the complex mix of tumor subclones, the cell-of-origin that first became transformed, the evolution of tumor subclones under selective pressures of the body and due to treatment, and the interplay of these cells with the tumor microenvironment (TME) -- contributes to the character, behavior, and mystery of tumors and is a key determinant of cancer progression and a patient’s response to therapy. Large-scale genomics projects like the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Genome Data Analysis Network (GDAN) have revealed important characteristics and patterns from a multi-omics overview of various tumor types. However, it remains a mystery on how to maximize the use of these data to choose the best course of treatment for an individual patient. The proposed GDAN will close this gap in knowledge by collecting clinical information and outcomes endpoints alongside the multiple omics platforms that will provide key linkages upon which to train supervised computational approaches. We propose to contribute our key competencies of pathway analysis, integrative machine-learning, mRNA-seq analysis, assessment of driving somatic mutations, and visualization of high-throughput datasets to serve the future GDAN analysis working groups (AWGs) to achieve these goals. We will collect and share widely a database of gene expression signatures that capture cell state information gleaned from the large collection of single-cell mRNA sequencing data such as from the Human Cell Atlas (Aim 1). In addition, we will contribute our existing, and novel extensions to, machine-learning approaches like AKIMATE to maximally use these signatures and others in combination with AWG-approved omics datasets as features to train accurate predictors of response for the GDAN’s studies like ALCHEMIST (Aim 2). Our proposal will adapt the TumorMap to benefit weekly analysis and bolster the exploration and publication of results. Specifically, we will work with the group to create new maps that show the TME and TIC comparisons of the patient samples separately to help elucidate new important subtypes implied by the collected data (Aim 3). As we have done for the past twelve years for TCGA and the GDAN, we propose to continue working closely with the consortium in these endeavors to significantly enrich our understanding of the molecular and cellular basis of tumor heterogeneity and its influence on cancer progression and treatment response.",2021-09-07T12:09:00Z,2026-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-20-053,nofo_RFA-CA-20-053,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA CRUZ,SANTA CRUZ,CA,UNITED STATES,gdan
U24CA264010,"Deep exploration of drivers, evolution, and microenvironment toward discovering principal themes in cancer","Summary/Abstract Tremendous progress on cancer has been made at the molecular level over the past decade, largely due to the broad application of high throughput, large-scale bulk whole genome, exome and RNA sequencing. In particular, the discovery of numerous medium to high-penetrance drivers, characterization of pathogenic germline variants, and the revelation of many-to-many relationships of genes and pathways, have brought a fuller view of the combinatorial complexity of cancer. Indeed, newer technologies, like single-cell and spatial genomics methods, are now augmenting bulk sequence data to power deeper studies of cancer dynamics, such as heterogeneity, evolution, and interaction with the microenvironment. The current view is that such advanced data, augmented by improved bioinformatics analysis tools and larger, well-curated cohorts will enable medicine to push beyond statistical descriptions toward a genuine deterministic understanding of cancer. Toward this goal, our proposal seeks to extend and apply established bioinformatics systems to integrate the above technologies and leverage our broad range of capabilities and to support the NCI Genomic Characterization Network (NCI-GCN) and Center for Cancer Genomics (CCG) via three specific aims: (1) annotating and interpreting coding and non-coding somatic and germline alterations, (2) characterizing tumor cell populations, evolution, and the tumor microenvironment, and (3) unlocking biological and clinical insights at both the individual and cross-cancer (Pan-Cancer) levels to discern basic themes across the major human cancers. Our approach involves fluencies in four areas of core competence outlined in the program RFA: DNA mutations, long-read sequence analysis, scRNA-Seq analysis, and spatial genomics data analysis (with connection to digital imaging analysis).",2021-09-01T12:09:00Z,2026-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-20-053,nofo_RFA-CA-20-053,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,SAINT LOUIS,MO,UNITED STATES,gdan
U24CA264021,Specialized RNA analysis center for integrative genomic analyses,"ABSTRACT Projects like The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) have generated a tremendous amount of data characterizing the genomic events in cancer and highlighting the deep complexity and significant heterogeneity that can make precision medicine challenging. Molecular subtyping has helped to identify groups of samples with shared genomic characteristics that can be used for clinical decisions. RNA expression has played a strong role in molecular subtyping over the last twenty years. Integration of RNA expression data with other data types that are being generated as part of the Genome Data Analysis Network have improved our knowledge of tumorigenesis and separating driving events from passenger events. Our team has over a 20 year history of innovation in expression technologies, innovating across generations of assays and projects. We propose to apply our knowledge, experience, and methods to address the projects that will be addressed in this cooperative agreement including clinical trial samples from ALCHEMIST or the Clinical Trials Sequencing Program. We propose to address four specific areas of research including `expression/mRNA analysis', `Spatial genomics data analysis', `data integration', and “clinical outcomes.” We will provide 1) analysis of RNA sequencing and expression data, 2) normalization and analysis methods of spatial transcriptomics data, 3) integrative genomic approaches for cancer classification and characterization, and 4) analysis of biomarkers for association with clinical and other molecular features. We will provide our data to other GDACs and work collaboratively with them to integrate our analyses and generate data for sharing with the larger scientific community through the Genome Data Commons.",2021-09-01T12:09:00Z,2026-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-20-053,nofo_RFA-CA-20-053,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,CHAPEL HILL,NC,UNITED STATES,gdan
U24CA264023,Integrative Cancer Epigenomic Data Analysis Center (ICE-DAC),"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The widespread nature of epigenetic abnormalities in human cancers has become increasingly appreciated in the past decade, with clinical impacts in cancer detection, cancer classification, chemoresistance prediction, and therapy. Large-scale cancer genomic screens have revealed a previously unrecognized prevalence of somatic mutations among epigenetic regulators in human cancers, including chromatin remodelers, as well as histone or DNA methylation readers, writers, and erasers. Epigenetic alterations can serve as driver events in cancer by inactivating tumor-suppressor genes. The finding that these silencing events are mutually exclusive with structural or mutational inactivation of the same gene reinforces the functional significance of epigenetic silencing. The majority of cases of microsatellite instability in sporadic human tumors can be attributed to epigenetic silencing of the MLH1 mismatch repair gene. Clearly, epigenetic mechanisms play a key role in human cancer, and a comprehensive molecular characterization of cancer should include epigenomic profiling. In 2015 we established an Integrative Cancer Epigenomic Data Analysis Center (ICE-DAC) to provide specialized expertise in epigenomic data analysis as part of the Genome Data Analysis Network (GDAN). We have made major contributions to the GDAN in the past five years, developing cutting-edge DNA methylation bioinformatics tools, leading analysis teams in PanCanAtlas, ATAC-Seq, Pan-Gastrointestinal (Pan-GI) Cancers and Tumor Molecular Pathology (TMP), and making major contributions to the Exceptional Responders (ER) study, testicular germcell tumors (TGCT), data harmonization (QC), CCG Ancestry Informative Markers (AIM), and many other projects. Here we propose to sustain this productive activity in a continuation of the ICE-DAC, lending our deep expertise in epigenomic data analysis to collaborative, integrative genomic and epigenomic analyses of clinical specimens within the NCI GDAN. In Specific Aim 1, we will provide advanced specialized analysis of bulk and single-cell cancer epigenomic data generated by programs within the NCI Center for Cancer Genomics. We have developed various tools for epigenetic analysis and implemented an automated workflow to provide timely primary data analysis for AWGs. In Specific Aim 2 we will implement innovative tools to extract additional information from specialized data types. This Aim maximizes the utility of the data generated, and adds to the rigor of analysis by providing orthogonal validation. These analyses will include prediction of common covariates (such as sex, age and race) for the samples, analysis of tumor purity and composition, inferences of genetic information (including genetic mutation, copy number and large structural variants), all from the DNA methylation assays. In Specific Aim 3 we will integrate epigenomic data with other genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and clinical data to derive biologically and clinically relevant novel insights. Our deep expertise in specialized epigenomics will address a core competency required in GDAN, and complement other genomic analyses of clinical trial samples.",2021-09-01T12:09:00Z,2026-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-20-053,nofo_RFA-CA-20-053,VAN ANDEL RESEARCH INSTITUTE,GRAND RAPIDS,MI,UNITED STATES,gdan
U24CA264024,Comprehensive analysis of point mutations in cancer,"PROJECT SUMMARY Precision medicine in cancer, a disease of the genome, relies on a deep and comprehensive understanding of the genetic mutations and abnormalities that accumulate in normal cells and drive transformation to cancer. The Getz and Rheinbay Labs have expertise in the discovery and characterization of point mutations through rigorous cancer genome analysis. In this proposal, we aim to create a Genome Data Analysis Center (GDAC) focused on employing our existing tools to robustly and comprehensively characterize point mutations (single-nucleotide variations and small indels) across the entire cancer genome to address scientific questions related to biological underpinnings of cancer that arise in each project we are assigned. We also have the flexibility to adapt our tools as deemed necessary by the unique needs of each project. Specifically, we plan to integrate and characterize mutations, mutational signatures, and other data types to comprehensively discover cancer drivers in coding and non-coding regions of the genome, including the often ignored more difficult-to-analyze regions of the genome. We will do this by incorporating methods to determine DNA methylation signatures as well as by interrogating the epigenome in both coding and non-coding regions of the genome. We further plan to advance our ability to determine trajectories of tumor evolution and heterogeneity by adapting our PhylogicNDT suite of tools to analyze the evolution, subclonal heterogeneity, and timing and order of mutational events from multiple samples (e.g., samples acquired longitudinally or spatially) from the same patient, or even from cell-free DNA (cfDNA) from non-invasive blood biopsy. In the interest of advancing the GDC’s goal of improving personalized medicine, we teamed with expert clinicians and translational scientists, Dr. Keith Flaherty and Dr. Kirsten Kübler, that will interpret our findings, associate them with clinical data and direct them towards clinical impact. They will also enhance our tools for identifying the tissue- and cell-of-origin of cancers to not only better understand the underlying mechanisms of transformation in a particular cancer type or subtype but also provide more effective therapeutic targets. Moreover, our final Aim is to perform patient-specific analysis to improve and enable precision medicine, especially in patients whose tumors do not have any identified actionable driver events. Here, we will employ machine learning techniques to build predictive models of therapeutic vulnerabilities. Overall, we offer primary competencies in DNA point mutation characterization, analysis of cfDNA, and determination of mutational signatures to the GDAN. We also bring added value with secondary competencies in methylation analysis (in the context of mutational signatures), mRNA analysis, single-cell RNA sequencing, and pathway/integrative data analysis. Bringing our extensive expertise to the various newly assembled Analysis Working Groups and collaborating with other GDACs within the GDAN can help to answer outstanding questions in cancer with the ultimate goal of improving diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment for every cancer patient.",2021-09-20T12:09:00Z,2026-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-20-053,nofo_RFA-CA-20-053,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",CAMBRIDGE,MA,UNITED STATES,gdan
U24CA264027,"Pathway, Network and Spatiotemporal Integration of Cancer Genomics Data","PROJECT SUMMARY Cancer sequencing projects have demonstrated that tumors are tremendously heterogeneous, reflecting the large diversity of perturbations in the cellular machinery that promote tumor growth and metastasis. Tumors from different patients with the same type of cancer have a diverse collection of genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic aberrations. Moreover, a tumor from a single patient is a mixture of cell types including normal cells, stroma, and multiple subpopulations of cancerous cells. We propose a Genome Data Analysis Center (GDAC) that will develop and apply novel computational approaches to address the challenges of inter-tumor and intra-tumor heterogeneity. This GDAC will integrate data from multiple genome characterization platforms, multiple sequencing technologies -- including bulk, single-cell, and spatial sequencing technologies – and leverage prior knowledge of pathways and interaction networks to explain clinical phenotypes and inform treatment strategies. The GDAC will perform pathway and network integration of genome characterization data, spatial analysis of tumor microenvironment, and temporal analysis of intra-tumor heterogeneity, tumor evolution, and network rewiring. These analyses will enable more precise translation of cancer genome characterization efforts into clinical utility for a larger fraction of cancer patients. The GDAC will continue the ongoing contributions of the PIs to the current Genome Data Analysis Network (GDAN) and previous efforts in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) projects.",2021-09-22T12:09:00Z,2026-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-20-053,nofo_RFA-CA-20-053,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,Princeton,NJ,UNITED STATES,gdan
U24CA264028,The MSK Genomic Data Analysis Center for Tumor Evolution,"Abstract The MSK Genomic Data Analysis Center for Tumor Evolution seeks to implement tools, best practices and analytical workflows for studying cancer evolution from cancer genome and transcriptome sequencing data. Over the last 15 years, survey sequencing of patient populations of many cancer types has elucidated novel driver mutations which are mechanistically responsible for disease pathogenesis. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and individual laboratory efforts have broadened the understanding of biological processes impacted by somatic mutation and revealed new therapeutic targets that have achieved clinical impact. However, most of this work has been based on bulk DNA sequencing from primary tumors and single biopsies from patients. It is well understood that cancer is an evolutionary process during which clonal expansions within patients generates heterogeneity and phenotypic diversity of cell populations across metastatic sites over time (with or without therapeutic intervention). Indeed, the same targeted therapies developed based on mutation discoveries often select for resistant clones, keeping durable cures out of reach. We will develop analytical methods, tools and software infrastructure to study cancer progression through the lens of evolution, shifting emphasis from analysis of primary tumors to dynamic analyses over clinical trajectories. We expect our program will advance the ability to study clinical trajectories of patients in a more comprehensive approach, including temporal, spatial and single cell analysis to better represent the full clonal repertoires of tumors and to study the determinants of how and why tumors evolve. We use tools, well established in our laboratories, in three key areas: i) variant interpretation from metastatic and post-treatment samples for discovery of therapeutic resistance mutations (Aim 1); ii) multi- sample analysis across anatomic space, and/or time series data from serial biopsy or cell free DNA to track and model clonal dynamics (Aim 2); iii) single cell approaches for clonal decomposition and clone-specific phenotyping within patients (Aim 3). Our team is well positioned to carry out our objectives having developed leading software infrastructures supporting TCGA and clinical sequencing through MSK-IMPACT, development of clinically approved assays for longitudinal monitoring of patients through cell free DNA sequencing (MSK- ACCESS) and through study of clonal evolution at bulk and single cell resolution. We will implement and improve tools to support each of these aims, including Cancer Hotspots, OncoKB, and cBioPortal for Aim 1, PyClone and fitClone for Aim 2 and CloneAlign and CellAssign for Aim 3, tailoring and customizing software to support investigations into the dynamic and evolutionary nature of human cancers. These tools comprise a software infrastructure focused on cancer evolution through variant allele interpretation, multi-sample analysis and single cell investigation. Our infrastructure will enable researchers to automate evolutionary interpretation of disease dynamics to better understand the clinical end points of metastatic progression and therapeutic resistance.",2021-09-01T12:09:00Z,2026-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-20-053,nofo_RFA-CA-20-053,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,NEW YORK,NY,UNITED STATES,gdan
U24CA264029,"Center for the Comprehensive Analysis of Cancer Somatic Copy-Number Alterations, Rearrangements, and Long-Read Sequencing Data","Abstract We propose to continue our established Genomics Data Analysis Center for the analysis of structural variants in cancer, including somatic copy-number alterations (SCNAs) and rearrangements, addressing the Copy Number competency required by GDAN. We also add capabilities to analyze long- and linked-read data, addressing a second competency. We led SCNA analyses throughout The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the first iteration of the Genomics Data Analysis Network (GDAN). We also co-led the Structural Variations Working Group of the International Cancer Genome Consortium Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG). For these efforts, we have developed a large suite of tools and deep expertise covering all aspects of analysis of SVs in cancer. Specifically, we will accomplish five Aims: In Aims 1 and 2, we will determine SCNA and rearrangement profiles from either short-read (whole exome or whole genome) or long-/linked-read sequencing data, and determine germline genotypes, parental haplotypes, and ancestry groups. The haplotype information will be used to improve our copy-number resolution. In Aim 3, we reconstruct the tumor genome and its evolutionary history. We evaluate sample heterogeneity including tumor purity, ploidy, and subclonal alterations, and phase rearrangements to homologous chromosomes—determining somatic distances between all pairs of loci. Using these data, we determine mechanisms of DNA damage and repair and infer the events that occurred over tumor evolution. In Aim 4, we integrate data across samples to identify SVs and genomic loci that impact tumor evolution, detect associations with other molecular and clinical features, and evaluate potential SCNA-determined subclasses. Moreover, we perform association and admixture analyses with the germline genotypes detected in Aim 1. In Aim 5, we indicate ways in which we will immerse ourselves within the GDAN and disseminate our analysis results both within the GDAN and to the wider community. Within this, we offer secondary competencies in single-cell and circulating DNA analysis. Our GDAC will provide a comprehensive analysis of the roles of structural variations in cancer development and progression through treatment among GDAN samples. We will also optimize interactions with the wider GDAN and scientific community to make maximal use of these data.",2021-09-20T12:09:00Z,2026-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-20-053,nofo_RFA-CA-20-053,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",CAMBRIDGE,MA,UNITED STATES,gdan

As specified in the RFA, we have chosen to focus on two Core Competencies: (1) DNA Mutations (in coding and non-coding regions, somatic and/or germline) and (2) Copy Number / Purity Analysis ,with a focus on complex structural variants.Our team has developed novel algorithms and pipelines for the analysis of DNA mutations in coding and non-coding regions, characterization of complex structural variants, tumor evolution and linked-read sequencing. We have developed three Specific Aims. In Aim 1, we will perform systematic clinical and functional annotation of coding and non- coding mutations. This includes (1) clinical annotation of coding variants, (2) prioritization and functional annotation of non-coding variants (3) integration of transcriptomic analyses, such as cell type deconvolution of impure tumor samples to provide stromal context to somatic variants (4) correlation of variants with clinical phenotypes, including response to therapy. In Aim 2, we will analyze clinically relevant signatures of genome-wide somatic alteration patterns. We will utilize our state-of-the-art analytic tools for complex structural variant characterization and mutational topography to link (1) mutational processes and (2) cell-of-origin footprints to cancer outcome and drug response.

U24CA264044,A Quantitative PET/CT Research Resource for Co-Clinical Imaging of Lung Cancer Therapies,"Project Abstract The specific goal of this proposal is to develop and optimize methods for quantitative pre-clinical PET imaging for immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapies in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We will leverage an existing co-clinical trial using our genetically-engineered mouse model (GEMM) of lung adenocarcinoma to develop, test and implement the methods and populate a web-accessible research resource. This web- accessible research resource will in turn leverage recent developments in quantitative cancer imaging informatics using the industry-standard DICOM format. In response to PAR-18-841 there are four components to our proposal: (1) appropriate models, (2) a co-clinical trial including a therapeutic goal, (3) quantitative preclinical and clinical PET imaging, and (4) an innovative quantitative cancer imaging informatics platform. Our longer term goal is to improve outcomes for NSCLC patients, as lung cancer is still the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. Although ICI therapy has been a tremendous clinical benefit for some NSCLC patients, only ~20% of NSCLC patients respond to anti-PD1/PDL1 therapy. Using PET co-clinical imaging to improve ICI therapies for NSCLC is challenged by a lack of suitable informatics methods to capture and track necessary meta-information, appropriate response criteria for preclinical imaging, which in turn is a consequence in part of the lack of quantitative preclinical PET imaging methods that are linked to quantitative clinical PET imaging methods. We will address these challenges with three Specific Aims: 1, Develop and optimize quantitative preclinical quantitative imaging methods and protocols. These methods will involve novel long-lived phantoms that can cross-calibrate multiple preclinical and clinical PET scanners. This will be tested with partner members of the Co-Clinical Imaging Research Resources Program. 2. Implement the optimized methods in our co-clinical trial of ICI treatment of NSCLC with a GEMM lung adenocarcinoma model and a GEMM model lung squamous cell carcinoma. From this we will evaluate how the information gleaned from the pre-clinical and clinical studies can be used to inform future pre-clinical studies in terms of optimized mouse imaging protocols and response criteria. 3. Share data and resources on co-clinical trials using quantitative PET imaging using a web-accessible open science approach (open source + open data) by extending the DICOM standard for pre-clinical small animal imaging with DICOM-compliant structures that provide necessary quantitative meta-data. These methods and resources developed during this project will be distributed to accelerate the development of needed effective cancer therapies by improving the utility of early-phase oncology trials using co-clinical studies with PET imaging. In addition, we will determine, and potentially improve, the utility of PET imaging as a biomarker for early assessment of response in co-clinical immunotherapy studies by using an appropriate mouse model.",2021-09-15T12:09:00Z,2026-08-31T12:08:00Z,PAR-18-841,nofo_PAR-18-841,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,SEATTLE,WA,UNITED STATES,cirp
U24CA264128,The Cancer Proteome Atlas: an Integrated Bioinformatics Resource for Functional Cancer Proteomic Data,"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Reverse-phase protein arrays (RPPAs) offer a powerful functional proteomic approach to investigate molecular mechanisms and response to therapy in cancer. MD Anderson Cancer Center is a leader in the implementation of this antibody-based technology that can assess many protein markers across large numbers of samples in a cost-effective, sensitive, and high-throughput manner. The platform currently assesses ~500 protein markers, covering all major signaling pathways and most drug targets. Its utility was demonstrated through its selection as the platform for proteomic characterization of ~8,000 patient samples through TCGA and >1,000 cell lines through CCLE, and its designation as one of two NCI Genome Characterization Centers in 2015. It is an approved Cancer Therapy Evaluation Platform site for sample characterization, leading to the implementation of multiple effective clinical trials. With ITCR support, we have developed a major bioinformatics resource dedicated to the analysis, visualization, and dissemination of RPPA data, The Cancer Proteome Atlas (TCPA), which has a community of >80,000 users worldwide. The current objective is to improve the data quality control, to enhance the existing analytic capabilities, and to expand the scope of TCPA by adding new functionalities and datasets. We have formed working relationships to link TCPA with other widely used bioinformatics resources. As an experienced, multidisciplinary team, we will pursue four specific aims: Aim #1. Develop a user-friendly, all-in-one software pipeline for processing RPPA data. We will improve quality control and batch effects adjustment steps of RPPA data processing, enhance the performance of the pipeline and interactivity of the results, and provide a user-friendly, general software package to the scientific community. Aim #2. Expand and enhance our existing web platforms for the analysis of RPPA data. We will extend the scope of RPPA data, incorporate other types of molecular data, especially proteomic data, and enhance the analytic and visualization capabilities. Aim #3. Build a user-friendly, interactive web platform for the analysis of cancer RPPA data from xenograft, PDX, and animal models. We will collect and compile RPPA data of >10,000 such samples and develop related visualization and analytic modules. Aim #4. Promote TCPA and active interaction with the user community. We will enhance the RPPA data repository and promote it as a standard reference database, provide documentation, hands-on workshops, and bug fixes, and build web APIs for interaction with other tools. The expected outcome is a dedicated, comprehensive bioinformatics resource that fully integrates RPPA data generation, analysis, dissemination, and user feedback, allowing for fluent exploration and analysis of high-quality proteomic data in rich contexts. The project is important because it will greatly enhance the quality and reproducibility of RPPA data from important consortium projects; substantially reduce barriers in mining complex functional proteomic data; serve as a hub for integrating high-quality RPPA-based proteomics data into other widely used bioinformatic resources, and directly facilitate the development of protein markers for precision cancer medicine.",2022-07-01T12:07:00Z,2027-06-30T12:06:00Z,RFA-CA-21-015,nofo_RFA-CA-21-015,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,HOUSTON,TX,UNITED STATES,itcr
U24CA264250,ARCHS4: Massive Mining of Publicly Available RNA Sequencing Data,"SUMMARY Many cancer-related independent studies that employ bulk and single cell RNA-seq remain under reused due to their lower findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability. The data from these studies can be found in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) but it is provided mostly as raw FASTQ files with non-uniform metadata annotations. While some studies provide aligned reads files, these are processed non-uniformly. This shortcoming makes it difficult to query and integrate this data across studies and with additional external data. To bridge the gap that currently exists between RNA-seq data generation and RNA-seq data processing and reuse, we developed the resource All RNA-seq and ChIP-Seq Sample and Signature Search (ARCHS4). ARCHS4 provides processed RNA-seq data from GEO to support retrospective data analyses and reuse. ARCHS4 caters to users with different levels of computational expertise and has been already employed for many post-hoc analyses and projects. The goals go far beyond just providing cancer researchers with direct access to RNA-seq data through a web-based user interface. We plan to transform other transcriptomics data into RNA-seq-like profiles with Deep Learning, identify pathogenic sequences in human RNA-seq samples, identify short variants from RNA-seq reads, predict gene function from co-expression data including ways to modulate the expression of long non-coding RNAs with small molecules, and most importantly, using the ARCHS4 cost-effective infrastructure, continue to provide a free FASTQ alignment service to the community.",2022-09-01T12:09:00Z,2027-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-21-015,nofo_RFA-CA-21-015,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,NEW YORK,NY,UNITED STATES,itcr
U24CA264298,Co-Clinical Research Resource for Imaging Tumor Associated Macrophages,"Co-Clinical Research Resource for Imaging Tumor Associated Macrophages ABSTRACT The development of quantitative imaging (QI) methods for monitoring cancer therapy response has been transformative for the development of novel cancer therapeutics. QI efforts have positioned imaging as a key element in the design of clinical trials for cancer therapy response assessment. Hence, there is increased interest by the academic and industry sectors to use web accessible research resources and develop consensus approaches to validate QI methods for the next generation of clinical trials. This is particularly relevant for assessment of cancer immunotherapy, since immunotherapy does not lead to a decrease in tumor size, at least not in the immediate post-treatment phase. Therefore, we urgently need new QI tools that can monitor tumor response to novel immunotherapies. The overall goal of our project is to optimize and validate preclinical and clinical imaging techniques for in vivo quantification of tumor associated macrophages (TAM) in osteosarcomas. Recent evidence has shown that the abundant TAM response in the microenvironment of bone sarcomas can be employed to directly attack cancer cells. Blockade of the cell surface molecule CD47 expressed on sarcoma cells resulted in activation of phagocytic anti-cancer activity from TAM and efficiently eradicated tumor cells in mouse models of osteosarcoma. 26 Preclinical studies have been finalized and a multi-center phase I clinical trial is currently being planned, with expected start date in 2021. To solve the unmet clinical need for a QI tool to monitor response to new TAM- modulating therapies, our team developed a quantitative TAM imaging test, which relies on intravenous injection of the iron supplement ferumoxytol. Ferumoxytol is composed of iron oxide nanoparticles, which are phagocytosed by TAM and can be quantified with T2*-weighted MRI 45. Since ferumoxytol is FDA-approved and can be used “off label” as a TAM biomarker, it is immediately clinically available. We showed that ferumoxytol-MRI can detect TAM in osteosarcomas in mouse models 21 and patients 25. Through this project, we will (a) optimize and validate pre-clinical quantitative imaging methods for TAM imaging in an established mouse model of osteosarcoma, (b) implement the optimized methods in a co-clinical trial in patients with osteosarcoma who are undergoing immunotherapy with CD47 mAb, and finally (c) populate a web-accessible research resource with all the data, methods, and results collected from the co-clinical investigations. Developing the proposed imaging test could represent a significant breakthrough for clinicians as a new means for treatment stratification and new gold-standard imaging test for predicting treatment response of novel immunotherapies. Our QI imaging test could be utilized to compare the efficacy of different immune-modulating therapies in preclinical settings and translate the most primising candidates to the clinic.

U24CA264369,M-ISIC: A Multimodal Open-Source International Skin Imaging Collaboration Informatics Platform for Automated Skin Cancer Detection,"ABSTRACT Skin cancer is the most common type of cancer in the United States. It is critical to detect it early as skin cancers, especially melanoma, can be cured by surgery alone if detected early. As digital technology improves, skin cancer detection, and especially automated skin cancer detection, is increasingly being performed over images either in person or remotely via teledermatology. While artificial intelligence (AI) for skin cancer detection exceeds human performance on static images, algorithm performance on representative, multimodal data is still underdeveloped due to data collected piecemeal with different devices, without consistent image acquisition standards or automated registration. A well-curated dataset of annotated skin images helps meet a unique need beyond machine learning, as primary care clinicians also require expertly annotated images for education and training. We will overcome the lack of imaging standards and disparate data sources problematic in dermatology imaging by developing automated ingestion, organization, registration, and curation pipeline to improve AI for skin cancer detection. The International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) Archive includes over 2,500 citations, 156,000 images, 100 daily users, and 5 AI grand challenges with over 3,500 participants. The ISIC archive is built upon the open- source, NCI- supported, open-source web-based data management platform, Girder. The Girder platform is highly flexible, and has been extended to multiple applications (e.g., pathology, radiology). The flexibility of the Girder platform will enable us to address four major barriers that prevent our ability to efficiently ingest, host and serve large amounts of multidimensional data at the scale of non-medical image repositories (e.g. ImageNet): (1) need for laborious expert data curation and quality assurance review for protected health information, imaging artifacts, and incorrect labels (SA1.1); (2) limited metadata without content-based features creating cumbersome image retrieval (SA1.2); (3) lack of multimodal viewing capabilities (SA2); and (4) inadequate integration to existing AI and annotation software, preventing flexible, hypothesis-driven experimentation (SA3). The proposed informatics project aimed at data ingestion, multimodal visualization, and organization through ML and computer vision-based automation build on the initial success of the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) Archive and the Girder platform upon which it is built. They will enable scaling of the Archive to millions of images, enabling multimodal experimentation with registered reflectance confocal microscopy images, and nimbly facilitate AI and translational experimentation for improved skin cancer detection.",2022-09-01T12:09:00Z,2027-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-21-015,nofo_RFA-CA-21-015,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,NEW YORK,NY,UNITED STATES,itcr
U24CA264379,"Software and algorithms for elucidating the structure, function, and evolution of extrachromosomal DNA","Project Summary Somatic copy number amplification (SCNA) of tumor promoting oncogenes, and focal copy number amplifi- cations specifically, are a major driver of cancer pathogenicity. Recent results have revealed that that focal oncogene amplification is mediated to a large extent by extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) i.e., large (1.3 Mb on average), highly amplified, oncogene-containing circular molecules that occur in nearly 25% of cancers across all sub-types, but rarely in normal cells. Unresolved questions regarding the formation, evolution, het- erogeneity, and pathogenicity of ecDNA are becoming central to uncovering vulnerabilities that can be targeted for diagnostics and therapy. The proposed project will enhance and disseminate “Software and algorithms for elucidating the structure, function, and evolution of extrachromosomal DNA.” Specifically, we will (1) de- velop CAPER (a Community Accessible Pipeline for EcDNA Reconstruction) by leveraging the GenePattern ecosystem to provide an easy point and click interface to running the CPU, memory and storage heavy soft- ware; (2) design and implement novel algorithmic improvements to the CAPER work flow, including support for long-reads and integration of Omics data; and, (3) enable the broad adoption of CAPER through strategic collaborations, outreach and education.",2021-09-01T12:09:00Z,2026-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-20-009,nofo_RFA-CA-20-009,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",LA JOLLA,CA,UNITED STATES,itcr
U24CA269315,Extending the Capabilities and Reach of EMERSE in Support of Cancer Research,"PROJECT SUMMARY The free text notes in electronic health records (EHRs) contain details vital to cancer research that often are found nowhere else in the EHR. Such details include social and behavioral determinants of health, family histories, cancer staging, tumor markers, disease progression, response to treatment, overall outcomes, and more. Utilizing the free text (also called unstructured data) can be challenging, and researchers need tools to help them leverage those data in a meaningful way. The electronic medical record search engine (EMERSE) has been in operation, and under continuous development, for 17 years and was designed to help cancer researchers meaningfully use unstructured EHR data. EMERSE started as simple information retrieval system but has since gained many features for supporting clinical research. It is distinguished from other text-processing research tools, in part, by its ease of use and other enterprise software features such as maintaining audit logs and providing administrator functions. With the support of an ITCR grant that is nearing completion, EMERSE has grown from a tool used at only one site (University of Michigan) to one that is running, or being implemented, at multiple cancer centers and other academic research institutions across the country. EMERSE also now supports the capability of searching across a network of instances to securely obtain obfuscated patient counts at other sites, which can be valuable for identifying rare cancer cohorts. The innovations in this proposal include: (1) Building new functionality into EMERSE to expand its research capabilities such as timeline data visualizations, self-service data extraction workflows from templated notes, support for optical character recognition (OCR), and integration with other ITCR tools such as DeepPhe through an application programming interface (API); (2) Incorporating natural language processing (NLP) into EMERSE including named entity recognition (mapped to the Unified Medical Language System, UMLS), negation (e.g., “patient denies pain”), uncertainty (e.g., “possibility of recurrence”), and experiencer (e.g, “breast cancer in her mother”); (3) Expanding the EMERSE network in breadth, capability, security, and trust by partnering with external sites to collectively develop a consensus and a viable approach for broadly enabling this novel network technology; and (4) Continuing to evaluate EMERSE with a focus on networking, security, and scientific outcomes by conducting additional user-centered studies to develop a deeper understanding of how EMERSE is being, or could be, used with a goal of continuous improvement. The EMERSE team routinely receives feedback from users and site administrators and the proposed work is highly responsive to our growing user base and will enable research that is currently impractical, if not impossible, for many researchers to accomplish. The enhancements and knowledge gained from this effort will make EMERSE even more powerful and capable of supporting a wide range of clinical and translational cancer research for a growing user base across the nation.",2023-09-15T12:09:00Z,2028-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-22-023,nofo_RFA-CA-22-023,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,ANN ARBOR,MI,UNITED STATES,itcr
U24CA269436,The Network Data Exchange - a Network Commons for Biologists,"THE NETWORK DATA EXCHANGE – A NETWORK COMMONS FOR BIOLOGISTS PROJECT SUMMARY Knowledge of biological networks has been critical to the analysis of big biomedical datasets, including interpretation of the molecular heterogeneity seen within and across tumors. NDEx, the Network Data Exchange (ndexbio.org), is an online commons where scientists find, share, and publicly distribute biological networks. With a previous grant from the Informatics Technology for Cancer Research program (ITCR U24 CA184427), we created the NDEx open-source database platform along with its public website and query system. Further, we enabled interoperability with the Python and R data science platforms and built NDEx seamlessly into the Cytoscape network analysis and visualization ecosystem. NDEx presently serves a large base of users and network content, with approximately 3285 accounts linked to >180,000 networks, of which approximately 6500 are publicly accessible. NDEx is the approved network repository for articles published in the Springer Nature and Public Library of Science (PLoS) families of journals. We are requesting sustained ITCR funding for the NDEx project to maintain, scale, and enhance the NDEx system, meeting the evolving needs of the biomedical research community via the following five Specific Aims: 1. Maintain and scale NDEx and its services to support a large and growing community of users. Regular software releases of NDEx will continue to extend its capabilities. Targeted server hardware upgrades will increase capacity and performance to match the growing use of NDEx. 2. Extend the NDEx corpus of cancer pathway networks. We will continue to maintain and extend the NDEx Cancer Collection (NCC) corpus of networks via outreach, collaborations, and automated text and image analysis methods to capture cancer networks from literature. 3. Enable the use of networks in next-generation cancer genome analysis. We will enhance the use of networks in existing 'omics analysis tools used by the cancer research community and develop and maintain analysis tools that leverage NDEx functionality and data. 4. Enable publishing of interactive networks. Building on our success in enabling publications to link to NDEx networks, we will add new capabilities for authors and readers to enhance the dissemination of interactive networks and their use in publications. 5. Provide support and training, track usage, and gather feedback. The NDEx Project is committed to user engagement and development driven by the needs of cancer researchers and their user feedback. Through these aims, the NDEx project will transition from system-building to sustaining and enabling network biology for the NCI-supported cancer community.",2023-04-15T12:04:00Z,2028-03-31T12:03:00Z,RFA-CA-22-024,nofo_RFA-CA-22-024,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",LA JOLLA,CA,UNITED STATES,itcr
U24CA270823,Center of Excellence for High Throughput Proteogenomic Characterization,"Project Summary Cancer proteogenomics encompasses methods that integrate mass spectrometry (MS)-based measurements of protein abundance and post-translational modifications (PTMs) with genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic data from preclinical cancer models and tumor samples. The multidisciplinary Proteogenomic Characterization Center we propose will employ a range of state-of-the-art MS-based proteomic and metabolomic technologies to systematically generate and integrate high quality, comprehensive and quantitative proteomic and metabolomic data with genomic data. Our overarching goals are to leverage the integrated data to identify signatures of cancer drivers, detect signaling network adaptations and provide information on PTMs that affect cellular signaling, molecular complex formation, and protein location, translation and stability in human biospecimens and relevant models of cancer. Peptidomes of the class I and II human leukocyte antigens (HLA) of the tumors will also be analyzed to shed light on tumor-immune escape mechanisms and antigen processing in cancer, improve algorithms for prediction of antigen display and immunogenicity and inform development of personalized cancer vaccines. We hypothesize that integrating deep, high quality, quantitative proteomic and, especially, PTM-omic, HLA-peptidomic and metabolomic data with genomic and transcriptomic data will provide novel insights into the pathophysiology of cancer and help to identify new, actionable targets for drug development and treatment. Data will be rapidly distributed to the cancer biology and clinical communities, as we have done for the past 15 years in the NCI-CPTAC program. The resulting datasets will enable a broad range of investigation by many teams, accelerating molecularly-oriented cancer research toward biological and clinical impact. We will also systematically develop and apply high sensitivity targeted MS assays to peptide/protein targets identified in the Discovery Arm, with an emphasis on posttranslationally-modified peptides in signaling cascades, oncogenic pathway regulators and effectors, and druggable proteins. Assays will use stable isotope- labeled standards for unambiguous identification and quantification and follow Tier 2 guidelines developed from the community-based effort led by the Broad proteomics team. Existing technologies will be further developed and automated to enable comprehensive analysis of rare tumor cell populations, to evaluate tumor heterogeneity, to increase depth and breadth of post-translational modification analysis, and to improve depth, reliability and repeatability of peptide identification and quantification in general by intelligent data acquisition.",2022-06-15T12:06:00Z,2027-05-31T12:05:00Z,RFA-CA-21-023,nofo_RFA-CA-21-023,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",CAMBRIDGE,MA,UNITED STATES,cptac
U24CA271012,Center for Advanced Multi-Omic Characterization of Cancer,"PROJECT SUMMARY The overall objective of the PNNL Proteome Characterization Center (PCC) is to comprehensively characterize human tumor samples provided by the National Cancer Institute (NCI), and to integrate the multi-omic measurements to support improved understanding of the molecular changes that characterize cancer, and do so in the context of clinical outcome. PNNL has participated in the NCI’s Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) as a PCC for the past ten years, with responsibility for comprehensive proteogenomic characterization of high-grade serous ovarian, colon, and endometrial cancers, and glioblastoma. The planned PNNL PCC will build on those achievements to extend and advance the CPTAC mission of comprehensive proteogenomic characterization of human cancers to additional cancer types, meeting or exceeding CPTAC key expectations or requirements for sample throughput, coverage, sample size, and data quality. Utilizing an advanced analytical platform, PNNL plans to add analysis of both acetylome and ubiquitinome to the phosphoproteome of prospectively collected human tumors, to betters illuminate key biochemical processes related to protein-protein interactions, protein degradation, and signal transduction. We will also complement the core proteome and post-translational modification (PTM)-ome analysis with global metabolome and lipidome analysis, as well as selected data driven spatial or single-cell proteomics analysis. This will provide additional critical insights on potential metabolic vulnerabilities and tumor heterogeneity as well as microenvironment contributions. This multi-omic analysis strategy will also be applied to preclinical samples, such as cell lines, organoids and patient-derived xenografts. We will also develop targeted mass spectrometric assays using input from the CPTAC consortium, and particularly the Proteogenomic Data Analysis Centers (PGDACs), to prioritize targets for further exploring important mechanistic proteomic changes in independent cohort(s). Throughout this work our measurements will benefit from further performance increases (e.g., sensitivity and throughput) based on refining, validating and implementing developments from both PNNL and the other CPTAC Centers. The PNNL PCC will identify promising cancer signatures and signaling networks through proteomic and metabolomic analysis of human biospecimens and relevant preclinical samples for 2-3 cancer types selected by the CPTAC, using state-of-the-art liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry instrumentation, highly multiplexed isobaric mass-tag labeling (TMT 16-plex), and integrated sample workflows, as well as additional advanced metabolomic, spatial and single-cell proteomic planforms, at a throughput of 300 samples per year. We will also explore mechanistically important proteomic changes in human specimens and model systems using cutting-edge targeted proteomic platforms, analytically validated and highly multiplexed targeted assays, and workflows meeting the CPTAC Tier 2 assay guidelines. Two hundred highly specific, multiplexed targeted proteomics assays will be developed and used for measurements in 300 samples each year. The PNNL PCC will accomplish both unbiased and targeted multi-omic characterization of cancers in conjunction with improving the depth, throughput and quality of both unbiased and targeted data generated by implementing and deploying relevant new technologies, such as nanoscale PTM, metabolomic analysis, and single-cell proteomics analysis. The PNNL PCC will work closely with the other PCCs, PGDACs and PTRCs in the CPTAC network on data integration and bioinformatics analysis, as well as translational applications.",2022-06-01T12:06:00Z,2027-05-31T12:05:00Z,RFA-CA-21-023,nofo_RFA-CA-21-023,BATTELLE PACIFIC NORTHWEST LABORATORIES,RICHLAND,WA,UNITED STATES,cptac
U24CA271037,Michigan Center for Translational Cancer Proteogenomics,"ABSTRACT This application aims to establish a Proteogenomic Data Analysis Center at the University of Michigan for the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC). Our Center is anchored at the Michigan Center for Translational Pathology and brings together a multi-disciplinary team of leading scientific experts in the foundational areas of proteomics, cancer genomics, immunomics, and integrative systems biology. Our team established the foundations for precision oncology and proteogenomics at the University of Michigan and has a long history of successful inter-institutional collaborations. This positions us well to apply, working in close collaboration with other CPTAC groups, our innovative algorithms, comprehensive computational infrastructure, and expert knowledge to carry out high-impact translational proteogenomics research that is a core mission of the CPTAC. We have developed a balanced approach for integrative proteogenomic analyses, with a blend of both state-of-art and novel pipelines and tools. Our analytics support dual purpose - to perform both cohort-wide and patient centric (personalized) investigations – a unique future and a strength of our proposal. Our experience in support of our real-time precision oncology program and past CPTAC efforts will ensure both the fidelity of detecting diverse proteogenomic cancer driver events and rigorous ascertainment of their biological implications. Both of these features are of paramount importance to understand disease mechanisms and discover prognostic markers and therapeutic targets. Our proposed strategy combines well-established and innovative data analyses and modeling approaches, cognizant of continuing developments in the corresponding areas. In addition, we propose a conceptually novel approach of “integrative cellular network analysis” and advanced data visualization modules, capitalizing on recent advances in single cell and spatial proteogenomics research. These features will refine inference from the bulk tissue omics data in terms of tumor microenvironment, ploidy and cellularity, identification of cell of origin and clonal expansion, cell-cell interactions, distinguishing lineage versus cancer-specific biomarkers, and gene signatures associated with genetic and epigenetic alterations. Such precise and refined integrative analyses across genome and proteome data require advanced bioinformatics tools and stringent quality control measures. Our integrated genome/transcriptome/proteome pipelines – already in wide use by the research community - will be further optimized for speed and accuracy and enhanced with data visualization and report generation capabilities for presenting the findings to cancer biologists in a transparent and readily- interpreted manner. Furthermore, our extensive experience in the area of biomarker discovery and precision oncology, further enhanced through participation of our investigators in the EDRN, SPORE, and other NIH initiatives, puts us in a strong position to drive the biomarker prioritization work to select candidate cancer- specific proteins and peptides for subsequent targeted validation assays.",2022-06-06T12:06:00Z,2027-05-31T12:05:00Z,RFA-CA-21-024,nofo_RFA-CA-21-024,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,ANN ARBOR,MI,UNITED STATES,cptac

Several publications by the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) and others have highlighted the impact of proteogenomics in enabling deeper insight into the biology of cancer and identification of potential drug targets. Integrative analysis of multi-omic data requires the deployment of complex algorithms and data processing techniques, which are generally inaccessible to scientists without a background in bioinformatics and computational biology. Our proposed center for comprehensive proteogenomic data analysis will encapsulate a comprehensive set of analysis methods in a platform that will be (i) simple to use (ii) flexible (iii) automated, facilitating the routine application to all CPTAC proteogenomic datasets as they become available, and (iv) able to incorporate new methods with minimal effort. We will leverage PANOPLY--a cloud-based platform for automated and reproducible proteogenomic data analysis--as the foundation, with specific, carefully chosen algorithms targeted for addition to provide an expansive set of analysis capabilities that can be easily harnessed to provide a rapid and extensive baseline analysis for proteogenomic studies, leading to many disease specific hypotheses that can be explored further using additional computational and wet-lab experiments. Our collection of tools, algorithms and interactive reports will enable unprecedented, automated and integrative systems-biology level analyses of proteome, post-translational modification and metabolomic data combined with genomic data for individual disease cohorts and pan-cancer analysis across cohorts, leading to deeper understanding of cancer biology and enabling identification of therapeutic targets and disease/prognostic biomarkers.",2022-06-15T12:06:00Z,2027-05-31T12:05:00Z,RFA-CA-21-024,nofo_RFA-CA-21-024,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",CAMBRIDGE,MA,UNITED STATES,cptac
U24CA271076,"iPGDAC, An Integrative Proteogenomic Data Analysis Center for CPTAC","Project Summary By combining mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics with genomics, epigenomics, and transcriptomics, proteogenomics holds great potential to better illuminate cancer complexities than individual ‘omes. During the past 10 years, the Clinical Proteomics Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) has performed comprehensive proteogenomic characterization of >1,500 tumors across 10 cancer types. These studies not only yield novel biological and clinical insights into different cancer types but also produce valuable datasets and computational tools that can be further used by the broad scientific community. The next phase of the CPTAC program seeks to expand the current success to more cancer types and translational research focusing on clinically relevant questions. Our integrative proteogenomic data analysis center (iPGDAC) is one of the current CPTAC funded PGDACs. We have participated in the studies of all CPTAC cancer types and have played a leading role in data analysis for several cancer types. This application seeks to continue and enhance our contribution to the next phase of the CPTAC program. The overarching goal of our PGDAC is to accelerate the translation of cancer proteogenomic data into better understanding of cancer biology and improved cancer treatment. We will continue developing and improving our computing tools, workflows, and web portals that have already been successfully used in the CPTAC studies for sequence-based and pathway/network-based proteogenomic data integration. In addition, we will address unmet needs in post-translational modification (PTM)-related analyses by using protein sequence and natural language-based deep learning techniques to improve PTM peptide identification, to predict genomic variant impact on PTMs, and to connect PTM sites to existing knowledge. Using unique tools from our team and cutting edge statistical inference and machine learning algorithms, we will perform integrated analysis on proteogenomic data from the CPTAC studies to: 1) create a comprehensive molecular and cellular portrait for each patient’s tumor; 2) identify and characterize molecular and tumor microenvironment/immune subtypes; 3) prioritize functional genomic aberrations using proteogenomic data; 4) reveal molecular mechanisms of cancer phenotypes; and 5) develop predictive models for patient prognosis and treatment response. Our PGDAC brings to the CPTAC network a fully integrated, completely established program with expertise in all the critical areas specified by the RFA.

U24CA271079,Proteogenomic Characterization of Tumor Tissues and Preclinical Models with High Precision,"Summary During the last 10 years of both CPTAC2 and CPTAC3, the JHU Proteome Characterization Center (JHU/PCC) has repeatedly demonstrated superior technological innovation and robust data generation that have played critical roles in the success of CPTAC's core mission of accelerating the understanding of the molecular basis of cancer through the application of large-scale proteome and genome analysis technologies to different cancer types. As one of the 3 current CPTAC3 PCCs, we established robust and standardized proteomic analysis protocols and technologies and applied them to 7 human cancer cohorts and an additional 200 patient-derived xenografts from the Patient-Derived Models Repository. Together with the Proteogenomic Data Analysis Centers (PGDACs), we published articles on integrated proteogenomic studies in four cancer types. For our CPTAC4 PCC application, the overarching goal of our PCC is to generate accurate and reproducible data using sensitive, quantitative, and standardized technologies. We will leverage our established Center's infrastructure and capitalize on our success in clinical cancer proteogenomic discoveries to characterize proteins, protein modifications, and protein complexes associated with genomic alterations of cancer from additional human tumor types and pre-clinical models. We will identify unique features that are inherent to proteins such as post-translational modifications covering acetylation and ubiquitination, as well as protein- protein interactions in addition to glycosylation and phosphorylation that have been included in our current PCC. We propose a three-step strategy to characterize defined sets of genomics-characterized samples using technology platforms validated during CPTAC3: (1) Discovery of target proteins from both clinical specimens and preclinical models using quantitative proteomics by tandem mass tags and data dependent acquisition mass spectrometry; (2) Verification of findings using orthogonal data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry; and (3) Confirmation of the verified targets using high-throughput, CPTAC Tier 2 analytically-validated targeted Multiple Reaction Monitoring Mass Spectrometry (MRM-MS) assays. We further propose pilot studies for technology improvement. While this PCC application is focused on the proteomic characterization of clinical specimens and preclinical models, we believe that the understanding of and the expertise in proteogenomic data analysis and translation will be critical for the success of the PCC and the overall CPTAC network. We have assembled a team of outstanding investigators with complementary expertise and years of experience in the CPTAC program (CPTAC2 and CPTAC3), and evidence of successful collaborations with investigators/PIs from the CPTAC PGDACs and Proteogenomic Translational Research Centers (PTRCs).

U24CA271114,Proteogenomic translator for cancer biomarker discovery towards precision medicine,"PROJECT SUMMARY The goal of our PGDAC is to improve our understanding of the proteogenomic complexity of tumors. Towards this goal, our First Aim is to apply multiomics and network based system learning to reveal causative molecular regulatory relationships contributing to varieties of phenotypes in cancer using CPTAC proteogenomic data. We will start with rigorous preprocessing and quality control using a pipeline tailored to MS-based proteomics data to detect and correct batch effects, outliers, sample labeling errors, as well as to impute missing values (Aim 1.1). We will then utilize novel statistical tools to jointly model ≥6 types of omics data to systematically characterize functional impact of DNA alterations (such as DNA mutations, CNA, and methylations) (Aim 1.2). Such cis-/trans-regulatory networks will help us to elucidate how protein or pathway activities are shaped by genomic alterations in tumor cells. We will also construct protein/PTM co-expression networks based on global-, phospho-, glyco- and other PTM-proteomics data (Aim 1.3). When constructing these networks, we will use and create advanced computational tools to effectively borrow information from literature, publicly available open databases, and transcriptome profiles. Moreover, we will study cell type composition from bulk tissue using novel multi-omics deconvolution analyses, and identify immune subtypes with distinct immune activation or evasion mechanisms (Aim 1.4). Furthermore, we will perform comprehensive investigation of kinase and transcription factor activities by leveraging publicly available data extracted and processed from many regulatory network databases (Aim 1.5). All Aims 1.2-1.5 will contribute to a large collection of functionally related protein/PTM sets, co-expression network modules, immune signatures, as well as kinase/TF activity scores. These features and feature-sets will then be tested for their associations with disease phenotypes (Aim 1.6). For all analysis tasks in Aim 1, we will derive an integrated view of commonalities and differences across multiple tumor types via Pan-Cancer analyses. Our Second Aim is to further develop methods, software, and web-based tools to optimize the data analyses of our PGDAC. We will develop novel statistical/computational tools; implement these methods as computationally efficient and user- friendly software; and construct an integrated data analysis pipeline (Aim 2.1). We also plan to develop a set of web-based services for querying, visualizing, and interpreting analysis results from CPTAC studies (Aim 2.2). Our Third Aim is to nominate novel protein-based cancer biomarkers and drug targets for further investigation by targeted proteomics assays. We will first apply machine-learning-based prediction models on features and feature-sets from Aim 1 to identify protein biomarkers that predict disease outcome, treatment responses, and therapeutically distinct disease subtypes (Aim 3.1). We will also query disease related gene, protein, and PTM signatures against function perturbation databases, such as the LINCS L1000 database, to prioritize small molecules and drugs that could be tested for attenuating tumor growth or treatment response (Aim 3.2).",2022-07-01T12:07:00Z,2027-04-30T12:04:00Z,RFA-CA-21-024,nofo_RFA-CA-21-024,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,NEW YORK,NY,UNITED STATES,cptac

Specifically, PRECINCT's CC will provide comprehensive project oversight, supervise all project management and regulatory compliance activities, and coordinate site management for all aspects of trial projects. Through the CC, U01 investigators will have ready access to research services and standard operating procedures (SOPs) for clinical and immunological monitoring and collection of data, reagents and biospecimens that will facilitate the performance of clinical research across the network. Patient accrual will be tracked and where necessary, cross-site accrual will be coordinated within the network to expedite enrollment. The CC will assist in designating supplemental funds to U01 awardees to support intra-network collaborative projects identified by a chosen scientific review panel for funding. We will continue to build infrastructure and expand the network and associate memberships will be encouraged to achieve the critical mass necessary to build working groups to advance PRECINCT's mission and build inter-network collaborations with IOTN, PI-DDN and PACMEN. We will extend PRECINCT's Data Management System to collect, store and share all clinical and correlative data amongst the U01 sites and with the COP directors and Steering Committee, through the development of a cloud-based workspace that will facilitate intra-network collaborative projects and we will perform data quality control and re-formatting required to enable ready upload to the Integrated Canine Data Commons (ICDC). We will build a specimen and reagent registry that will facilitate sharing and tracking of resources and serve to ensure their most efficient use within the network. This together with development of a cloud-based workspace, will foster collaborations between U01 researchers. We will provide biostatistical and bioinformatic support for study design and data analysis to ensure that clinical trials performed within the network are strategically designed and appropriately powered to achieve meaningful clinical and laboratory data results in the most expedite way. Together, the activities and expertise provided by the CC will ensure that reliable and reproducible datasets emerge from these studies which aim to provide essential insight for future translational application to human patients.",2022-09-01T12:09:00Z,2027-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-21-051,nofo_CA21-051,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,PHILADELPHIA,PA,UNITED STATES,precinct
U24CA272450,Metabolic Dysregulation and Cancer Risk Program: Coordinating Center,"PROJECT SUMMARY The goal of the Metabolic Dysregulation and Cancer Risk Consortium (MDCRC) is to identify tangible mechanistic/etiologic pathways that link obesity-related metabolic dysregulation with cancer risk to inform cancer prevention strategies. The Consortium proposes to accomplish this through developing common measures for obesity-related metabolic dysregulation for different cancer types, understanding how obesity- related metabolic dysregulation affects cancer initiation and development, characterizing signal cross-talk between key biologic processes that impact obesity-associated metabolic dysregulation and cancer risk, and determining the utility of emerging approaches for the discovery of novel obesity-associated metabolic targets in cancer risk and prevention. The Biostatistics Center (Center) in the Milken Institute School of Public Health (SPH) of the George Washington University (GW), the participating institution, proposes to serve as the MDCRC Coordinating Center (CC). The MDCRC CC will integrate this expertise and experience, drawing upon our successful history of coordinating center leadership in collaborative research consortia, capacity for innovation, and the extensive scientific expertise in obesity and cancer prevention, nutrition, exercise, metabolism, body composition, and bioinformatics/computational biology to form a CC that is rooted in scientific rigor and is flexible and responsive to the diverse challenges and scientific opportunities of the MDCRC. The specific aims of the MDCRC include to 1) provide scientific leadership and project management for collaborative cross-Consortium activities, including providing guidance on the selection of common measures and development of consistent protocols and manuals of operations, maintain private and public websites, establishing topical work groups, and spearhead outreach activities; 2) facilitate data harmonization, data sharing and results dissemination across the MDCRC sites and with NCI, including identification of opportunities for novel data collection to enrich the MDCRC data resources, developing a common data management platform, and training for site staff; and 3) establish a Self-Evaluation Core to promote timely self- evaluation, along with effective self-correcting actions, working with NCI and the Consortium investigators to establish criteria and outputs related to the “success” of individual investigators, study teams, and Consortium sites.",2022-09-20T12:09:00Z,2027-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-21-022,nofo_CA21-022,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,WASHINGTON,DC,UNITED STATES,metabolic_dysregulation_and_cancer_risk_program
U24CA274159,Coordinating and Data Management Center for Acquired Resistance to Therapy Network,"Project Summary The goal of our proposed Coordinating and Data Management Center (CDMC) application is to coordinate the activities across the Acquired Resistance to Therapy Network (ARTNet), and to manage, integrate and disseminate the data and resources generated through the network. Leveraging cutting-edge multi-disciplinary team approaches, we will support the ARTNet to inform new strategies that can be better translated to overcome significant challenges in acquired resistance to cancer therapies. Our strategy is to enhance the productivity of ARTNet investigators by fostering a collaborative and supportive research community, accelerate the progress of ARTNet research by reducing barriers to accessing analytical expertise, ensure the reproducibility of ARTNet data by deploying best practices for data acquisition and harmonization, and unleash the full potential of ARTNet activities by developing enhanced tools to enable resource sharing to the broader scientific community. First, we will provide a centralized administrative infrastructure to coordinate ARTNet activities, building upon our well-functioning infrastructure that currently coordinates network studies under the umbrella of the NCI Cancer Moonshot initiatives. Second, we will actively promote the ARTNet and engage in trans-consortium interactions, where we will leverage our demonstrable experience in Cross-Moonshot outreach and Bioconductor’s decades-long record in community engagement. Third, we will provide multidisciplinary analytical expertise to support ARTNet collaborative research, leveraging five of Roswell Park CCSG’s shared resources: Biostatistics, Bioinformatics, Biomedical Informatics, Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics, and Data Bank and BioRepository. Our analytical support will be provided at no cost to ARTNet investigators in need of analytical expertise, based on collaboration, transparency, and sharing. Fourth, we will develop improved data integration software and workflows to enhance ARTNet’s research capacity, capitalizing on our extensive track-record in developing NIH-supported Moonshot, Bioconductor and AnVIL ecosystems. The main deliverables from the proposed aims will be administrative and outreach support to coordinate network activities, facilitate network collaboration, and engage in interaction with the broader community (Aim 1); polices and infrastructures to ensure that all resources generated by the ARTNet will be findable in a centralized virtual resource sharing repository, and that all resources will be shared with the broader scientific community (Aim 2); workflows to ensure that all data generated by the ARTNet will be harmonized using standards interoperable with the broader cancer data ecosystem, analysis tools to integrate ARTNet data and facilitate cross-study analysis within and beyond the ARTNet, and multidisciplinary analytical supports to accelerate ARTNet research progress.(Aim 3).",2022-09-01T12:09:00Z,2027-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-21-053,nofo_RFA-CA-21-053,ROSWELL PARK CANCER INSTITUTE CORP,BUFFALO,NY,UNITED STATES,artnet
U24CA274212,Coordinating and Data Management Center  for Translational and Basic Science Research in Early Lesions,"Project Summary Early diagnosis of cancer can improve therapeutic effect and prolong patient survival. The increasingly sensitive and widely adopted early cancer screening technologies have led to significantly more detection of early lesions that may or may not progress to cancer. Elucidating the mechanisms that drive or restrain early cancer would allow differentiation of aggressive cancer versus indolent types, improving personalized treatment and avoiding over-diagnosis and over-treatment. Whether an early lesion progress to cancer or not is not solely decided by the molecular profile of the lesion but also is impacted by the surrounding microenvironment and mediated by other epidemiologic factors. Meanwhile, the progression of an early lesion to malignancy is a complex process that may take years to occur. The complexities of the problem highlight the unmet needs for researchers from basic to translational science to collaborate and coordinate in the research of the underlying mechanisms between early lesion and cancer development. In response to RFA-CA-21-055, we propose a Coordinating and Data Management Center (CDMC) for the Translational and Basic Science Research in Early Lesions (TBEL) Program. The CDMC interacts closely with other entities of the Program, including the Steering Committee, the Research Centers, biospecimen and image repository, pathology centers, sequencing facilities, Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), and NCI, and provides critical scientific, administrative, regulatory, managerial, logistic, and data-analytic support to the TBEL Program. Our proposed CDMC infrastructure and operating procedures have been time-tested in an ongoing NIH-funded Consortium for the Study of Chronic Pancreatitis, Diabetes and Pancreatic Cancer. Specifically, the proposed work includes the three aspects of required responsibilities: consortium coordination (Aim 1), statistical and computational support (Aim 2), and data management, study protocol development and implementation (Aim 3). Our team of experts include information technology specialists who have been supporting and developing innovative software tools for numerous basic and translation cancer studies, experienced research coordinators who have worked on both NIH- and industry-funded multicenter studies, and faculty statisticians and bioinformaticians who have led CDMC work for large NIH consortiums and are well- known experts in biostatistics and bioinformatics methodological research areas closely related to biomarker development, risk prediction, single cell analysis, image analysis, machine learning, and clinical trials.",2022-09-16T12:09:00Z,2027-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-21-055,nofo_CA21-055,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,HOUSTON,TX,UNITED STATES,tbel
U24CA274274,"PASSCODE (Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma Stromal Reprograming ConSortium COordination, Data Management and Education)","ABSTRACT A defining feature of Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the presence of a host stromal response, which is characteristically more robust (“desmoplastic”) than many solid cancers. Stromal elements, including cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and the extracellular matrix, are pivotal components of the tumor microenvironment (TME) ecosystem in PDAC, which also includes immune cells, the lymphovascular system, and the intra-tumoral microbiome. In recent years the role of the PDAC stroma (and CAFs, in particular) has morphed to one characterized by profound heterogeneity, plasticity, and context-specificity. The newly created Pancreatic Cancer Stromal Reprogramming Consortium (PSRC) will fund a team of six U01 sites to conduct basic and translational research studies on the role of the stroma and other TME constituents in PDAC pathogenesis and outcomes. We have collated a multidisciplinary team of investigators at UT MD Anderson with the goal of creating PASSCODE (Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma Stromal Reprograming ConSortium COordination, Data Management and Education Center), that will serve as an organizing “hub” for coordination, communication and collaboration within the PSRC, and support the newly funded U01 sites. PASSCODE will be co-led by Dr. Anirban Maitra, an expert in PDAC pathology, genetics, and cancer biology, and Dr. J. Jack Lee, an expert in biostatistics, clinical trial design and data science. PASSCODE proposes four aims: First, we will support the administrative infrastructure of the PSRC, and ensure effective communication and collaboration between consortium investigators, the NCI program office and other trans-NCI networks, including facilitating all of the PSRC-approved in-person and virtual meetings. We will also provide operational support for material and data transfer agreements that are germane to the collaborative studies within the PSRC. Second, we will develop a framework for a PSRC “virtual biorepository” as a registry database for shared biospecimen access across the consortium, and develop SOPs for processing, storage, cataloging, and distribution of annotated biospecimens and de-identified clinical, demographic, and molecular information. Third, we will provide centralized data management and data storage capabilities for the PSRC, with the overarching goal of data harmonization and dissemination, within and beyond the consortium. As part of this aim, PASSCODE will provide dedicated biostatistical and bioinformatics analytical tools, and multimodal data visualization for PSRC investigators, including for approved collaborative projects. Fourth, PASSCODE will be responsible for developing and maintaining both a “public facing” PSRC website and other social media outlets, as well as a secure intranet site. We will organize seminars and workshops that highlight progress within the PSRC, and provide a platform for educational/mentorship opportunities, especially with regards to enhancing the participation of underrepresented minority trainees. Cumulatively, PASSCODE’s activities will be geared towards ensuring the success of the consortium’s mission of improving PDAC survival through innovative and collaborative research endeavors.",2022-09-16T12:09:00Z,2027-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-21-042,nofo_RFA-CA-21-042,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,HOUSTON,TX,UNITED STATES,psrc
U24CA274494,"Multi-Consortia Coordinating Center (MC2 Center) for Cancer Biology: Building Interdisciplinary Scientific Communities, Coordinating Impactful Resource Sharing, and Advancing Cancer Research","Project Summary Systems Biology has been an instrumental approach to overcoming challenges in biomedical research, where solutions arise from interdisciplinary efforts, shared resources (data, tools, models, expertise) and integrative analyses. The NCI Division of Cancer Biology (DCB) has created multiple consortia comprising interdisciplinary communities of scientists who aim to integrate approaches, data, and tools to address important questions in basic and translational cancer research. The Multi-Consortia Coordinating (MC2) Center for Cancer Biology will work across programs to motivate engagement and collaboration, support resource sharing, and disseminate knowledge and resources to the broader scientific community. The MC2 Center will operate through three hubs. The Collaboration Hub will use evidence-based strategies to catalyze interactions and new collaborations. An evaluation framework will be developed with quantitative and qualitative metrics to ensure the center continuously improves its impact. Community engagement activities will include working groups, special interest groups, DREAM Challenges, and Ideation Jams, all of which will have mechanisms for ensuring inclusion and promoting diversity. To facilitate sharing of resources from DCB programs, the Resource Coordination Hub will ensure all resources are findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR); it will identify or develop open and FAIR standards and best practices; provide training on how to implement these standards and practices in the cancer research community; and provide tooling and interfaces to facilitate resource sharing, curation, and deposition in public repositories. Finally, the Outreach Hub will enhance dissemination of knowledge and resources through training materials to maximize utilization of tools and short courses and workshops that bring concepts and resources from across the DCB programs together, enabling the broader community to experience the power of an integrative interdisciplinary approach to cancer. The Cancer Complexity Knowledge Portal will continue to provide open access to all data, tools, and other resources generated through the DCB and MC2, highlighting discoveries and enabling exploration into the many valuable resources generated by DCB programs.",2022-09-14T12:09:00Z,2027-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-21-049,nofo_RFA-CA-21-049,SAGE BIONETWORKS,SEATTLE,WA,UNITED STATES,csbc
U24CA274582,GARDE: Scalable Clinical Decision Support for Individualized Cancer Risk Management,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Evidence supports individualizing risk-stratified cancer screening, with selective application of specific screening interventions best suited to the individual. Yet, individualizing cancer screening at a population scale requires the implementation of personalized risk assessments which are quite challenging to achieve in today’s overwhelmed primary care settings. A promising approach to address this challenge is to automate the identification and management of eligible patients using electronic health record (EHR) technologies coupled with advanced clinical decision support (CDS) tools and automated conversational agents (“chatbots”). In previous research funded by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Informatics Technology for Cancer Research (ITCR) program, we have enabled GARDE (Genetic Cancer Risk Detector), a standards-based CDS platform for individualized cancer screening. GARDE (i) screens and identifies patients who meet National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) criteria for genetic testing based on their family history and other risk factors in the EHR; and (ii) uses automated chatbots offering patient outreach and education, offering access to genetic testing and explanation of test results. GARDE has been integrated with two market-leading EHR systems (Epic® and Cerner®) using the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) and CDS Hooks standards. GARDE has been successfully deployed in clinical settings at two academic medical centers and their respective cancer centers (University of Utah/Huntsman Cancer Institute and New York University) in support of the BRIDGE trial, funded by the NCI Cancer Moonshot program (U01CA232826 – Kaphingst, PI). The overall objective of the present proposal is to enhance and disseminate GARDE across healthcare systems including high resource medical centers and low resource safety net healthcare systems. Our approach will be guided by implementation science frameworks that help assess implementation readiness, identify barriers and facilitators, identify needs for adaptation, and develop implementation strategies. Specifically, we will (i) enhance GARDE’s chatbots using open-source technologies; (ii) deploy GARDE at new collaborating sites (Cornell University, Medical University of South Carolina [MUSC], Beaufort Memorial Hospital); (iii) conduct rapid iterative pilot implementations at these new sites; (iv) iteratively develop and test an implementation toolkit based on experience with the pilot sites; (v) conduct a cost analysis to catalyze further adoption; and (vi) disseminate GARDE beyond the collaborating sites through the implementation toolkit and direct technical assistance. Through wide dissemination, GARDE has the potential to enable evidence-based individualized cancer screening and reduce cancer burden through a scalable, population-based, and interoperable approach.",2023-09-01T12:09:00Z,2028-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-22-023,nofo_RFA-CA-22-023,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,SALT LAKE CITY,UT,UNITED STATES,itcr
U24CA274633,The cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics,"PROJECT SUMMARY Genomic sequencing of tumor samples is now a routine component of cancer care, providing unprecedented insight into cancer initiation, progression, and treatment effects. Additionally, novel molecular profiling and imaging techniques are gaining traction, generating ever more data. Ensuring that these data sets are easily accessible and interpretable to scientists and clinicians is of vital importance. Towards this end, we seek to evolve and expand the capabilities of the cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics, a unique platform that enables interactive exploratory analysis of large-scale cancer genomic data. The cBioPortal is the most widely used and most highly cited tool within the cancer genomics community. The public site, with data from 325 cancer studies, is accessed by >34,000 unique users each month. The cBioPortal instance that supports AACR Project GENIE, a multi-institutional data sharing initiative, now hosts genomic profiles from >120,000 tumors. Since the software is available under an open source license, >65 cancer centers and pharmaceutical companies have institutional installations of cBioPortal to analyze their own data. Multiple institutions are making contributions to the software, including the five that are part of this application (Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, and Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia). To ensure that this vital resource continues to aid the cancer research community and to keep pace with the rapidly advancing fields of cancer genomics and precision cancer medicine, including the continuing increase in the number of profiled tumor samples, we propose to actively sustain and evolve the cBioPortal platform. Specifically, we plan to make improvements across the entire cBioPortal software architecture (Aim 1); this includes significant changes to address key performance bottlenecks, a new API capable of supporting federated queries, a new App Store, and improvements to our cloud infrastructure and data pipelines. We will also support several new molecular data types, add two entirely new cBioPortal views, develop new features for precision oncology, and improve general usability (Aim 2). We propose to continue funding a group of core developers across five institutions, expand the base of code contributors, and continue to collaborate with The Hyve to support biotech and pharmaceutical companies (Aim 3). Finally, to maximize use in the scientific community, we plan to continue to improve community outreach, user support, and training (Aim 4). These improvements will be necessary to ensure that cBioPortal continues to provide an essential service for cancer research and development of new biomarkers and drugs, especially as more cancer centers are using the cBioPortal as part of their precision medicine programs, and as pharmaceutical companies are using it for internal research. We expect that, over the next few years, the cBioPortal will continue to have a strong impact on all areas of cancer research and patient care.",2022-09-05T12:09:00Z,2027-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-21-016,nofo_RFA-CA-21-016,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,NEW YORK,NY,UNITED STATES,itcr
U24CA275417,CASCADE Coordinating Center,"Project Summary/Abstract Women living with HIV (WLWH) have a higher risk for acquisition, persistence, and progression of cervical human papillomavirus (HPV) to precancerous lesions, which, in the absence of effective screening and treatment services, can progress to invasive cancer at five-to-six times higher rates than in women without HIV. The massive global mobilization of humanitarian resources spanning over the past couple of decades, through initiatives such as the US President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), has resulted in millions of WLWH in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) now accessing affordable antiretroviral therapy and consequently living longer lives. Yet, their risk for cervical cancer continues unabated since effective screening and pre-cancer treatment services remain unavailable in most LMICs. The HIV/Cervical Cancer Prevention “CASCADE” Clinical Trials Network plans to conduct pragmatic clinical trials evaluating the effectiveness of clinically proven interventions to optimize the cervical cancer screening, management, and pre-cancer treatment cascade for WLWH. These clinical trials will be conducted in intended- use environments in resource-constrained settings in LMICs and in regions with health disparities in the United States. The CASCADE Network will have four major scientific focus areas: increasing screening uptake, improving management of screen positives, facilitating pre-cancer treatment access, and optimizing pre-cancer treatment for cervical cancer prevention in WLWH. The CASCADE Network clinical trials will focus on the measurement of the clinical effectiveness of interventions in intended use settings while gathering crucial information informing the implementation and scale-up of such interventions across the cascade of screening and pre-cancer treatment for WLWH. Such hybrid effectiveness-implementation designs will primarily focus on clinical effectiveness endpoints such as HPV positivity rates and/or pre-cancer detection/incidence/recurrence rates and will secondarily gather data on implementation-informing aspects such as costs, acceptability, and intervention fidelity while studying implementation strategy. To support the CASCADE Clinical Trials Network in partnership with the NCI's Division of Cancer Prevention, CASCADE Research Bases and CASCADE Clinical Sites, the CASCADE Network Coordinating Center will (i) provide overall network coordination and facilitate scientific review of network clinical trial concepts and protocols, (ii) provide centralized support for data management for network clinical trials, and (iii) conduct independent risk-appropriate auditing of network clinical trials.

U24CA277825,"The Data, Evaluation, and Coordination Center (DECC) for Connecting Underrepresented Populations to Clinical Trials (CUSP2CT)","Project Summary Despite the decline in overall mortality and incidence of cancer in the US population, disparities in cancer care still largely exist within certain groups. One key barrier causing the lack of proportional representation of these groups is the lack of dedicated efforts employing scientific rigorous approaches and implementation strategies for increasing their proportional representation in clinical trials. The Connecting Underrepresented Populations to Clinical Trials (CUSP2CT) program aims to implement and evaluate multilevel and culturally tailored outreach and education interventions that will increase the accrual of underrepresented populations in clinical trials. To support the CUSP2CT program, we are proposing to be the Data, Evaluation, and Coordination Center (DECC) to support the data and evaluation activities and coordinate a learning collaborative towards mitigating the key barriers of cancer disparity. Specifically, we will collaborate with the CUSP2CT U01 investigators and interact with involved NCI staff members and with other stakeholders, as needed, to carry out the following activities: 1) establish effective and efficient administrative processes and infrastructure through scientific leadership, organizational processes, governance structure, effective oversight and operational procedures to achieve optimal communication, collaboration, coordination, and dissemination of the CUSP2CT research, 2) facilitate and coordinate data collection and management across the CUSP2CT program to facilitate evidence generation and rapid dissemination of methods and tools, 3) organize and facilitate collaborative efforts on program evaluation, engagement, and communication, and 4) foster a learning collaborative in leading and coordinating trans-CUSP2CT research. We are uniquely positioned to be the DECC for CUSP2T leveraging strong track record in: (i) implementing health equity centers and consortia (e.g. Dr. Odedina is MPI on NCI CRCHD U54 CaRE2 Health Equity Center and contact MPI for a newly awarded Department of Defense iCCaRE for Black Men Consortium); (ii) leading statistics and data management coordinating center effort in cancer trials (e.g., Mayo is the Statistics and Data Management Center of the Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology (Alliance) including both interventional and NCORP grants); (ii) leading standardization and interoperability for practice and research (e.g., Mayo has been contributing to the NCI Terminology Service Development Effort and part of the data harmonization efforts in the NCATS Clinical Data to Health (CD2H)).

U24CA279629,Privacy-Aware Federated Learning for Breast Cancer Risk Assessment,"ABSTRACT: Federated learning (FL) has gained a lot of attention recently, as it enables analyses of data from numerous collaborating sites without the need to share data, i.e., each collaborator’s data are always retained within their site. FL is advantageous as it can: 1) overcome cultural/ownership, privacy, and regulatory concerns (since data never leave the local site), 2) provide access to restricted data, 3) allow the collection of meaningful amounts of data for analyses of rare diseases, and 4) address health disparities and inequities. Thus, FL can be noted as a novel paradigm for multi-site collaborations, enabling access to ample and importantly diverse data, essential to developing robust models generalizable in unseen data. To this end, we have developed the Federated Tumor Segmentation (FeTS) platform and the Open Federated Learning (OpenFL) library, as open-source tools with a commercially friendly license that have facilitated a) the largest to-date real-world federation, involving 3D brain tumor MRI data from 71 sites across 6 continents, and b) the very first computational challenge in FL, forming the first benchmarking environment and dataset in the field. This FeTS-OpenFL infrastructure has further been used to c) identify tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in histopathology images and d) segment dense tissue in 2D digital mammography (DM), highlighting its generalizability in different imaging and disease types. Building upon our successful FeTS-OpenFL infrastructure, we propose to enhance its functionality with new developments on privacy-aware FL towards classification workloads and evaluate it on a first-of-its-kind use case on breast cancer (BC) risk assessment. BC is the most diagnosed cancer in the US, the 2nd leading cause of death from cancer in women, and screening is performed routinely with 2D digital mammography (DM) for women in their 40s-50s. However, DM yields a lot of false positives and unnecessary subsequent procedures. To alleviate these issues, 3D Digital Breast Tomosynthesis (DBT) has been developed and increasingly replacing DM. Our group has developed novel volumetric breast density (VBD) measures from DBT scans. Building upon our team’s collective pioneering work in FL and BC risk assessment, in this proposal we focus on developing a trustworthy, zero-code principle FL framework for training AI-based classification models and built-in functionality to i) generate realistic synthetic data, matching local population characteristics, for data augmentation & privacy preservation, and ii) automatically determine quantitative & interpretable settings of optimal privacy preservation. We will use this framework to perform the largest to-date evaluation of training deep-learning models for BC risk assessment using DBT VBD measures and other established risk factors while leveraging multi-site, ethnically diverse data of women undergoing BC screening. We will also disseminate resources via distribution of source code, deployment to collaborating sites, and organization of training activities. Our overarching goal is an easy-to-use translatable trustworthy FL framework, lowering the barrier for under-served populations to participate in large- scale FL studies, and paving the way to address health disparities, towards accelerating discovery healthcare.",2023-09-20T12:09:00Z,2028-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-22-023,nofo_RFA-CA-22-023,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,INDIANAPOLIS,IN,UNITED STATES,itcr
U2CCA233195,The Cellular Geography of Therapeutic Resistance in Cancer,"Most patients who die from cancer do so because their cancer is resistant to available therapies, either intrinsically, or as it evolves in response to treatment. However, the fundamental mechanisms driving resistance remain largely unknown. Tumors are comprised of a complex multicellular ecosystem of malignant and non- malignant cells, and changes in their composition, states, spatial organization and interactions are central to therapeutic resistance. Thus, there is an enormous need to chart an atlas of a tumor's cells, their spatial organization and interactions as those change dynamically in resistance to therapy. Technological breakthroughs in spatial and single-cell genomics, including many innovations by our team, now put an atlas within reach, but harnessing this remarkable opportunity, requires collection of multiple spatial and single cell genomics data in clinical samples; novel study design strategies; new experimental and computational strategies to integrate across cellular and spatial data; algorithms to construct tumor atlases that capture the resistant state; and showing how to use an atlas to formulate and test new predictive models of resistance. The Boston Human Tumor Atlas Network Research Center (HTA-RC) will address each of these challenges by creating three comprehensive atlases of the cellular geography of human cancer to understand how changes in the tumor ecosystem lead to therapeutic resistance in: (1) Primary and acquired resistance to CDK4/6 inhibition in breast cancer; (2) Primary and acquired resistance to immune checkpoint blockade in metastatic melanoma; and (3) Primary resistance to immunotherapy in microsatellite stable (MSS) colorectal carcinoma (CRC) compared with microsatellite instable (MSI) CRC. All three tumors types tackle an unmet clinical need; have an approximately equal rate of resistance and response to allow comparisons between states; and harness significant clinical experience and build on substantial preliminary results at our center. To construct the atlases, we will collect at least 100 biospecimens per year from resections and biopsies of the three tumor types and analyze them with histopathological data, high-resolution spatial multiplex RNA and protein data, single- cell genomics data, and temporal clinical data. Our algorithms will recover key features of each data modality, and integrate them into a single atlas to determine what predicts and underlies resistance. We build on a well-established interdisciplinary team in two major cancer centers (DFCI, MGH) and four research institutions (Broad, Harvard, Stanford, Princeton). Our leadership (Haining, Regev) and Units comprise of foremost experts and pioneers in clinical genomics (Biospecimens; Johnson, Wagle), spatial and single cell genomics (Shalek, Rozenblatt-Rosen, Nolan, Zhuang), and computational biology and data science (Regev, Van Allen, Engelhardt). Our atlases will allow identification of predictive biomarkers of resistance in the tumor ecosystem, and therapeutic target discovery, targeting diverse facets of the complex tumor ecosystem.",2018-09-24T12:09:00Z,2024-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-17-034,nofo_RFA-CA-17-034,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,BOSTON,MA,UNITED STATES,htan
U2CCA233238,The Lung PCA: A Multi-Dimensional Atlas of Pulmonary Premalignancy,"Abstract: Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide chiefly due to our inability to detect the disease at its earliest stage and the lack of interventions to prevent its development in those at highest risk. The rate-limiting step to developing new approaches for lung cancer detection and prevention is our lack of understanding of the earliest molecular and cellular changes associated with lung carcinogenesis. We propose to develop a high-resolution, multidimensional genetic, molecular, and cellular atlas of pre-cancerous lung lesions and their surrounding microenvironment for lung squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma, the two most common subtypes of lung cancer. We will leverage unique retrospective and prospective cohorts assembled at multiple medical centers via our Biospecimen Unit to collect, annotate, and process premalignant lesion biospecimens of the lung and airway. Our Characterization Unit will apply existing and emerging molecular profiling tools to characterize the genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic landscape of these lesions. Pipelines for standardized multidimensional data processing, quality control, analysis and integration will be developed by our Data Analysis Unit, leading to creation of a web-based portal for data dissemination and online integrative analysis to benefit the greater research community. Cross-sectional sampling of premalignant squamous and adenomatous lesions adjacent to early stage cancer will enable development of a spatial map that will provide insights into the evolution of premalignant cells and their microenvironment. Our longitudinal study of airway premalignant squamous lesions that progress toward or regress away from invasive carcinoma will provide both a temporal and spatial map of the molecular determinants of invasive carcinoma. We will also leverage this longitudinal study to demonstrate the clinical utility of our Lung Pre- Cancer Atlas through development of prognostic biomarkers of premalignant progression that can be applied clinically for precision management, as well as to stratify patients with aggressive premalignant squamous lesions into early-phase intervention trials. Successful completion of the Atlas will be accelerated by: (1) a highly-coordinated Administrative Core that will facilitate interactions within and across Units, as well as the exchange of data, methods, and tools with other centers within the HTAN; and (2) partnerships with ongoing NCI, foundation, and industry lung premalignancy initiatives. Our Lung Pre-Cancer Atlas will ultimately serve as a resource for the medical and scientific communities to enable the development of biomarkers for early detection and risk stratification, as well as identification of novel targets for therapies that will intercept the development of lung cancer.",2018-09-30T12:09:00Z,2024-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-17-035,nofo_RFA-CA-17-035,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,BOSTON,MA,UNITED STATES,htan
U2CCA233254,Breast Pre-Cancer Atlas Center,"ABSTRACT – Overall Development of invasive breast cancer may frequently progress through a preinvasive precursor called ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). DCIS is an extremely common clinical diagnosis that is essentially a disease of screening triggered by the detection of abnormal breast calcifications on mammography. Before the advent of mammography, DCIS was an incidental and relatively uncommon finding. Over 60,000 women in the United States will be presented with this diagnosis each year with relatively weak evidence-based guidance for disease management which ranges from active surveillance to bilateral mastectomy. We propose to compile multi-dimensional and multi-scale information on DCIS to construct a Pre-Cancer Atlas that can be used to better understand the disease but also to better stratify risk of progression, a useful translational endpoint. To do this, we have assembled a team of investigators with deep and complementary clinical, experimental, and quantitative expertise and experience with DCIS and breast cancer in general. Further, we conduct these studies with full consideration of tumor evolution and ecology as it pertains to precancer development and progression. Specific aspects of the proposed Atlas construction include: 1) Several types of DCIS cohorts that will capture spatial and longitudinal information including a prospective clinical trial cohort undergoing active surveillance, 2) Analyses designed to maintain relevant spatial organization of the disease for evolutionary and Atlas building considerations based on 3) Radiologic-histologic-cellular-molecular registration approaches, 4) Characterization at multiple scales including whole tumor, single duct and single cell levels, 5) Characterization of relevant parameters including mutations, copy number changes, methylation, gene expression, and microenvironmental elements including inflammatory cell profiles. 6) Incorporation of the breast cancer intrinsic subtype paradigm into the analytic phase, and 7) Layered, spatial, and longitudinal data visualization. Overall, this work will provide a comprehensive platform to guide the next generation of studies on DCIS and other precancers.",2018-09-21T12:09:00Z,2024-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-17-035,nofo_RFA-CA-17-035,DUKE UNIVERSITY,DURHAM,NC,UNITED STATES,htan
U2CCA233262,Pre-cancer atlases of cutaneous and hematologic origin (PATCH Center),"SUMMARY-ABSTRACT The overall goal of this proposal is to construct two pre-cancer atlases (PCAs) from highly accessible pre- malignant diseases that impose high burdens on human health (i) one focused on progression of pre- melanoma lesions to invasive cancer and (ii) a second on progression from clonal hematopoiesis (CHIP) to myeloid neoplasms. Both of these involve expansion of specific clones in normal and diseased niches as shaped by complex interactions among immune and pre-cancer cells. The resulting Atlases developed by the Center for Pre-cancer Atlases of Cutaneous and Hematologic Origin (PATCH Center) present complementary technical challenges, avenues to scientific discovery, and opportunities for the development of precision prevention strategies and therapies. The key goal in both cases is to precisely delineate and understand the molecular mechanisms driving progression from pre-malignant to malignant disease, to identify high risk individuals, prioritize particular therapies and serve as the foundation for precision prevention clinical trials. This will be achieved by integrated characterization of single cell genotype and cell states using high-plex tissue imaging and omic characterization of cross-sectional and well-controlled longitudinal patient cohorts. Aim 1 will establish an administrative core responsible for scientific management of the Center, coordination with HTAN members and dissemination of Atlases under the direction of an internal Executive Committee with three subcommittees. Aim 2 will establish a Biospecimen Unit under the leadership of pathologists, oncologists and a surgeon. The DFCI Pasquarello Tissue Repository will provide highly annotated hematological specimens for image-based and omic characterization of CHIP; the BWH dermatopathologic tissue repository will provide annotated FFPE samples for melanoma precursors. These services will also play a key role in prospective sample acquisition and analysis. Aim 3 will establish a Characterization Unit directed by an oncologist and pathologist to perform and integrate single-cell genomics, multiplex flow cytometry and high- plex imaging using two methods reduced to practice within the Center: tissue-based cyclic immunofluorescence (t-CyCIF) and DNA exchange imaging (DEI). The Characterization Unit will also validate reagents and associate all primary results with appropriate metadata, protocols and reagent specifications. Aim 4 will establish a Data Analysis Unit enlisting systems and computational biologists and data scientists to manage all aspects of data acquisition, interpretation and visualization. This is expected to be the most technically challenging aspect of the Atlas projects. The Data Analysis Unit will release Phase I/II atlases each in preliminary and final stages to facilitate collaborative and crowd-sourced approaches to algorithm development. The resulting human browsable and machine-readable atlases are expected to yield new scientific discoveries, demonstrate the feasibility and utility of new technologies and help to reduce the incidence of life-threatening cancers of the skin and blood.",2018-09-30T12:09:00Z,2024-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-17-035,nofo_RFA-CA-17-035,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,BOSTON,MA,UNITED STATES,htan
U2CCA233280,Omic and Multidimensional Spatial Atlas of Metastatic Breast and Prostate Cancers,"ABSTRACT - Overall We propose to create an Omic and Multidimensional Spatial (OMS) Atlas that will enable discovery of mechanisms of resistance that arise in individual patients with metastatic breast and prostate cancer during treatment with current generation targeted therapeutic combinations and immune checkpoint inhibitors. The OMS Atlas is motivated by the fact that these treatments typically are only transiently effective in the metastatic setting. Possible resistance mechanisms may be intrinsic to the tumor cells or derive from the diverse microenvironments in which the tumor cells live. The OMS Atlas will focus on elucidating these resistance mechanisms in three specific current generation clinical scenarios: (a) hormone-receptor positive breast cancer (HRBC) undergoing treatment with a CDK4/6 inhibitor in combination with endocrine therapy, (b) triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) undergoing treatment with a PARP inhibitor and an immunomodulatory agent, and (c) castration resistance prostate cancer (CRPC) undergoing treatment with enzalutamide. We will accomplish this through work in four areas. A Biospecimen Unit will prospectively collect, manage, and distribute longitudinal clinical information, blood, and biopsies from 20 patients from each of two metastatic breast cancer cohorts and one prostate cancer cohort that will be analyzed to create three OMS Atlases. The biopsies will be preserved to enable analyses using multiple characterization modalities. A Characterization Unit will analyze (a) OCT frozen specimens using Topographic Single Cell Sequencing (TSCS) and Single-cell Combinatorial Indexing ATAC- seq (sci-ATAC-seq) to elucidate spatially defined genomic changes and chromatin accessibility in single cells, (b) formalin fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) specimens using multiplex immunohistochemistry (mIHC) to assess the immune microenvironment and cyclic Immunofluorescence (cycIF) to assess the composition and molecular states of tumor cells and their microenvironments, and (c) paraformaldehyde fixed, resin embedded (PFRE) specimens using a Focused Ion Beam Scanning Electron Microscope (FIB-SEM) to identify ultrastructural changes in 2D images and targeted 3D images with 4-nm resolution. Omic characterization of the same tumor samples will be provided by the SMMART Program. A Data Analysis Unit will develop and deploy tools to (a) manage, analyze, and visualize Tier 1 data comprised of raw sequence data and images to generate unimodal Tier 2 results, (b) integrate omics and imaging data through crosswise mapping to create single timepoint tumor maps and quantify systems biological functions of tumor cellular subpopulations to generate Tier 3 results, and (c) explore differences between pre- and on/post-treatment tumor maps to reveal mechanisms of resistance that comprise Tier 4 results. We will collaborate with private sector partners to evaluate and adopt next generation technologies that increase analytical power and speed and reduce costs. The Administrative Unit will facilitate the coordination, operation, interaction, and evaluation of activities within the OMS Atlas and between OMS Atlas scientists and the HTAN.",2018-09-19T12:09:00Z,2024-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-17-034,nofo_RFA-CA-17-034,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,PORTLAND,OR,UNITED STATES,htan
U2CCA233284,"Transition to Metastatic State: Lung Cancer, Pancreatic Cancer and Brain Metastasis","PROJECT SUMMARY (Overall Unit) Metastasis embodies the dynamic, complex, whole-organism pathophysiology of cancer. Spread of cancer cells beyond the primary tumor site is the cause of the majority of cancer deaths and the most overt expression of cancer's complex evolutionary dynamics. Intimately related to the intricate processes of development and immunity, the transition from locally invasive to metastatic cancer poses a major scientific hurdle. Recent technological and computational advancements, pioneered by our team enable dynamic, multi-dimensional, multi-planar analysis of multiple tissues. Applying these advances to the most lethal cancers in the US: Lung Cancer, Pancreatic Cancer and CNS metastases, we will generate a Human Tissue Atlas with unprecedented spatial-temporal resolution. This multidisciplinary effort begins with an unparalleled array of human tissues and clinical data acquired by our Biospecimen Unit team. These high-quality biospecimens will be obtained from lung cancer, pancreatic cancer and CNS metastases obtained from surgical resections, biopsy or autopsy. The Data Analysis Unit will then subject these specimens will be subjected to multi-dimensional analysis including bulk DNA sequencing, single cell and single nuclear RNA sequencing, as well as architecturally- sensitive analyses including MIBI (protein) and MERFISH (RNA) technologies. Driven by revolutionary computational and systems biologists, integration and presentation of these datasets will be undertaken by the Characterization Unit, with the goal of generating authoritative human tumor atlases of value to the entire cancer research community.",2018-09-30T12:09:00Z,2024-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-17-034,nofo_RFA-CA-17-034,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,NEW YORK,NY,UNITED STATES,htan
U2CCA233285,Center for pediatric tumor cell atlas,"PROJECT SUMMARY - OVERALL Childhood Cancer is the second most common causes of childhood deaths. Cancers in children are highly distinct from those in adults. Causes, mechanisms and therapeutic approaches cannot be extrapolated from the study of adult malignancies. To impact the burden of pediatric cancers requires the specific study of pediatric cancers. We therefore propose the in depth characterization of three specific subtypes of pediatric malignancies which, together, account for over 50% of all pediatric cancer deaths: high grade glioma (pHGG), high risk neuroblastoma (NB), and very high risk acute lymphoblastic B-cell precursor leukemia (VHR-ALL). All three tumor types share a characteristic of typically initial response to therapy, followed by the emergence of resistance and refractory disease. We will map molecular and cellular changes in tumor cells, microenvironment and the immune system using comprehensive multi-dimensional single-cell and in situ technologies associated with two critical transitions: initial response, and emergence of resistant disease – both high-priority transitions. Treatment modalities will include standard chemotherapy, molecular targeted therapies and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR-) T cell therapy, capturing the cutting edge of current cancer therapy. The final product will impact global childhood cancer research in the following manner: 1) Tumor Atlases: atlases will provide a highly user friendly, publicly available, searchable database of the most comprehensive multi-omic, single cell analysis of the three most lethal childhood cancers. Molecular data will be richly annotated with access to additional pathological evaluation, clinical and outcomes data, and grant access to source data such tumor imaging. 2) Computational methods: in addition to the data, the critical computational tools and pipelines used in this project will be available to the research community. These include methods and pipelines for processing multi-omics and in situ data, inference of cancer phylogeny, inference of cell- and clone-specific pathways, methods for inferring cell-cell crosstalk, as well as database algorithms for the query, exploration and visualization of highly complex data. 3) Access to biospecimens for follow up studies: biospecimens collected in this project will be banked and made available to the biomedical research community. These include tissue sections, viably frozen specimen, and patient derived xenograft (PDX models). In summary, the proposed project will seek to address a major public health need in pediatrics, broadly impact the entire research community, and jumpstart target discovery based on a sophisticated understanding of the key molecular circuits that drive pediatric cancer.",2018-09-30T12:09:00Z,2024-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-17-034,nofo_RFA-CA-17-034,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,PHILADELPHIA,PA,UNITED STATES,htan
U2CCA233291,Integrative Single-Cell Atlas of Host and Microenvironment in Colorectal Neoplastic Transformation,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Overall Colorectal cancer (CRC) is among the top three most prevalent cancers in global incidence and mortality. Most of these cancers develop from pre-cancerous adenomas. Colonoscopy is currently the most effective CRC prevention strategy. However, colonoscopy may fail to prevent carcinoma in as many as 24% of cases, is less effective at preventing proximal CRCs, is expensive for health care systems to implement, carries economic and psychosocial burdens for patients, and can be complicated by bleeding, perforation, and other adverse events. There is an unmet need to develop new preventive strategies and risk stratification models to address these and other issues. By analysis of whole human tissue, seminal work from Bert Vogelstein and co-workers demonstrated that CRC develops from an accumulation of genetic events as tumors evolve from small to large adenomas and, eventually, to cancers. More recently, our group reported the first comprehensive proteogenomic characterization of CRC, which also was from a bulk analysis of whole tissue Despite this wealth of data on CRC, we believe that the ability to provide the most effective precision diagnostics and preventive strategies can only be achieved with single-cell analysis. Through such a single-cell analysis, we propose to map spatial relationships across the spectrum of normal colon, early polyps, and late adenomas, including their unique stromal and microbial microenvironments. Aim 1: To construct a pre-cancer atlas of colorectal adenoma progression that depicts the spatial landscape of the tumor ecosystem, including the stroma and biofilm-associated microbiome, using single-cell (sc)RNA-seq, whole exome sequencing, multiplex immunofluorescence (MxIF), and species-specific bacterial fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Aim 2: To integrate the activities and data from the Biospecimen, Tissue Characterization and Data Analysis Units for the prospective standardized collection and analysis of colorectal tissue, associated biospecimens, and related clinical and epidemiological data from 1,800 participants undergoing colonoscopy or surgical resection. Aim 3: To disseminate the pre-cancer atlas, related biospecimens, primary data sets and analytical tools to the Human Tumor Atlas Network (HTAN), the broader scientific community, and the lay public. To accomplish these aims, we have assembled a highly interactive and established team of investigators with complementary expertise (epidemiologists, gastroenterologists, pathologists, surgeons, systems biologists, bioinformaticians, cancer biologists, immunologists, and biofilms/infectious disease experts). To further optimize our novel methodologies for application to the prospectively collected samples from 1,800 atlas participants, we will leverage our existing large repository of colorectal adenomas and supporting biospecimens, generated and curated through an ongoing epidemiological project through 3 cycles of the Vanderbilt GI Special Programs of Research Excellence (SPORE). We are confident that our application, in toto, is greater than the sum of its parts, and we look forward to robust bi-directional interactions with HTAN.",2018-09-20T12:09:00Z,2024-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-17-035,nofo_RFA-CA-17-035,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,NASHVILLE,TN,UNITED STATES,htan
U2CCA233303,Washington University Human Tumor Atlas Research Center,"Project Summary/Abstract: Overall Diverse areas of cancer research have progressed to the point that it is now feasible to meaningfully integrate research data and clinical information across the molecular, cellular, and tissue realms into a larger, more detailed picture of the onco-dynamics of cancer, including spatial-temporal details during cancer treatment and progression. Physicians and researchers at Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM) and the Siteman Cancer Center (WUSM-SCC) are longtime leaders in the allied sub-disciplines of cancer, including genomics, proteomics, imaging, functional characterization, pathology, clinical trials, and clinical care. WUSM- SCC is an NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center, which sees ~9,000 new cancer patients annually. Building on our expertise, established infrastructure, large patient population, and extraordinary institutional commitment, we propose to develop the Washington University Human Tumor Atlas Research Center (WU- HTARC) within the NIH Human Tumor Analysis Network (HTAN). We will focus on generating organ-specific human tumor atlases for three high priority cancer types associated with exceptionally poor prognosis: the triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), glioblastoma (GBM), and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Collectively, we will analyze ~1,600-2000 samples collected from spatially separated locations and at different time points along the clinical treatment course from 300-375 patients (selected from ~750 recruited patients) for the duration of the project. In addition to standard histopathological analyses, bulk DNA/RNA sequencing, proteomics, and clinical imaging, etc., we will conduct cutting-edge, comprehensive analyses, including single cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq), multiplexed immunofluorescent protein localization (MxIF), mass cytometry/Cytometry by Time of Flight (CyTOF) cellular characterization, metabolomics analysis, innovative imaging, and 3-D modeling. We have established infrastructure covering the aforementioned areas, from specimen procurement (Biospecimen Unit), to multidisciplinary analyses modules (Characterization Unit), and to analysis pipelines (Data Analysis Unit). Data generated from this study will be valuable for revealing the clonal evolution of the tumor cells from longitudinally collected specimens and to reconstruct the tumor ecosystem involving non- cancer cells and acellular structures. Our atlases will have comprehensive data integration at the 3D level over time, providing unprecedented 4D models for the 3 selected cancer types. Our established infrastructure and continuous efforts in incorporating new technologies in omics, imaging, and informatics, will help ensure our atlases will be the state-of-the-art, taking full advantage of the latest progress in these fields and will continue to evolve beyond the pilot phase to facilitate cancer research and improve clinical care. The proposed atlases target a set of critically important clinical questions, including tumor resistance that has long been a challenge for GBM treatment and also an important clinical problem in BRCA/TNBC and PDAC, in which minority populations are disproportionately affected. Other emphases are BRCA response/resistance to chemotherapy, PDAC metastasis, and GBM local recurrence in conjunction with resistance to therapy. These atlases can cross reference each other for pan-cancer analyses. We will also seek to cooperate with any Pre- Cancer Atlas (PCA) centers studying these disease types to maximize the temporal continuity of research on these cancers. The similarities and differences among the three selected cancer types will provide synergy among the three atlases and will also allow us to accumulate valuable knowledge in atlas building for other cancer types. The data, specimens, and experience gained by our center will be shared with HTAN and the broader research community to foster the next important discoveries in personalized cancer medicine.",2018-09-30T12:09:00Z,2024-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-17-034,nofo_RFA-CA-17-034,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,SAINT LOUIS,MO,UNITED STATES,htan
U2CCA233311,Precancer Atlas of Familial Adenomatous Polyposis,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third highest cause of cancer death in the United States. Almost 80% of sporadic colorectal cancers have an APC gene mutation. Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), a hereditary colon cancer syndrome, is also caused by mutations in APC and affects children as young as 7 years of age. FAP causes hundreds of colonic polyps in affected individuals and a 100% lifetime risk of CRC. In preliminary efforts we have successfully collected hundreds of pre-cancerous colon polyps from individual FAP patients, applied genomic, epigenomic and other multi-omic analyses and begun to elucidate the impact of multiple types of “omic” alterations on precancerous colon polyp evolution toward CRC. We propose to use an integrated and collaborative approach to develop a PreCancer Atlas for colorectal adenocarcinoma using FAP as the disease model. We will: 1) Establish a biospecimen collection pipeline for procurement of longitudinal tissue samples during surveillance colonoscopy and during prophylactic surgical colectomy, including whole blood, serum, normal colonic tissue, colon microbiome, benign pre-cancerous polyps, dysplastic precancerous polyps and colon adenocarcinomas. The material will be used for our own center and will also be available to the Human Tumor Atlas Network (HTAN). Medical records, longitudinal samples and all relevant metadata will also be collected. 2) Establish a center to characterize the tissue samples with state-of-the-art omics and imaging technologies. These include but are not limited to whole genome sequencing, methylation, transcriptome, proteome, cytokine, metabolome, microbiome, and molecular imaging. 3) Establish an analysis core that analyzes and integrates results from -omics, imaging and medical information, builds a spatiotemporal, multidimensional, integrative multi-omics cancer atlas, and develops longitudinal and predictive models for PreCancer biology and progression, as well as data portal and visualization framework. 4) Establish multi-omics technologies on smaller number of samples. 5) Perform a “multiscale deep data analysis” on a large number of samples (57) from a few people and a fewer number of samples (6) from many people. Use this information to guide additional data collection. 6) Identify factors (e.g. germline genetics, microbiome, immune dysfunction) contributing to polyp heterogeneity between and across individuals. Build disease progression models based on these data. 7) Make all biospecimens, information, protocols and software available to the PCA, HTAN and the general scientific community. We expect our efforts will greatly facilitate understanding CRC at its earliest stages and serve as a model for understanding precancerous lesions of other solid tumor malignancies.",2018-09-30T12:09:00Z,2024-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-17-035,nofo_RFA-CA-17-035,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,STANFORD,CA,UNITED STATES,htan
U2CCA252971,USC PE-GCS: Optimizing Engagement of Hispanic Colorectal Cancer Patients in Cancer Genomic Characterization Studies,"ABSTRACT Colorectal Cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer death in the US. Hispanic/Latinos are the largest and fasting growing ethnic group in the US, and cancer is the leading cause of death among H/L in the US. Therefore, we need to fully understand the full complexity of the molecular etiology of cancer in this ethnic group. For instance, although incidence rates of CRC are lower among Latinos as compared to Whites or African Americans, Hispanics with metastatic disease have shorter overall survival when adjusted for health care setting, demographics, disease characteristics and treatment factors. H/L also tend to be diagnosed at a younger age and with higher stage, and we have previously reported that Mexican H/L in California have the greatest proportion of young (<50 years of age) diagnoses compared to other H/L subgroups. Moreover, Mexican H/L showed higher prevalence of rectal cancer cases compared to other H/L and NHW. Although socio-economics and access to care might influence these differences, we need to take a complete look at the biology of disease in this ethnic group to determine once and for all if these clinical differences are related to differences in molecular etiology. The Cancer Genome Atlas has provided a deep overview of the molecular taxonomy of CRC in 594 cases, however, less than 1% of the cases (n=5) were H/L. Therefore, it is imperative for us to take more detailed assessment of the molecular genomic landscape of CRC in H/L. One of the major issues likely limiting our ability to perform these large genomic initiatives in minority patients is that Patient or Participant Engagement practices may not been investigated to identify best practices for accruing and consenting patients into clinical translational biomedical research studies. This concept of Participant Engagement is critically important for both the patients and the translational cancer research community. Optimizing and improving our approaches for directly engaging patients at initial contact, throughout the course of a translational genomic study, and during the time of return of results is likely to lead to stronger relationships between the medical community and patients, but could also lead to significant improvement in outcomes for patients and for the cancer care community as a whole. As such, we propose the creation of the USC Center for Optimization of Participant Engagement in Cancer Characterization (COPECC) with a focus on optimizing the engagement of Latinos in CRC Genomic Characterization research studies. USC COPECC would serve as a member of the NCI U2C Participant Engagement and Cancer Genome Sequencing (PE-CGS) Network. Our investigative team includes experts in all relevant areas of research for genomic characterization, participant engagement, and engagement optimization. We have an established platform for consenting patients into cancer genomics studies that will serve as a standard process. The overall goal of USC COPECC is to generate results on participant engagement optimization and CRC genomic research that will be shared with the broader community to distribute best practices for engaging Latinos in hopes of improving overall outcomes for CRC in this underserved population.",2021-09-22T12:09:00Z,2027-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-19-045,nofo_CA19-045,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,Los Angeles,CA,UNITED STATES,pe_cgs
U2CCA252973,Engagement of American Indians of Southwestern Tribal Nations in Cancer Genome Sequencing,"While American Indian (AI) Tribes and communities are highly diverse in ethnicity, language, and culture, there is one unfortunate characteristic that they share: profound cancer health disparities. Compounded by disproportionately low rates of cancer screening and more limited access to healthcare, AI are more often diagnosed at later stages of disease and have the poorest outcomes in all types of cancer when compared to any other racial and ethnic group in the United States. The cause of these significant cancer health disparities is undoubtedly multifactorial. However, an unexplored factor is the molecular characterization of tumors arising in AI. American Indians and Alaska Natives (AN) have been strikingly understudied in The Cancer Genome Atlas Project (TCGA) and account for only < 0.5% of the cancer patients studied. Of the nearly 11,000 patients sequenced in TCGA to date, only 27 (0.25%) were identified as AI/AN. It is our hypothesis that through appropriate participant and community engagement and comprehensive genomic sequencing, we will discover novel somatic and germline mutations, differences in the spectrum and/or frequency of cancer-promoting mutations, and genome-wide mutational signatures reflective of behaviors and exposures, that can ultimately be translated to improved cancer screening, precision prevention, and therapeutic intervention in American Indian participants and communities. In this application, we will focus on the molecular characterization of cancers which show significant disparities in AI of the Southwest, including gastrointestinal and hepatobiliary cancers (stomach, colorectal, pancreatic, liver, gallbladder and biliary tree); genitourinary cancers (kidney, prostate cancer); and other hormone-dependent cancers (breast, ovarian cancers). Our Specific Aims are to develop culturally-appropriate, respectful, and trusted means to: 1) Engage American Indian participants (cancer patients and survivors) and their Tribal communities in participatory research studies of the molecular characterization of cancer, particularly focusing on cancers that display striking disparities in incidence and outcome in Southwest Tribal Nations; 2) Discover novel somatic and germline mutations and/or differences in the spectrum and frequency of cancer-promoting mutations, and genome-wide mutational signatures reflective of specific behaviors and exposures, in American Indian participants, relative to other racial and ethnic populations in the U.S. and the world; 3) Disseminate knowledge gained through these studies to Tribal participants and Tribal Councils, leaders, stakeholders, and communities using unique means of participant engagement and novel means of communication, such as visual arts and media, that are sensitive to cultural and religious beliefs and practices and that acknowledge the indigenous languages and dialects, many of which lack many scientific and medical terms for words and concepts such as cancer, gene, genomics, mutation, and DNA, and 4) (Share knowledge with the broader scientific community through the NCI Genome Data Commons and publication of scientific results in accordance with NIH Data Sharing Policies and Tribal Agreements.",2020-09-02T12:09:00Z,2027-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-19-045,nofo_CA19-045,UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO HEALTH SCIS CTR,ALBUQUERQUE,NM,UNITED STATES,pe_cgs
U2CCA252974,Count Me In: Partnering with patients to define the clinical and genomic landscape of rare aggressive sarcomas in children and adults,"Osteosarcoma (OS) and leiomyosarcoma (LMS) are exceedingly rare cancers, both subtypes of sarcoma, that arise in bone and smooth muscle respectively. There has been a failure to improve survival rates or decrease treatment-related morbidity in OS/LMS due to insufficient characterization of the genomic landscape, resulting in a lack of targeted therapeutic approaches, diagnostic methods, and preventive strategies. There is an urgent need for a large, shared database of clinical and genomic data in OS and LMS. Yet, because of the rarity of these tumor types as well as other challenges in patient recruitment and the genomic characterization of these tumors, to date it has been difficult to generate this data. The overarching goal of this proposal is to engage adult and pediatric participants with OS and LMS as partners to generate a shared database of clinical, genomic, molecular, and patient-reported data. This should accelerate discoveries that drive novel treatment strategies, new clinical trials, and new standards of care. The Count Me In PE-CGS U2C Research Center will leverage our experience in patient engagement, genome characterization, computational analysis, and behavioral research to create and launch two patient-partnered projects to generate this clinicogenomic data. We will build two websites with patients in the OS and LMS communities—the Osteosarcoma Project (OSproject) and the Leiomyosarcoma Project (LMSproject)—and consent 3,000 patients over the course of the study. We will collect medical records, patient-reported data, archival tumor tissue samples, and saliva and blood for genomic analysis. We will generate clinically annotated genomic data from at least 750 tumor specimens, 500 circulating tumor DNA specimens, and corresponding germline specimens and share the de-identified data widely. At the same time, we will study and optimize the approach to patient engagement in cancer research, particularly among rural and minority participants and participants across a range of literacy levels, ages, and stages in development. To accomplish these goals, we will build on a well-established interdisciplinary team from the Broad Institute and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute with members who have pioneered these approaches. Our leadership (Wagle, Janeway) and Units are comprised of experts in patient-partnered cancer research (Wagle, Painter), sarcoma clinical and translational research (Janeway, George, Crompton, Raut), genome characterization, analysis, and clinical interpretation (Gabriel, Getz, Van Allen, Wagle, Janeway), computational biology/data science (Getz, Van Allen, Philippakis), and behavioral science (Mack, Rebbeck). Our Center will uncover the key clinicogenomic features of OS/LMS, integrate them into a single comprehensive database with a goal of accelerating research and improving the lives of these patients. In doing so, we also aim to present a general approach to patient-partnered research that can be disseminated broadly and applied to other tumors types and patient communities.",2020-09-01T12:09:00Z,2026-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-19-045,nofo_CA19-045,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",CAMBRIDGE,MA,UNITED STATES,pe_cgs
U2CCA252979,OPTimIzing engageMent in discovery of molecular evolution of low grade glioma (OPTIMUM),"PROJECT SUMMARY Lower grade (World Health Organization (WHO) grade II/III) glioma (LGG), a malignant tumor of the brain, is a uniformly fatal disease of young adults. The optimal clinical management for LGG remains unknown. A comprehensive genomic characterization of the evolution from primary LGG to recurrence is required to begin to address the LGG knowledge gap; optimizing the engagement of LGG patients in this effort is critical to the success of this process. Using our International Low Grade Glioma Registry as a starting point, we will construct a community of 700 LGG patients who have undergone surgical resection at time of diagnosis and at time of recurrence and want to participate in research. We will use both hospital-based as well as web- and social media-based patient engagement efforts and adapt pre-existing resources developed at Yale including HUGO PHR, a secure cloud-based personal health record platform that allows secure and permission-based movement of data bi-directionally between patients and researchers and ARCHETYP, a Yale-developed software that assists patients in the location of clinical trials. We hypothesize that LGG patient engagement and satisfaction (and thus overall participation) in genomic characterization studies will be improved by 1) the ability to obtain and share medical record data with researchers, 2) the availability of bi-directional communication between study and patients regarding study focus, progress, outcomes as well as patient specific results, 3) improved messaging and education regarding study and patient goals with respect to genomic characterization of patient materials. We also propose that the knowledge gained in this application will provide a significant improvement in the care of LGG patients.",2021-09-21T12:09:00Z,2026-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-19-045,nofo_CA19-045,YALE UNIVERSITY,NEW HAVEN,CT,UNITED STATES,pe_cgs
U2CCA252981,Washington University Participant Engagement and Cancer Genomic Sequencing Center (WU-PE-CGS),"PROJECT SUMMARY Vision. Participant engagement and sequencing research from the Washington University Participant Engagement and Cancer Genomic Sequencing Center (WU-PE-CGS) will fill critical gaps in knowledge, methodology, and characterization of understudied cancer populations, leading to optimal approaches to participant engagement, outreach, and communication in genomic characterization studies. Goal. The overall goal of the WU-PE-CGS is to build a rigorous, scientific evidence base for approaches direct engagement of cancer patients and post-treatment cancer survivors as participants in cancer research. Our focus is on rare and understudied cancer populations with significant disparities including cholangiocarcinoma, multiple myeloma, and colorectal cancer under age 50. Participant engagement strategies are most effective when they are adapted and implemented in real-world settings in partnership with community and patient advocacy stakeholders. Setting. Our Center will be housed in an exceptional environment that fosters transdisciplinary collaboration, catalyzes new ideas in patient engagement, and ensures support for patient engagement and genome sequencing that finds solutions for complex recruitment and engagement challenges in real-world settings with underrepresented patient populations. Significant matching contributions from Washington University will allow us to quickly and strategically invest in ideas. Aims. The specific aims of the Center are to: (1) Advance the field of participant engagement to study cancer disparities and rare cancers by conducting innovative and impactful direct stakeholder engagement with continuous evaluation and research; (2) Expand an exceptional, diverse team of investigators, patients, and advocacy stakeholders; (3) Address cancer disparities by understanding barriers to and improving the ability for disadvantaged and understudied populations to encounter, use, and benefit from genomic sequencing and analysis; (4) Organize and integrate Center units to facilitate transdisciplinary, team science within our Center and across the PE-CGS Network. Innovations and impact. The WU-PE-CGS builds on a long and outstanding record of leadership in both cancer disparities and genomic research across the cancer continuum. We will be particularly innovative and allow for a significant return on the scientific investment in several ways. First, our Center has distinctive features that include a combined focus on cancer disparities, the application of strategies to increase participant engagement in research, success in biospecimen acquisition, and exceptional genomic sequencing expertise.

U2CCA271854,Michigan-VUMC Biomarker Characterization Center,"Project Summary/Abstract This application proposes the formation of the Michigan-Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) EDRN Biomarker Characterization Center (BCC). This BCC represents a collaborative, multi-disciplinary team of academic (University of Michigan (U-M) and VUMC) and industry (LynxDx) partners focused on discovering, developing, and scaling clinical-grade assays for the early detection of aggressive prostate cancer. Through previous EDRN efforts, our team characterized multiple important prostate cancer biomarkers, most notably the TMPRSS2-ETS gene fusions. Through collaboration with an EDRN Clinical Validation Center (CVC; Dr. Sanda PI), we developed, validated, and clinically implemented MyProstateScore (MPS), an early detection test incorporating urine quantification of two prostate cancer-specific transcripts—the TMPRSS2:ERG gene fusion and the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) PCA3. Introduced in our CLIA laboratory, MPS informs shared decision making after PSA testing based on individualized risk predictions of aggressive prostate cancer on biopsy. Here, pairing the cancer-specific components of the MPS test with recent discovery of high-grade cancer-specific biomarkers, we outline the development, optimization, and clinical validation of the next generation of diagnostic tests – capable of reliably, selectively detecting potentially lethal cancers that stand to benefit from early curative treatment. Our Biomarker Developmental Laboratory (BDL) will employ the experimental platform, MPS-SEQ, for capture RNA-seq analysis of urine samples to detect aggressive prostate cancer transcripts, lncRNAs, circular RNAs, fusion transcripts, mutations, indels, and splice variants. Our Biomarker Reference Laboratory (BRL) will in parallel develop a clinical grade urine assay, MPS-50, for the multiplex QPCR analysis of up to 50 amplicons. While the first 50 amplicons of MPS-50 have already been nominated, future improvements of the assay content and platform will be informed by work carried out in our BDL. To fuel these studies, our BCC has identified urine biospecimen cohorts collected under rigorous standard operating procedures in compliance with PRoBE criteria including the Michigan Prostate SPORE, Emory University, the Center for Prostate Disease Research, University of Texas San Antonio Health, Eastern Virginia Medical School, and VUMC/Meharry Medical College. The overall Aims of this BCC serve to develop, assess, and optimize MPS-SEQ and MPS-50 for identifying high-grade prostate cancer in diverse at-risk populations. Our BRL will also focus on standardizing clinically-validated biomarker assays for consistent and reliable use in accordance with CLIA/CAP guidelines at the U-M Center for Translational Pathology in order to facilitate network consortium studies and at LynxDx in order to scale, commercialize, and obtain FDA approvals. As recognized by the EDRN, novel biomarkers specific for aggressive prostate cancer are urgently needed. Importantly, our mission and efforts extend beyond our BCC and prostate cancer, as we actively participate in the EDRN biomarker community and support continued collaborative efforts with other BCCs and CVCs to advance the overall EDRN mission.",2022-08-15T12:08:00Z,2027-07-31T12:07:00Z,RFA-CA-21-035,nofo_CA-21-035,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,ANN ARBOR,MI,UNITED STATES,edrn
U2CCA271871,Genome-wide methylation and proteomic analysis of uterine lavage and cervical swab for  early detection of ovarian cancer,"Project Summary/Abstract – Overall A three-decade research program developing, optimizing, and testing an annual blood-based test for the early detection of ovarian cancer in normal risk postmenopausal women failed to show a cancer-specific mortality reduction. The likely fundamental reason for the failure is the short window of opportunity provided by a blood-based signal. The proposed BCC will seek to identify an alternative biospecimen for the source of signal which has a much greater window of time for detection in early-stage disease so that an annual testing frequency will have a high likelihood of detecting ovarian cancer during its curable stages. Due to the direct connection of the uterus to the fallopian tube, where the cell of origin resides, a uterine lavage will likely contain the earliest biological signals of the presence of ovarian cancer. Identifying a minimal ovarian cancer signal amongst a much greater background of uterine epithelium cells and cellular material requires a very sensitive test. Our BCC will build on a recently developed innovative genome-wide methylation test and combine it with a sensitive antibody based proteomic test. Having optimized the combined test to detect a signal in uterine lavage, the BCC will determine its sensitivity in Pap smears. The BCC will optimize the combined test on training uterine lavage samples, validate the test on independent validation cohort of uterine lavage samples, and assess its performance in Pap smear samples. If the optimized test is sensitive in Pap smears, then the overall goal of a clinically acceptable and readily performed test (Pap smear) conducted at a feasible frequency of every 12 months will be a crucial step towards an annual test for the early detection of ovarian cancer in normal risk postmenopausal women, the population in which 80% of ovarian cancers occur. The long-term goal is an early detection program resulting in a significant reduction in ovarian cancer mortality. The intended use of the test developed by the BCC will be as a clinical decision-support tool for screening normal risk postmenopausal women for early detection of ovarian cancer. Such a test will fill an unmet health gap since there is currently no early detection test for ovarian cancer.",2022-09-01T12:09:00Z,2027-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-21-035,nofo_CA-21-035,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,BOSTON,MA,UNITED STATES,edrn
U2CCA271885,Optimizing Ultrasensitive DNA methylation detection for lung cancer and other malignancies,"This proposal for a Biomarker Characterization Center (BCC) for the Early Detection Research Network (EDRN) seeks to improve the management of lung cancer through detection of cancer- specific DNA methylation. This effort includes a Biomarker Development Laboratory (BDL) which will optimize the methylation detection methods, implementation of these methods for clinical use through a Biomarker Reference Laboratory (BRL) with a longstanding record of molecular testing in a clinical setting, and an Administrative Core facilitating the interactions between the BDL and BRL, and with other EDRN investigators and the NCI. Previous work by the applicants has demonstrated the potential of DNA methylation detection for cancer diagnostics, and they have developed extremely sensitive assays for the detection of hypermethylated DNA sequences and optimized the isolation and processing of circulating cell-free DNA from tumors for these novel assays. The approach has been used to detect circulating cancer-specific DNA methylation changes for the early diagnosis of lung cancer in patients with screen-detected pulmonary nodules. Although sensitivity and specificity of the assay are promising, additional improvements in the performance are required for implementation of this approach in the setting of cancer screening. In this BCC, detection of cancer-specific DNA methylation changes in the plasma will be further improved, and new approaches developed and implemented to address the challenges of ultrasensitive detection of DNA methylation in the blood. In addition, we will assess the potential of these methods to detect other common and lethal malignancies. Our bioinformatic analysis of DNA methylation from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) has identified novel highly frequent cancer-specific methylation events common to all cancers, including lung cancer, that will be developed into universal cancer detection assays. The use of TCGA data has also resulted in the identification of other methylation alterations that allow determination of the origin (organ site) of this cancer-specific signal. The combination of optimal sample processing, ultrasensitive methylation detection, developed with universal cancer and histology specific loci detection, will allow improved lung cancer early detection in the setting of CT screening and management of detection of other cancer-specific DNA methylation from blood.",2022-09-16T12:09:00Z,2027-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-21-035,nofo_CA-21-035,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,PITTSBURGH,PA,UNITED STATES,edrn
U2CCA271891,A multidisciplinary BCC for ovarian cancer early detection: translating discoveries to clinical use with a by-design approach,"Project Summary (Overall) High-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) is the most common histological subtype of epithelial ovarian cancer. The overarching goal of the proposed Biomarker Characterization Center (BCC) is to apply a by- design approach based on biology of HGSOC pathogenesis and unmet clinical needs to identify, verify and prioritize, and validate biomarkers, and to develop them into an in vitro diagnostic multivariate index assay (IVDMIA) with the intended use to capture HGSOC in high-risk women at the early stages including i) precursors, ii) confinement to the ovary/fallopian tube or iii) low-volume diseases in high-risk women (BRCA1/2 carriers). The biomarkers that we propose to discover and validate in this proposal are intended for early detection but not necessarily for screening in general population. The BCC’s capability in advanced data generation technologies, multiplexed target assay development, and bioinformatics/data science will serve as resources for the EDRN. Based on the success of our current EDRN projects, this BCC will continue our on- going biomarker development studies including the validation of candidate biomarkers that we have identified through the current BDL. We propose the following specific aims: 1. To optimize and use novel specimen collection and processing technologies, and an iterative and cumulative process that takes advantage of our newly gained knowledge of the biology in ovarian cancer pathogenesis. BDL 2. To optimize and apply innovative bioinformatics, data sciences, and AI/ML tools that incorporate existing knowledge and data to improve discovery of low frequency biomarkers that with their functionally shared pathways/networks could collectively deliver an improved sensitivity while retaining a high specificity. BDL 3. To further develop and optimize the process for efficient multiplex targeted assay development with respect to analytical performance, throughput, and specimen volume requirement for a broad spectrum of candidate biomarkers using a “fit for purpose” approach. BRL 4. To optimize and apply a by-design approach to translating discoveries into clinical tests. Its application had been critical in the development of two FDA cleared tests by JHU team members for the preoperative assessment of ovarian malignancy risk. BDL/BRL 5. To provide expertise and analytical and data science capabilities to the entire EDRN community. The multi-disciplinary team that we have assembled (molecular cancer biology, pathology, clinical chemistry, mass spectrometry, biostatistics, data science, bioengineering), the unique, novel yet biologically and statistically sound approaches, and our long-standing experience in biomarker research and translating discoveries to FDA cleared clinical tests all together ensure the success of this proposed BCC.",2022-08-01T12:08:00Z,2027-07-31T12:07:00Z,RFA-CA-21-035,nofo_CA-21-035,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,BALTIMORE,MD,UNITED STATES,edrn
U2CCA271894,Virginia-UCLA-Toronto Biomarker Characterization Center,"Project Summary The critical challenge in the clinical management of newly-diagnosed localized prostate cancer remains distinguishing indolent from aggressive and life-threatening cancers. Biomarkers are urgently needed to identify those patients who harbor aggressive disease and will derive benefit from definitive treatment. We therefore, propose to apply complimentary proteogenomic-based discovery approaches to identify and then validate molecular features in prostate proximal fluids and tumor tissues that will be utilized in accurate early detection of aggressive forms of prostate cancer and improve disease risk stratification. The intended use of these biomarkers will be the early identification of men at risk for grade progression and improved risk- stratification for them. We have three biomarker development laboratory aims: 1) Validate our existing urine-based biomarkers for grade progression in a ProBE-compliant study selected from our own cohorts and the EDRN GU upgrading study. 2) Develop and validate urine and tissue-based biomarkers for the risk-stratification of MRI “invisible” high-grade lesions. 3) Develop and validate biomarkers to sub-stratify risk associated with deleterious germline BRCA2 variants. Our biomarker reference laboratory will develop and validate targeted clinically robust assays for multi-protein biomarkers panels. We will also develop decision algorithms that are cross-referenced for statistical rigor and benchmarked for optimal clinical performance. In addition to these BCC activities, we will develop robust PRM-MS assays and statistically rigorous decision tools for other EDRN BCCs and CVCs. Taken together, our EDRN biomarker characterization center will be a core part of the the EDRN ecosystem. We will continue to actively participate in trans-Network activities, and to share patient cohorts, protocols, datasets and analysis approaches and expertise. We will supplement these activities by focusing on promoting the growth of new and diverse talent in biomarker development through fostering junior investigator involvement across the full spectrum of biomarker development.",2022-09-02T12:09:00Z,2027-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-21-035,nofo_CA-21-035,EASTERN VIRGINIA MEDICAL SCHOOL,NORFOLK,VA,UNITED STATES,edrn
U2CCA271898,The Boston University - UCLA Lung Cancer Biomarker Characterization Center,"ABSTRACT Screen and incidentally detected intermediate risk indeterminant pulmonary nodules (IPN) represent a clinical dilemma for which there is little consensus about appropriate follow up due to a lack of sensitive and specific approaches for the detection of lung cancer absent invasive tissue sampling, and concerns about costs and harms from invasive tissue sampling in this large clinical population. Minimally invasive approaches that could accurately reclassify individuals from the intermediate risk group (5-65% risk of malignancy) to either low (< 5%) or high (>65%) risk would reduce uncertainty and transform the diagnostic workup of intermediate risk IPN. Developing, evaluating, standardizing, and validating such minimally invasive biomarkers so that they are ready for clinical use is the goal of the proposed BU-UCLA Lung Cancer Biomarker Characterization Center (BCC). In previous EDRN-funded work we established lung-cancer associated gene expression patterns in nasal epithelium collected with a swab from the inferior turbinate as a lung cancer biomarker. A test based on this innovative approach to lung cancer detection is being launched for clinical use as a CLIA LDT by our long-time collaborator Veracyte, Inc., which is participating in this BCC. We will evaluate the nasal biomarker for lung cancer in the setting of intermediate risk IPN. To further improve the ability to clinically discriminate benign from malignant intermediate risk IPN, the BU-UCLA Lung Cancer Biomarker Discovery Lab embedded within the BCC will develop and test lung cancer detection approaches that incorporate detection of circulating tumor cells (CTC) using a CLIA LDT assay from our collaborator LungLife AI, Inc. as well as blood based immune biomarkers, advanced imaging biomarkers, and refined nasal gene expression biomarkers. We will additionally determine if longitudinal biomarker assessment improves lung cancer detection over cross-sectional measurements. Promising assays will be refined, standardized, and validated by the BU-UCLA Lung Cancer Biomarker Reference Lab embedded within the BCC to advance them toward clinical adoption. These studies are enabled by biospecimens and imaging data that are being prospectively collected from diverse populations of patients undergoing workup for intermediate risk IPN in several large-scale ongoing clinical studies including VA LPOP, DECAMP 1-Plus, and UCLA IDx; lung cancer research programs at UCLA and Lahey; and our EDRN collaborators at Nashville VA and Vanderbilt. The BU-UCLA Lung Cancer BCC Team has the required multi- disciplinary expertise in lung cancer, translational and clinical pulmonary medicine, biomarker discovery, clinical assay development, biostatistics, clinical epidemiology, pathology, imaging, artificial intelligence, biological sciences, bioinformatics, genomics, and complex scientific program management to accomplish these goals. An Administrative Core embedded within the BCC will ensure that the BCC delivers on its aim to substantially advance novel lung cancer biomarkers from discovery to clinical application and make significant contributions to the Early Detection Research Network.",2022-09-01T12:09:00Z,2027-07-31T12:07:00Z,RFA-CA-21-035,nofo_CA-21-035,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,BOSTON,MA,UNITED STATES,edrn
U2CCA271902,Biomarkers for optimizing risk prediction and early detection of cancers of the colon and esophagus,"Project Summary Gastrointestinal (GI) cancers are a major cause of mortality and morbidity in the U.S. and their treatment uses a substantial proportion of healthcare resources. Of the GI cancers, colorectal cancer (CRC) and esophageal cancer (EAC) account for a majority of the cancer related deaths, and both are preventable by screening and surveillance. The current screening tests are suboptimal and have variable success. A major goal of CRC screening tests is to identify advanced tubular and serrated adenomas, which are high-risk for becoming CRC, as well as early stage CRC. The risk for CRC is variable with some people being at high risk because of family histories of CRC, hereditary cancer syndromes, or a personal history of adenomas. High risk people are placed on aggressive colonoscopy based surveillance programs and low-risk people are placed on minimal surveillance programs. Unfortunately, our current system for identifying high and low CRC risk is suboptimal resulting in under and over surveillance and preventable interval CRCs. Better risk markers for CRC to are needed to prevent interval CRCs and improve the overall effectiveness of CRC screening. Analogous to CRC, EAC arises from a precancerous condition of the esophagus called Barretts esophagus (BE), which is a specialized intestinal metaplasia of the esophagus and the highest risk factor for EAC. It is present in 5% of the US population. BE progresses to EAC through successive histologic steps of low grade dysplasia (LGD), high grade dysplasia (HGD) and then EAC. Screening and surveillance for BE is recommended using serial upper endoscopy, which is controversial in its effectiveness for preventing deaths from EAC. This is in part because, as with CRC, BE patients have variable risk of EAC and are placed on high- risk and low-risk screening programs. However, the current system for assigning risk is not accurate and the current screening test is expensive. More cost effective and accurate EAC and HGD screening/surveillance assays and accurate BE risk biomarkers are needed. We propose to develop an EDRN BCC that is integrated into the EDRN consortium and, through collaborations within and outside the EDRN, will develop effective GI cancer screening biomarkers. We propose to identify, validate, and develop accurate CLIA compliant risk biomarkers for CRC and for EAC in order to prevent EAC and CRC missed under current screening protocols. Moreover, the accurate risk stratification of patients for CRC and EAC will reduce the financial impact of current CRC and EAC prevention programs. We also propose to identify and validate accurate CLIA compliant early detection markers for HGD and early stage EAC that can be used in an inexpensive, non-endoscopic surveillance test.",2022-08-05T12:08:00Z,2027-07-31T12:07:00Z,RFA-CA-21-035,nofo_CA-21-035,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER CENTER,Seattle,WA,UNITED STATES,edrn
U2CCA271903,High-throughput immunoproteomics for cancer biomarker discovery,"Project Summary/Abstract The goal of the ASU Biomarker Characterization Center is to improve ovarian and lung cancer screening through the development of biologically-relevant circulating immune biomarkers. The scientific approach of our Center is based on several fundamental principles. First, that altered cancer protein expression, structure, and post- translational modifications induce host autoantibodies to create circulating biomarkers. Second, that alterations in microbial antigen expression (such as respiratory pathogens) also induce immunity, often detected in benign rather than malignant disease. Third, that the protein modifications, as well as the immune response to these neoantigenic structures, are heterogeneous between people, and that serologic biomarkers may complement circulating protein biomarkers. We will take a systems immunology approach to discover three types of antibodies, anti-microbial antibodies, autoantibodies and anti-aberrant glycoprotein antibodies. Our proposal builds on our extensive experiences with cancer biomarker discovery and immunoproteomics technology development. Our previous results on autoantibody biomarkers have been confirmed in blinded phase 2 multicenter validation studies and led to a CLIA-certified commercial blood test. Our results have shown that multiplexed panels of autoantibodies are required for adequate predictive value. With prior EDRN support, we have developed a set of innovative immunoproteomics technologies, namely high-density nucleic acid programmable protein array (HD-NAPPA), contra-capture protein array (CCPA) and multiplexed in solution protein array (MISPA), that, together with the largest full-length human and microbial gene collection at our DNASU plasmid repository, enable us to study antibodies against the full human proteome, microbial proteomes and the human O-glycoproteome for antibody biomarker signatures in cancer. Our Meso Scale Diagnostics (MSD) team has fielded over 3,000 instruments worldwide, and over 700 commercially available biomarker assay kits. Our expertise at serologic assay development was selected by Operation Warp Speed to use the V-PLEX® serology panels as the basis of its standard binding assays for immunogenicity assessments in all funded Phase III clinical trials of COVID vaccines. We will use our MSD MultiArray platform to migrate the top serologic and protein markers for their utility in our target clinical applications. We will collaborate with experts on lung and ovarian cancer screening at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Boston University, MD Anderson Cancer Center, and German Cancer Research Center, who will also provide access to high-quality well-characterized samples to develop circulating biomarkers to enhance ovarian cancer screening or to distinguish benign from malignant pulmonary nodules. Adhering to the principles of PRoBE design, we will perform Phase I discovery by screening protein arrays with cancer patient and control sera for cancer or control-specific antibodies. Candidate biomarkers for both lung and ovarian cancers will undergo Phase 2 validation.",2022-09-01T12:09:00Z,2027-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-21-035,nofo_CA-21-035,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY-TEMPE CAMPUS,TEMPE,AZ,UNITED STATES,edrn

U54CA143727,(1/2) Pacific Island Partnership for Cancer Health Equity (PIPCHE),"PROJECT SUMMARY: OVERALL The Pacific Island Partnership for Cancer Health Equity (PIPCHE) is a 17-year collaboration between the University of Guam (UOG) and the University of Hawai‘i Cancer Center (UHCC) that continues to advance cancer health equity, increase the cancer research and education capacity, and decrease significant cancer disparities in Pacific Islands Populations. Americans of Pacific Islander ancestry are a highly underserved and vulnerable minority with a disparate cancer burden, including significant underrepresentation among cancer and biomedical researchers and healthcare providers, which further exacerbates the disparities. The overarching goal and long-term objective are to promote cancer health equity and mitigate the impact of cancer on Pacific Island Populations through increasing cancer research leadership and capacity in Hawai‘i, Guam and the United States Affiliated Pacific Islands, which comprise the Pacific Island Populations addressed by this project. As the only National Cancer Institute-funded Partnership serving the underrepresented Pacific Island region, PIPCHE will accomplish its goals through the following specific aims: (1) Continue to develop a diverse portfolio of Pacific Island Population-focused cancer research projects that include clinical, basic, and population health sciences, (2) Collaborate with local and regional Pacific Island community organizations that work with underrepresented Pacific Island Populations to promote cancer health equity and enhance opportunities for research training and workforce development, (3) Sustain, strengthen, and continuously evaluate of all the Partnership’s research, core activities, and research education programs, (4) Enhance and implement evidence-based, relevant, cancer-related public health interventions and cancer, prevention and control strategies with and within underrepresented communities, and (5) Expand the scientific collaboration among PIPCHE members and other faculty within the two institutions, with an emphasis on recruiting Early Stage Investigators of Pacific Island ancestry. PIPCHE will carry out these aims by continued investment in four Cores (Cancer Outreach, Research Education, Planning and Evaluation, and Administration), which provide the infrastructure and governance of the Partnership. The proposed Shared Resources (Biostatistics, Epidemiology, Information Technology, and Cancer Registry) will provide essential technical and scientific support to the PIPCHE student scholars, trainees, and the proposed full research projects and pilot projects that specifically address the cancer disparities of the Pacific Island Populations.

U54CA143924,2/2 Partnership for Native American Cancer Prevention,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRCT: OVERALL The Partnership for Native American Cancer Prevention (NACP) is uniquely positioned to address cancer health inequities in Native American communities. Cancer is the second leading cause of death for Native Americans over the age of 45 years. Despite improvements in cancer screening techniques and major developments in cancer treatment in past decades, tribal communities have not benefited equally from these advances. Further, the NIH recognizes that Native Americans have the lowest representation of all underrepresented groups in the biomedical research workforce, which contributes to the overall cancer health inequities for this population. NACP began in 2002 as a partnership between Northern Arizona University (NAU), as the institution serving underserved health disparity populations and underrepresented students, and the University of Arizona Cancer Center (UACC), as the Comprehensive Cancer Center. The overarching goals of NACP are to increase NAU's cancer research and UACC's cancer health disparities capacities by honoring existing and establishing new Native American community partnerships. To meet these goals, the following aims are proposed: Aim 1. Conduct Pilot Research Projects and Full Research Projects, which address Native American cancer disparities and reflect community concerns; Aim 2. Recruit and support Native American faculty focused on cancer research; Aim 3. Create a new shared resource called “Guiding U54 Investigator Development to Sustainability (GUIDeS)“ with the goal to facilitate the transition of NACP- affiliated, Early Stage Investigators/Junior Investigators to research independence; Aim 4. Expand and implement cancer disparities research education with a focus on Native American students across NAU/UA undergraduate and graduate programs; Aim 5. Integrate community engagement principles into all NACP activities, facilitating dissemination of the Partnership's research findings and the National Outreach Network's initiatives to Native American communities. To achieve these Aims, two Full and one Pilot project are proposed; two have Native American co-leaders. One of the Full projects and the Pilot project combine basic science and community engaged research to address gastric and cervical cancer; death rates for these cancers are higher in Native American populations. We propose Administrative, Planning and Evaluation, Research Education, Outreach and GUIDeS Cores to support the research projects and integrate activities across the Partnership. NAU and UACC commit institutional funds to support new projects and Native American investigators. New priorities in this proposal are community engaged research that will impact cancer screening rates, recruitment and mentoring of Native American early stage investigators, grant writing activities to sustain Native American-focused cancer disparities research and initiatives, and joint research education curricula to develop a stronger Native American biomedical workforce.

The group has added additional collaborative sites at MIT, the Dana Farber Cancer Institute and Munich Technical University, and will utilize heavily a new Microbiome and Metabolomics Core at Penn- CHOP. Thus, the team comprises broad and unique expertise in mouse models, genomics, microbiology and clinical research. The application is built around the hypothesis that the inflammation-dependent tumor microenvironment, modulated by the GE junction microbiome, is critical for early progression of esophageal carcinogenesis. The proposal will utilize both the novel transgenic (L2-IL-1β) and innovative 3D organoid models, along with a cross-sectional study of 100 BE patients. Project 1 will study the role of microbiota and myeloid cells in the L2-IL-1β mouse model of Barrett’s esophagus. This project will incorporate germ-free housing, antibiotic eradication, colonization with defined flora, myeloid cell ablation and correlative human studies. Project 2 is focused on the characterization of microenvironment drivers in BE, and will include FACS/IHC analysis of CAFs and immune cells (MDSCs/Tregs) in BE patients, along with 3D organoids in culture. The role of IL-6 in response to epithelial TP53 mutations and immune cell activation will be defined. Finally, Project 3 will seek to identify novel biomarkers and gene signatures related to the microbiome and microenvironment. The study will analyze bile acids, a product of microbes, and minimally invasive tests such as saliva/breath test/tethered capsule sponge to analyze microbes to develop screening/surveillance strategies. Overall, these projects will advance the science of the microbiome and microenvironment in BE that will hopefully lead to translational applications.",2011-09-26T12:09:00Z,2023-10-31T12:10:00Z,RFA-CA-10-014;RFA-CA-16-006,nofo_RFA-CA-16-006,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,NEW YORK,NY,UNITED STATES,betrnet
U54CA163059,Early Targets in Progression of Barrett's Esophagus to Esophageal Adenocarcinoma,"- Project Summary/Abstract Recently, the incidence of esophageal (EAC) and gastro-esophageal junction (GEJAC) adenocarcinoma has increased dramatically, and have a poor 5-year survival rate of less than 15%. When detected early, these patients can have a good clinical outcome following surgery. These observations underscore the importance of early cancer detection. Patients with Barrett's esophagus (BE) are known to be at increased risk. Our overarching goal is to advance new methods of imaging to visualize the effects of spatial distribution of genetic alterations in BE by using novel imaging methods to evaluate tumor heterogeneity on the progression toward EAC. We propose a multi-institutional, trans-disciplinary, translational Research Center in the Barrett's Esophagus Translational Research Network (BETRNet). Our mission is to build on our expertise in genomic characterization, peptide biochemistry, and clinical translation to achieve our ultimate goal to perform early cancer detection at an early stage where therapeutic intervention can be most effective. We will identify a complementary panel of genes that are overexpressed on the cell surface and will be used to develop and validate new peptide imaging agents. The targets chosen will address 3 important clinical needs: 1) Real-time endoscopic identification of pre-malignant lesions and early stage cancer to guide endoscopic resection; 2) Risk stratification of BE patients for timing of endoscopic surveillance; and 3) Detection of gastro- esophageal junction adenocarcinomas in patients without endoscopic appearance of BE. We will use state-of-the-art genomic tools to to identify early overexpressed gene targets that arise in progression of BE to EAC by providing comprehensive analyses of gene expression alterations, DNA copy number variation, and genetic mutations. We will select candidate genes that are expressed on the cell surface where they can be endoscopically imaged in vivo. We will rigorously validate the panel of candidate targets with quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays using an independent cohort of human esophagus specimens. We will use these targets to first identify and validate monomer peptides that are highly specific. We will then arrange monomer peptides in a dimer configuration to produce multivalent ligand target interactions to improve binding performance and allow for early targets to be detected at low levels of expression. We will use a flexible fiber multi-spectral endoscope that can pass through the working channel of a standard medical endoscope to detect multiple targets at the same time. Successful completion of these aims will provide an integrated multi-spectral imaging methodology to longitudinally visualize overexpressed molecular targets that drive progression of Barrett's esophagus to esophageal adenocarcinoma. This innovative approach can serve as the foundation for validated preventive measures to improve patient management.",2011-09-21T12:09:00Z,2024-04-30T12:04:00Z,RFA-CA-10-014;RFA-CA-16-006,nofo_RFA-CA-16-006,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,ANN ARBOR,MI,UNITED STATES,betrnet

U54CA209891,Research Center for Cancer Systems Biology: Cancer Cell Map Initiative,"THE CANCER CELL MAP INITIATIVE: A NATIONAL RESEARCH CENTER FOR CANCER SYSTEMS BIOLOGY OVERALL SUMMARY The Cancer Genome Atlas and sister projects have now completed analysis of over 10,000 tumor genomes, providing a catalog of the gene mutations, copy number variants and other genetic alterations that cause cancer. In many cases it remains unclear, however, which are the key driver mutations or dependencies in a given cancer and how these influence pathogenesis and response to therapy. Although tumors of similar types and clinical outcomes can have patterns of mutations that are strikingly different, it is becoming apparent that these mutations recurrently hijack the same hallmark molecular pathways and networks. For this reason, cancer research and treatment is increasingly dependent on knowledge of biological networks of multiple types, including physical interactions among proteins and syntheticlethal and epistatic interactions among genes. Here we seek support for a new effort, The Cancer Cell Map Initiative (CCMI), aimed at comprehensively detailing these complex interactions among cancer genes and proteins and how they differ between diseased and healthy states. The CCMI is a multicampus initiative of the University of California, centered at UC San Francisco and UC San Diego, which leverages advanced network mapping, computational analysis and cancer research platforms developed by multiple CCMI investigators over the past decade. Thus primed, these platforms will be turned to efficiently generate, assemble and analyze cancer molecular networks with a view towards pathway and networkbased personalized therapy. Specifically, over the next five years the CCMI will seek to catalyze major phase transitions in cancer research and therapy by (1) Comprehensively mapping the networks of physical interactions among cancer proteins, revealing the protein complexes and higherorder molecular units under selection in cancer; (2) Mapping the parallel networks of syntheticlethal and epistatic interactions among cancer genes, revealing the functional logic of cancer; (3) Establishing the robust computational methodology, enduser software, and databases for assembly and use of cancer cell network maps in both basic and clinical modalities; (4) Building a critical mass of leading cancer investigators worldwide to expand CCMI into a global coordinated partnership; and (5) Training the current and nextgeneration of scientists in Network Biology and its applications to cancer research.",2017-05-11T12:05:00Z,2022-04-30T12:04:00Z,RFA-CA-15-014,nofo_RFA-CA-15-014,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",SAN FRANCISCO,CA,UNITED STATES,csbc
U54CA209971,Modeling the Role of Lymph Node Metastases in Tumor-Mediated Immunosuppression,"ABSTRACT/SUMMARY – Overall Distant metastasis is the primary cause of cancer-related death. To colonize distant tissues, cancer cells must migrate while evading elimination by the immune system. Evidence suggests that key steps in the induction process of immune tolerance occur early in the metastatic cascade, located at regional lymph nodes. However, the nature of the interactions between tumors and immune cells remains poorly understood, particularly for those occurring within the lymph nodes. Even though lymph nodes are in fact commonly assessed in cancer patients to determine disease stage and treatment plan, they are understudied in the context of metastatic progression. To fill this scientific knowledge gap, we propose a Research Center focused on the role of lymph node metastases in tumor-mediated immunosuppression. We hypothesize that lymph node metastasis constitutes an essential, first step in the metastatic cascade of cancer progression. Based on our preliminary findings, we speculate that such metastases act locally upon the adaptive immune system within the nodes to begin to induce systemic tolerance of the tumor. We will explore, compare and test this hypothesis in two malignancies: (i) melanoma and (ii) head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. We have assembled a multidisciplinary team whose coordinated efforts will involve the application of genomic and single-cell in-situ imaging technologies on preclinical and human samples to explore the evidence and mechanisms of the induction of immunosuppression in the lymph nodes. We propose three inter-connected Research Projects that focus our scientific theme on different platforms: murine models (Project 1), high-dimensional in-situ imaging (Project 2), and integrative computational analysis (Project 3). All three projects will utilize a shared resource core dedicated to the acquisition of patient samples and associated clinical annotation and data management (Biospecimen and Data Management Core. These efforts will yield highly multiplexed, multi-scale datasets which will be analyzed by novel bio-computational methods to reconstruct intracellular and intercellular molecular interaction networks in order to identify, then functionally validate, critical mediators of tumor immunosuppression. Our ultimate objective is to advance our understanding of the systemic consequences of lymph node metastases and identify new therapeutic approaches to cancer immunotherapy.

U54CA209975,The CSBC Research Center for Cancer Systems Immunology at MSKCC,"SUMMARY Exciting clinical breakthroughs with checkpoint blockade antibodies and adoptive T cell transfers have transformed the field of cancer immunotherapy, demonstrating the power of harnessing the immune system to eliminate cancer cells. However, fundamental challenges and questions remain. Significant clinical responses have only been observed in a subset of patients and cancer types, and it is currently not known what biological properties of tumors determine clinical responses, nor what strategies to adopt in clinical contexts where current immunotherapies are ineffective. To ultimately address these clinical challenges and to design predictably effective cancer treatments, we must deepen our fundamental understanding of interactions between tumors and the immune system at the molecular, cellular, and systems levels. The CSBC Research Center for Cancer Systems Immunology at MSKCC will bring the tools of systems biology to investigate cancer-immune system interactions at multiple stages of disease progression to answer central questions in cancer immunology and inform the design of novel immunotherapeutic interventions. We have organized our Research Center around three central scientific projects that examine cancer-immune interactions at distinct stages of disease progression: cancer initiation and early tumorigenesis (Project I); established and progressing tumors (Project II); latent disease and metastasis in (Project III). In Project I, we will combine new epigenomics technologies and innovative single-cell analyses with state-of-the-art systems biology approaches to decipher the underlying molecular and epigenetic programs of dysfunctional tumor- specific T cell differentiation in early tumorigenesis. We will further elucidate how dynamics in the mutational tumor antigen landscape and stromal and immune cell populations determine such states and model and test in mouse and human tumors how distinct T cell states determine sensitivity to immune checkpoint blockade. In Project II, we will use quantitative analysis of cell types and cell states by functional, flow cytometric, population RNA-seq and droplet RNA sequencing together with ecological models of cancer, immune, and stromal cell populations to study the response of the tumor ecosystem to immunotherapeutic perturbations in established tumors. In Project III, we will examine the evolutionary dynamics of innate immune system control of metastatic disease, a new area of investigation in cancer immunology. We will investigate the heterogeneity of latent cancer cells in their capacity for immune evasion, and we will use quantitative methods, including live cell imaging, to model latent tumor cell evasion of innate immune control and the dynamics of cycles of latent cell proliferation and potential editing by NK cells. A Shared Resource Core will provide state-of-the-art single-cell droplet sequencing technology and computational analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data (scRNA- seq). This Shared Resource Core will be tasked with droplet sequencing technology development and design of novel algorithmic approaches and will interact with all three scientific Projects. Our Research Center will also carry out an innovative program of outreach and training activities at the local, national, and global levels to disseminate research findings in cancer systems immunology and to train young scientists in this emerging field.",2016-08-26T12:08:00Z,2022-07-31T12:07:00Z,RFA-CA-15-014,nofo_RFA-CA-15-014,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,NEW YORK,NY,UNITED STATES,csbc
U54CA209978,Combating Subclonal Evolution of Resistant Cancer Phenotypes,"Overall abstract Our Cancer Systems Biology Center of HoPE (Heterogeneity of Phenotypic Evolution) will develop a suite of systems-based methodologies to understand how genomic diversity, clonal evolution, and phenotypic change . To evaluate their potential for translation, we will integrate these dynamic models with clinical trials that will evaluate whether these phenotypic changes can be targeted for therapy. We hypothesize that acquired resistance emerges from selection acting on phenotypes during tumor evolution, and that simultaneously measuring and modeling subclone genotypes and phenotypes will identify new, and testable, therapeutic targets. Selective pressures from therapy and the tumor microenvironment can propel subclones from every patient's tumor along an evolutionary trajectory that leads to resistance. Indeed, our data shows that both genetic and phenotypic diversity among tumor subclones evolves as cancer cells progress to a resistant state. However, it is not yet known the specific phenotypes that promote that resistant state, the interactions among them, and how they converge to common resistant phenotypes seen in late stage cancer. To address these and other questions, we will develop a new class of dynamical systems models of subclone evolution to characterize the changes and development of key cell states that arise during acquired chemo-resistance and metastasis using our unique patient cohorts. These mechanistic models will identify points of therapeutic vulnerability that we will test in clinical trials aimed at blocking evolution to a resistant state by targeting critical resistant phenotypes. Our Center is comprised of an Administrative, Education/Outreach, Translational, and Computational Cores, in addition to two complementary projects. The synergies are derived from: 1) the convergent parameterization of the evolutionary models drawn from deep longitudinal patient progression studies (Project 1) and broad multisite metastatic tumor analyses (Project 2), resulting in a robust model to identify resistant states for clinical targeting; and 2) an integrated computational and experimental framework and resources for dissecting tumor heterogeneity and evolution that will contribute to an improved capacity for personalized cancer therapy. Our multidisciplinary team of systems biologists, bioinformaticians, tumor biologists, pharmacologists, mathematical biologists, and clinicians will tackle these scientific challenges. We will create programs to educate the next generation of scientists in systems biology and inform the community about the latest scientific advances and their impact on treatment strategies. And we will provide state of the art tools for the analysis of patient samples and tumor genomic complexity. These studies move beyond prior research by integrating cell population dynamics and cellular phenotypes with cellular genotypes, and will deliver approaches and a knowledge base to block or reverse the transition to a resistant state for advanced stage cancer patients. interact in the progression toward chemoresistant breast and ovarian cancer",2017-05-15T12:05:00Z,2023-06-30T12:06:00Z,RFA-CA-15-014,nofo_RFA-CA-15-014,BECKMAN RESEARCH INSTITUTE/CITY OF HOPE,DUARTE,CA,UNITED STATES,csbc
U54CA209988,"Measuring, Modeling and Controlling Heterogeneity","ABSTRACT - Overall The overall goal of the Measuring, Modeling and Controlling Heterogeneity Center in the Cancer Systems Biol- ogy Consortium (M2CH-CSBC Center) is to improve management of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) by developing systems level strategies to prevent the emergence of cancer subpopulations that are resistant to treatment. We postulate that heterogeneity arising from epigenomic instability intrinsic to cancer cells and di- verse signals from extrinsic microenvironments in which cancer cells reside are root causes of resistance. We will learn how intrinsic and extrinsic factors influence differentiation state, proliferation and therapeutic re- sponse in TNBC through experimental manipulation and computational modeling of cancer cell lines, 3D engi- neered multicellular systems, xenografts and clinical specimens. We will deploy single cell `omic and imaging technologies that allow quantitative assessment of molecular, cellular, and structural heterogeneity. We will interpret these data using computational models that define control networks and structures in heterogeneous systems as well as transitions between states of therapeutic resistance and sensitivity. This will be accom- plished in three related Projects and three Cores. Project 1 will focus on measuring and managing resistance- associated heterogeneity intrinsic to cancer cells. Project 2 will focus on identifying resistance-associated sig- nals from the microenvironment and on mitigating effects from these signals on therapeutic response. Project 3 will apply spatial systems biology approaches to TNBC specimens and multicell type models thereof to dis- cover molecular control networks that influence how cell intrinsic plasticity and microenvironment signaling al- ter therapeutic responses in complex tissues. All three Projects will include analysis of 5 core cell lines (HCC1143, HCC1599, MDA-MB-468, SUM149PT, and HCC1806), 5 patient derived cultures, and 6 FDA ap- proved, pathway-targeted drugs (afatinib, ruxolotinib, trametinib, BYL719, cabozantinib, and everolimus). The computational network discovery, data integration, spatial systems analysis and modeling approaches are the same in all Projects and serve to integrate the work of the overall M2CH-CSBC Center. Multiple integrative computational strategies are proposed to identify candidate heterogeneity control networks. These include analysis of existing genomic, epigenomic, pharmacologic response, and metabolomic characteristics of prima- ry tumors and models thereof. An Imaging Management and Analysis Core will provide infrastructure and image analytics that will enable efficient image data management, quantitative analysis of image features, and visualization of images and metadata generated using multiscale light and electron microscopy. An Outreach Core will make educational materials, experimental and computational tools and data available to the CSB Consortium, to the CSBC/PS-ON Coordinating Center and to the broader scientific community.

U54CA209992,Systems analysis of phenotypic switch in control of cancer invasion,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Overall Over 90% of cancer related mortality is linked to invasive and metastatic spread of cancer cells from the primary tumor. This spread can be catastrophically fast in the cases of particularly aggressive, high grade melanomas and gliomas (i.e., glioblastoma multiforme (GBM)), leading to uniformly poor prognosis and short life expectancy in these cancers. In spite of the crucial importance of invasive cancer phenotype, we still have only fragmentary knowledge and understanding of the mechanisms leading to transition from proliferative to aggressive, migratory behavior of cancer cells (referred here as the P-A phenotypic switch). Increasing evidence suggests that this switch is a reflection of inherent capacity of cancer cells to adopt both proliferative and migrator phenotypes, with the probability and rate of switching between these two phenotypes controlled by the cell genome, environmental conditions and cell-cell interactions. To address the problem of regulation of invasive cancer spread and, more specifically the P-A phenotypic switch, we propose to establish the Yale Cancer Systems Biology Center (Y-CSBC). The Center will based on the existing organization and infrastructure of the recently founded Yale Systems Biology Institute (YSBI) on the Yale West Campus, leveraging the extensive existing shared resources and juxtaposition of the labs within the same recently renovated, state of the art research space. The Center will bring together researchers from 7 Yale departments based at Yale schools of Arts and Science, Engineering and Applied Science and Medicine and Emory University, in close collaboration with Yale Cancer Institute (physically adjacent to YSBI), Yale Cancer Center, Yale skin cancer SPORE, and Yale Neurosurgery department. The work at the proposed Center will be initially based on the Proposed tightly knit two Research Projects and two support shared resource Cores, initially focused on the analysis of glioblastoma and melanoma cells, and normal cells of various species modeling invasive growth behavior and phenotypic switching. With time, the emphasis on these two cancers may broaden with new members expanding the scope and the aims. The proposed research already reflects the diversity and innovative nature of the work pursued by the participating labs within YSBI and collaborative labs, with the combination of techniques and approaches as diverse as synthetic biology, nano-scale bioengineering, evolutionary biology, high throughput genomics, mathematical modeling, novel animal models, all combined into a integrated research program. The work will be supported by the Administrative Core and the results disseminated through various mechanisms mediated by the Outreach and Education Core. The orthogonal and unconventional approaches proposed in the application and characteristic of the highly collaborative use of cutting edge, innovative approaches, many of which are being pioneered here, will provide an opportunity to advance our understanding of the molecular networks controlling invasive, aggressive cancer spread and lead to new approaches to controlling and treating highly invasive and metastatic malignancies.",2016-08-08T12:08:00Z,2022-07-31T12:07:00Z,RFA-CA-15-014,nofo_RFA-CA-15-014,YALE UNIVERSITY,NEW HAVEN,CT,UNITED STATES,csbc
U54CA209997,Centers for Cancer Systems Therapeutics (CaST),"PROJECT SUMMARY The quantitative, model driven approaches that constitute the underpinning of systems biology are emerging as an increasingly critical methodological repertoire for a truly “precise” implementation of precision cancer medicine. This is especially relevant in view of the increasing limitations of current approaches based on the oncogene addiction paradigm. Even though pharmacological inhibition of oncogenes harboring activating alterations has emerged as a valuable rationale for targeted therapy, >75% of all adult malignancies lack any actionable alteration or present with undruggable ones and inhibitors of canonical oncogenes have shown lackluster response in the clinic. Most critically, following initial and at times remarkable response, targeted therapy almost invariably leads to relapse to drug-resistant disease. Systematic treatment of hundreds of cell lines with hundreds of compounds has shown that, with few notable exceptions, mutations are far from representing optimal predictors of targeted agent sensitivity. This is not surprising, as drug sensitivity clearly represents a complex polygenic phenotype, requiring equally complex and tumor-specific models. This center proposal encompasses studies across multiple levels of granularity, representing the full complexity of the tumor phenotype: from tumor/microenvironment interactions to single cell plasticity, supporting tumors reprograming to distinct isogenic states associated with progression or drug resistance. Specifically, three complementary directions will be pursued: First, elucidation of the regulatory module architecture (tumor checkpoint) and specific proteins within these modules (master regulators) that comprise the dysregulated mechanisms presiding over tumor homeostasis (I.e., a cell's ability to maintain its tumor state independent of mutational landscape and endogenous/exogenous signal heterogeneity). This will be accomplished by developing model-based approaches to analyze omics data representing distinct compartments of the tumor, ranging from tumor bulk, to stroma/tumor compartments, to single cells, following physiologic, genetic, and pharmacologic perturbations. Second, study the mechanisms by which tumor state can be altered to induce progression or drug resistance by adopting and extending approaches for the study of physiologic differentiation and reprograming. This analysis will integrate subclonal genomic characterization, using innovative computational models, with single cell data from primary tumors and patient derived xenografts to elucidate the mechanisms presiding over tumor plasticity. Finally, using the mechanistic regulatory frameworks emerging from these studies to elucidate actionable tumor dependencies leading to irreversible collapse of tumor homeostasis in vitro and in vivo. This will be accomplished by assembling and experimentally validating both probabilistic and kinetic models of tumor checkpoint regulation, assembled from time-series data following systematic small molecule perturbations. Center-developed software and methods will be disseminated to the Research Community, using proven strategies.",2016-08-08T12:08:00Z,2022-07-31T12:07:00Z,RFA-CA-15-014,nofo_RFA-CA-15-014,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,NEW YORK,NY,UNITED STATES,csbc
U54CA217297,Systems Analysis of Epigenomic Architecture in Cancer Progression,"ABSTRACT/SUMMARY – Overall Systems Analysis of Epigenomic Architecture in Cancer Progression Despite anti-hormone therapies in patients, the cognate receptors ER and AR can remain functional to support oncogenic signaling for advanced progression of breast and prostate cancers. Intensive studies have uncovered cellular and biochemical changes underlying the development of hormone resistance. However, epigenetic mechanisms for establishing and maintaining a hormone-resistant phenotype remain to be explored. Our preliminary studies have found remarkably similar epigenetic machineries that regulate hormone-independent gene transcription in both breast and prostate cancers. This process has multifaceted components, involving trans- and cis-acting elements, nucleosome reorganization, and chromatin interactions. To understand this complex mechanism, the San Antonio-Ohio State University Research Center for Cancer Systems Biology (SA-OSU RCCSB) has assembled a team of 21 experimental and computational investigators, and oncologists who will study a three-tiered epigenetic framework for gene regulation. First, microenvironmental cues initiate the recruitment of a specific combination of trans-bound transcription factors (TFs), called MegaTrans TFs, to ER or AR-bound enhancers (Project 1). MegaTrans TFs are composed of diverse signaling-dependent transcription factors that activate these enhancers through receiving other signal cues without hormone stimulation. Second, this hormone-independent action requires well-orchestrated repositioning of nucleosomes, enabling maximal MegaTrans-DNA contact in target chromatin regions (Project 2). Pioneer factor FOXA1 and chromatin remodelers are also critical regulators of repositioned nucleosomes during the transition of a hormone-sensitive to -resistant phenotype. Third, this concerted action triggers chromatin movement, remotely bringing the MegaTrans/enhancer complexes in close proximity to target promoters (Project 3). Intra- and inter-chromatin interactions facilitate the formation of transcriptional architectures that efficiently and autonomously regulate ER/AR-mediated gene expression even in the absence of agonists or in the presence of antagonists. Experimental investigators will use omics-seq platforms to map combinatorial MegaTrans complexes, repositioned nucleosomes, and topologically associated domains (TADs) that spatiotemporally regulate hormone-independent transcription. Computational scientists will then use omics data to derive 3D models of DNA-eRNA-protein interacting units in subnuclear compartments of cancer cells. Back to the bench, experimental scientists will use in silico findings to validate enhancer/gene markers that predict a hormone-resistant phenotype in patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) and clinical samples. To ensure seamless data integration of the three proposed projects, a Data Analysis and Management Core will implement customized toolkits to manage computational infrastructure and store omics-seq metadata for heuristic queries by community systems biologists. An Outreach Core will facilitate training of new-generation systems biologists and enhance collaborative efforts within the NCI's consortium and in the 4D nucleome community. An Administrative Core will provide governance and oversee rigorous evaluations of Intra-center Pilot Projects (IPPs), ensure cross-pollination between bench and in silico scientists in the SA-OSU RCCSB, and reinforce national guidelines of data sharing.",2017-05-15T12:05:00Z,2023-04-30T12:04:00Z,RFA-CA-15-014,nofo_RFA-CA-15-014,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCIENCE CENTER,SAN ANTONIO,TX,UNITED STATES,csbc
U54CA217376,Arizona Cancer and Evolution Center (ACE),"Overall Project Summary/Abstract Cancer is an evolutionary and ecological phenomenon driven by the fundamental forces of evolution: mutations, natural selection and genetic drift. It provides a classic example of multi-level selection. At the level of individual cancer cells, selection favors neoplastic proliferation; at the level of the host organism, selection favors cancer suppression. A full understanding of cancer hinges on an appreciation of this fundamental tension. Regulatory mechanisms at the organismal level determine evolutionary parameters at the cell level such as the somatic mutation rate and response to DNA damage. Cancer circumvents those constraints and changes the parameters of cell-level evolution, leading to malignancy and eventual host death. Thus, organismal and cell-level evolution feedback upon each other. To paraphrase Dobzhansky, nothing in cancer biology makes sense except in the light of evolution. This opens an opportunity. We may apply evolutionary and ecological theory to neoplastic progression and response to therapy. The mission of the Arizona Cancer and Evolution Center (ACE) is to advance our fundamental understanding of cancer and its clinical management through the development and application of evolutionary and ecological models to cancer biology. This mission spans scales from the evolution of cancer suppression mechanisms and cancer susceptibility across species (Project 1) down to the evolution of normal somatic cells (Project 2) and populations of cancer cells (Project 3). Project 1 will develop models of organismal evolution to predict cancer rates and cancer defenses across species. We will test those predictions using veterinary databases of cancer incidence in over 1,900 animal species, and examine the genomes of 57 mammalian species for evidence of adaptations to the selective pressure of cancer. In addition, Project 2 will test Project 1's model predictions of cancer defenses in primary cells from those same 57 mammalian species. Project 2 will also measure the fundamental forces of evolution in normal colonic and small intestine tissue from humans, mice and elephants to address a basic but poorly understood property of cancer: tissue-level differences in cancer susceptibility. Project 3 will develop novel evolutionary and ecological indices, based on models of cell-level evolution in neoplasms from Project 1, to predict long term therapeutic response and patient survival in stage 2&3, chemo- naïve colorectal cancers. These indices will provide, for the first time, a classification system that the community can use to draw distinctions between tumors with different evolutionary dynamics, and thereby provide a foundation for the clinical management of this evolving disease. ACE will support the Cancer Systems Biology Consortium and the growing field of evolution and cancer by providing data, analytical tools, models, workshops, and tutorials to facilitate the use of those resources.",2018-04-12T12:04:00Z,2024-03-31T12:03:00Z,RFA-CA-15-014,nofo_RFA-CA-15-014,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY-TEMPE CAMPUS,TEMPE,AZ,UNITED STATES,csbc
U54CA217377,Quantitative and functional characterization of therapeutic resistance in cancer,"Overall – Project Summary Despite tremendous advances in our understanding of cancer pathogenesis, the treatment of individual patients with either conventional chemotherapy or targeted agents remains highly empiric. Current efforts to predict drug efficacy are generally focused on genetic and transcriptional markers of pathway activation or drug binding, such as resistance mutations that sterically hinder small molecule binding or activate parallel or orthogonal signaling pathways. These markers exist in a very small fraction of all cancers, such that most patients are treated with little or no understanding of whether they will respond to an individual therapy. This results in many patients receiving ineffective and/or unnecessarily toxic therapies. There is a desperate need to change this paradigm. The ideal for characterizing therapeutic sensitivity would allow for: real-time decision making, identification of rare subpopulations with therapeutic resistance, analysis of very small samples (e.g. MRD), and maintains viability individual cells for downstream assays to characterize phenotypic, genotypic, transcriptional and other determinants of sensitivity. The overall goal of our U54 application is to address this need using new strategies for predicting therapeutic response in which paired phenotypic and genomic properties are measured at the single-cell level. Phenotypic properties will include both physical parameters (e.g. mass, mass accumulation rate) and molecular markers (e.g. protein secretion, surface immunophenotype) that are rapidly affected by effective therapeutics and precede longer- term phenotypes (e.g. loss of viability). Because these properties are measured for each single cell, clonal architectures based on therapeutic response will be established across each tumor sample by incorporating molecular and physical parameter data from large numbers of cells. In settings of deep treatment response, pre-treatment and MRD samples will be compared to define the effects of therapy on clonal architecture. The cells that exhibit particular functional properties (e.g. phenotypic non-responders) will be isolated and analyzed for genomic determinants of these properties. These data will then be incorporated into mathematical models to design and optimize therapeutic approaches that overcome the heterogeneity within individual tumors responsible for treatment failure. By pursuing this approach, our center will establish a framework that enables an iterative cycle between novel single-cell measurements from clinically-relevant specimens and computational approaches that result in testable predictions.",2017-06-07T12:06:00Z,2023-04-30T12:04:00Z,RFA-CA-15-014,nofo_RFA-CA-15-014,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,CAMBRIDGE,MA,UNITED STATES,csbc
U54CA217378,"Complexity, Cooperation and Community in Cancer","The proposed Center for Cancer Systems Biology, to be known as the Center for Complexity, Cooperation and Community in Cancer, is a joint effort by the systems biology and cancer biology communities at the University of California Irvine (UCI), as represented by two campus-wide research organizations, the Center for Complex Biological Systems and the UCI Cancer Research Institute. The center will tackle a variety of basic and fundamental questions about cancer systems, and why they are organized as they are. The premise underlying the research program of the center is that cancer cells proliferate and evolve in complex environments that have been highly selected for the robust control of growth and differentiation, and that the behaviors of cancer cells can only be fully understood in the context of the design principles that govern that control. As described in this proposal, the center will carry out three coordinated, team-oriented research projects on the role of context, cooperation and community in the initiation and progression of cancer. One project will leverage new observations from xenograft models of colon cancer to investigate non-genetic heterogeneity in solid tumors, both its origins and its relevance to tumor growth and response to therapy. A second project will investigate the cellular origins of melanoma, seeking to clarify the relationship between melanoma and the benign lesions (melanocytic nevi) that are driven by a common oncogenic event. This work will focus on interactions among melanocyte precursors, within the skin environment, and under conditions that promote progression from benign to malignant. The third project will focus on improving models of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and its treatment, taking into account interactions between hierarchical lineages, intercellular feedback, and dynamics. All three projects will combine mathematical modeling, genomics, and experimental manipulation of animal models. All three will be served by a core facility for investigating tumor cells at the single cell level, providing access to the latest in single-cell genomic, transcriptomic and other technologies. The center will also support short-term, interdisciplinary pilot projects initiated both by faculty and by trainees (graduate students and postdoctoral fellows), as well as a wide variety of outreach activities aimed at expanding and enriching the cancer systems biology community both within the university, in the larger scientific community, and among the public. Finally, the center will coordinate its research and outreach activities with those of other centers in the NCI Cancer Systems Biology network.",2018-04-01T12:04:00Z,2024-03-31T12:03:00Z,RFA-CA-15-014,nofo_RFA-CA-15-014,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,IRVINE,CA,UNITED STATES,csbc
U54CA217450,Phenotype Heterogeneity and Dynamics in SCLC,"Heterogeneity is a pervasive feature of cancer, central to progression and therapy failure. Both genetic and nongenetic factors, cell-cell and cell-microenvironment interactions contribute to tumor cell phenotypic variation. Thus, heterogeneity is a complex multiscale problem difficult to study by reductionist approaches but well suited to systems thinking. A mechanistic, system-level understanding of heterogeneity would spawn fundamental advances in cancer treatment strategies. Major challenges include definition of relevant tumor cell phenotypes, phenotype dynamics emergence from single-cell behavior and interactions, and effective targeting strategies. In our Center, we will use systems biology approaches to tackle these challenges, focusing on small cell lung cancer (SCLC), in which the impact of intratumor heterogeneity is particularly compelling. Thus, SCLC tumors, while histo-pathologically homogeneous with classic “small blue round cell” morphology, are comprised of phenotypic subpopulations (e.g., tumor-propagating cells; Hes1+ cells; CD44+ cells) that cooperate to form a tumor ecosystem adaptive to drug treatment. In SCLC genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) and patient tumors, accumulated genetic alterations (e.g., MYC amplification, NOTCH mutations) may bias phenotypic compositions and consequent drug sensitivity, underscoring the combined role of genetic and nongenetic sources. The overall goal of our proposed Center is a system-level understanding of the impact of SCLC phenotype heterogeneity in drug evasion, that will open avenues to novel treatment strategies. In two highly integrated Projects, we will combine experimentation with mathematical modeling to generate a comprehensive blueprint of SCLC phenotypic space and identify complex phenotype dynamics underlying treatment resistance. Project 1 will use high-dimensional cytometry and transcriptomics data to define human and GEMM core SCLC phenotypes, their susceptibility to genomic alteration bias, and their drug response plasticity. Project 2 will study SCLC phenotype dynamics initiated by cell-cell and secreted factors or exosomes in SCLC tumor ecosystems, using models of cell population dynamics driving tumor aggressiveness. Projects will be supported by a Single-Cell Biology and Data Analysis Shared Resource equipped with a vast palette of state-of-the-art single-cell technologies, including mass cytometry, scRNA-Seq and multidimensional data analysis. The Center will be located at Vanderbilt University and a satellite site at Stanford contributing highly-regarded SCLC GEMMs. Experimental systems will encompass human and GEMM SCLC cell lines and tumors. Our Center investigators have a track record of co-authored publications in SCLC and/or systems biology. The Administrative Core will provide leadership and communication across the Center while the Outreach Core will promote collaborations and disseminate knowledge and tools on SCLC and cancer heterogeneity. We expect that iteration between experiments and modeling will bring about a system-level understanding of SCLC tumor heterogeneity with lessons generally applicable to any cancer type.",2018-04-13T12:04:00Z,2024-03-31T12:03:00Z,RFA-CA-15-014,nofo_RFA-CA-15-014,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,Nashville,TN,UNITED STATES,csbc

U54CA224019,Architecture and Trajectory of Acquired Resistance to Therapy in AML,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Overall The long-term goal of this Program is to define mechanisms of acquired drug resistance in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) so that novel drug combinations can be deployed to prevent disease relapse and improve patient outcomes. The overall five-year survival rate for AML remains 20%, an outcome that has not changed for several decades. Although seven new regimens have been approved for AML in recent years, the improved initial remission rates with these therapies do not lead to durable outcomes. Disease relapse is fueled by a complex cross-talk of tumor cells adapting with support from the bone marrow microenvironment. The investigators of this proposed ARTNet Center have collaborated for 15+ years, including as a Center in the DRSN consortium – the predecessor to ARTNet. Our prior work has involved development of the largest-to-date functional genomic dataset on AML patient samples, genome-wide CRISPR screens, broad studies of AML interactions with stromal and immune cells, and testing of diverse drug combinations. These studies have led to >150 collaborative publications, continuous collaborative funding for 15+ years, creation of numerous large datasets deposited into public repositories, and translation of findings into numerous clinical trials. Our overarching hypothesis is that the architecture of acquired drug resistance is governed by temporal extrinsic and intrinsic factors and elucidating this trajectory will allow for the identification of properly timed therapeutic strategies to stave off acquired resistance and stay ahead of tumor evolution and adaptation. This hypothesis will be tested through three well integrated Projects addressing the following questions: 1) How does AML tumor cell intrinsic biology adapt to evade therapeutic pressure? We will use genome-wide CRISPR platforms as well as long-term progenitor expansion of primary AML patient samples to understand feedback pathways and shifting epigenetic and cell state landscapes that can drive acquired drug resistance. 2) How does the stromal and immune microenvironment govern drug resistance? We will use co-culture and advanced bone marrow models to perform genome-wide screens and test the impact of single-agents on AML-microenvironment cross-talk. Through computational modeling, we will nominate targeting strategies to mitigate tumor extrinsic resistance signals and boost immune anti-tumor responses. 3) How can resistance signatures and drug combinations be effectively clinically translated? We will use high-throughput and advanced, engineered models of human bone marrow to test and prioritize drug combinations from targets in Projects 1 and 2. We will also study longitudinal specimens from patients enrolled on ongoing clinical trials. All of these data will inform and refine the work of Projects 1 and 2. Our Center will be supported by an Administrative Core and a Functional Phenotyping Core. Collectively, we will develop a comprehensive understanding of acquired drug resistance in AML and identify new regimens to treat patients at the earliest possible stage, prevent relapse, and achieve durable remissions.",2017-09-30T12:09:00Z,2027-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-21-052,nofo_RFA-CA-21-052,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,PORTLAND,OR,UNITED STATES,artnet
U54CA224065,University of Texas PDX Development and Trial Center,"SUMMARY Our overarching goal for the University Texas PDX Development and Trial Center (UTPDTC) is to optimize personalized biomarker-based cancer therapy and identify effective targeted drugs based on the molecular characteristics of each tumor. Our short-term goals are to establish a biobank of clinically, and molecularly- annotated PDXs and to use PDXs as a platform for preclinical drug development and biomarker discovery. The primary goal for UTPDTC investigators will be to develop PDX trial strategies for preclinical testing of single agents and drug combinations. These models will allow the determination of the optimal treatments (single drugs or combinations) that should be tested in clinical trials in increasingly individualized, molecularly defined subsets of tumors. In this application we propose projects to prioritize the clinical testing of many targeted agents focused on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), colorectal cancer (CRC), pancreatic cancer (PDAC), and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) tumor subtypes, as well as patients with selected genomic alterations across other histologies. Over the past 9 years, both University of Texas MD Anderson (UTMDACC) and The University of University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center (UTSW) have established institution-wide efforts to generate novel PDX models and perform preclinical testing. Cumulatively the two institutions have hundreds of PDX models of different tumor types, including clinically-annotated models in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC, n=190 with 150 at UTMDACC and 40 at UTSW), colorectal cancer (CRC, n=127 models) pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC, n=145 models), and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC, n=44 models); four diseases where there is an urgent need for novel therapeutics. We have characterized many tumor subtypes in our existing PDXs and plan to characterize many more with the ultimate goal of developing drug combinations in defined tumor subsets in a context that can lead to clinical trials which will validate the experimental results. We plan to focus on NCI-IND agents that are primarily used by the Experimental Therapeutics Clinical Trials Network. The availability of hundreds of PDXs of diverse histologic types and molecular profiles provides a unique opportunity for synergistic interactions among the UTPDTC investigators, PDXNet, and ETCTN. Each Project will identify molecular subtypes and then test with drugs targeted to putative pathways. Similar molecular subtype profiles will be identified across projects and histologic classifications. This provides an opportunity to test the activity of drugs targeting specific molecular pathways that may be active in several histologically distinct subtypes. Such pan-histologic activity could greatly accelerate drug development. Our proposed studies focus on targeted therapeutic agents for treatment of diseases and/or molecular subtypes that have unmet medical needs. The proposed studies are highly relevant to public health, as their success will lead to effective precision therapy for cancers, for which current therapies are ineffective.",2017-09-30T12:09:00Z,2023-06-30T12:06:00Z,RFA-CA-17-003,nofo_RFA-CA-17-003,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,HOUSTON,TX,UNITED STATES,pdxnet
U54CA224070,Rational Approaches to Melanoma Therapy,"Project Summary – Overall The overarching goal of this Patient Derived Xenograft (PDX) Development and Trial Center (T-PDTC) is to develop functional precision combination therapies that can be translated into clinical trials to overcome drug resistance and produce to long-term responses improving the outcomes of melanoma patients. The melanoma treatment landscape has radically improved in the past decade due to availability of new immune- and targeted- therapies available. Targeted therapies using BRAF and MEK inhibitors have been approved for patients with BRAFV600E/K mutations, which are present in ~50% of cutaneous melanomas. These treatments elicit clinical responses in ~80% of BRAFV600 mutant patients. However, most patients eventually progress. Additionally, there are no effective targeted therapies for patients whose tumors harbor wild-type BRAF. Thus, there is an urgent unmet clinical need to develop efficacious treatments to prevent or overcome resistance to current FDA- approved therapies. To facilitate the development of new therapeutic strategies that can be translated into clinical trials, we have developed a broad collection of PDX models that reflects the clinical, histological, and genetic heterogeneity of melanoma. Our collection of >500 PDX models represents one of the largest collections for any human malignancy. Our initial studies have demonstrated that our PDX collection recapitulates the molecular heterogeneity observed in patients. This collection also includes a subset of PDX established from patients with intrinsic and acquired resistance to targeted- and immune-therapies and rare melanoma subtypes. These efforts have generated a robust pre-clinical resource to develop, refine, and prioritize new functional precision combinatorial therapies for melanoma patients. This T-PDTC constitutes a multi-disciplinary and multi- institutional Program focused on the use and continued expansion of our melanoma PDX collection and organoids to identify new therapeutic combination approaches that will fill important clinical gaps. The Program consists of two research projects and three Cores from a team that has worked extremely well together over the last five years, publishing high-impact collaborative papers. The Research Projects are designed to develop functional precision combination therapies for the most challenging types of melanomas: those that are resistant to current therapies and tumors that lack BRAF-mutations (BRAFWT). We will map the molecular landscape of our melanoma PDXs and organoids by integrating DNA, RNA, and protein data to nominate combination therapies matching their molecular profile. We will develop and implement mechanism-based preclinical trials of drug combinations in our large set of molecularly characterized PDXs. To do this, we will focus on NCI- Investigational New Drug (IND) agents to advance melanoma precision therapy, while offsetting drug resistance and producing durable responses. We expect to gain new mechanistic knowledge about the biology of drug resistant melanoma that will lead to improved and durable precision therapies. We expect to identify biomarkers to select tumors for specific treatments and provide data-driven recommendations for early phase clinical trials.",2017-09-01T12:09:00Z,2028-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-17-003;RFA-CA-22-012,nofo_RFA-CA-22-012,WISTAR INSTITUTE,PHILADELPHIA,PA,UNITED STATES,pdxnet
U54CA224076,PDX Trial Center for Breast Cancer Therapy,"Project Summary The scientific premise of this Center is that breast cancer patient-derived xenograft (PDX) and organoid models represent the diversity of human breast tumors, and can be feasibly utilized to test new drugs and drug combinations to find therapeutic approaches that match with molecular features of various tumor types. Our PDTC is focused on identifying new treatment strategies for breast cancer, which remains the 2nd leading cause of cancer death in women. We will conduct preclinical evaluation of drugs and drug combinations in models selected from our large collection of 261 breast PDX models and >100 stable PDxO lines representing primary, metastatic, and treatment-resistant breast cancers from diverse patient populations (25% of the collection is from racial/ethnic minorities, with plans to increase that proportion in Aim 1 of both research projects). The Center comprises two highly integrated Research Projects that are designed together to combat the two most difficult problems contributing to breast cancer deaths: breast cancer recurrence, and treatment of recurrent/metastatic disease. More than 90% of breast cancer deaths are attributed to disease recurrence as incurable metastatic disease. Project 1 is focused on improving therapy for early-stage triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), to prevent recurrence and achieve durable cures by identifying optimal chemotherapy and targeted therapy combinations based on molecular features of tumors. Project 2 aims to identify more effective regimens in disease that does recur (treatment-resistant, metastatic disease) by utilizing our unique collection of PDX and PDxO from metastatic samples. These two complementary research projects will be supported by a PDX Core, a Bioinformatics Core, a Pilot Projects and Trans-Network Activities Core that fosters exploration of new ideas within the PDTC and in collaboration with the PDXNetwork (PDXNet), and an Administrative Core that provides project oversight and management, and facilitates effective communication within the PDTC and the PDXNet. The overarching goal of our PDX Development and Trials Center (PDTC) is to obtain preclinical data that will facilitate prioritization of drugs to be tested in breast cancer clinical trials at the National Cancer Institute (NCI).",2017-09-25T12:09:00Z,2028-06-30T12:06:00Z,RFA-CA-17-003;RFA-CA-22-012,nofo_RFA-CA-22-012,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,SALT LAKE CITY,UT,UNITED STATES,pdxnet
U54CA224081,BAY AREA & ANDERSON TEAM AGAINST ACQUIRED RESISTANCE - U54 PROGRAM (BAATAAR-UP),"Project Summary/Abstract: The goal of this BAATAAR-UP renewal program application within the NCI ARTNet is to characterize the mechanisms of, and therapeutically counteract, acquired resistance to molecular therapies in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) by delineating the tumor-tumor microenvironment (TME) ecosystem and its plasticity during treatment. Acquired resistance is defined as tumor progression that occurs during therapy and after an initial tumor response. The overarching hypothesis is that acquired resistance to molecular therapies can be thwarted by defining and exploiting vulnerabilities in the cellular, signaling, and geographic tumor ecosystem networks that allow tumors to survive and grow during therapy. In lung cancer and other cancer types, the use of targeted therapies that inhibit important and common oncogenic driver alterations such as mutant EGFR and KRAS (G12C) and block immunosuppressive checkpoints such as PD1/PDL1 is improving patient outcomes. A major challenge to transforming cancers into chronic or curable diseases is acquired resistance, which enables lethal cancer progression in patients. Understanding the mechanisms underlying acquired resistance is essential to develop counteracting strategies that improve patient survival. During the prior NCI U54 DRSC funding period, our team uncovered several mechanisms of acquired resistance to targeted therapy in human NSCLC by studying clinical specimens and innovative patient-derived models including humanized murine models bearing patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) and patient-derived organoids (PDOs) with an intact TME. Our expert team proposes to investigate these mechanisms, and identify others, synergistically and iteratively via 3 Research Projects and optimal interactions with 2 Cores. A Data Science Core will analyze, harmonize, centralize, and share data obtained across the basic and translational continuum using innovative methods. An Administrative Core will ensure optimal project integration and internal and external interactions with the ARTNet Consortium, and scientific and lay communities. Project 1 (Clinical tumor-TME acquired resistance) is translational and uses clinical specimens and patient-derived models to test the hypothesis that tumor macrophages and tumor fibroblasts promote acquired resistance via paracrine signaling interactions including cytokine, CD47, and extracellular matrix (ECM) cues sensed by cancer cells and converging on survival pathways such as YAP and NF-kB. Project 2 (PDX tumor-TME acquired resistance) is translational and uses humanized mouse models to test the hypothesis that an immune-suppressive TME and activation of macrophage and fibroblast signaling circuits that support tumor cell survival via PDK1, YAP, and NF-kB signaling promote acquired resistance. Project 3 (PDO tumor-TME acquired resistance) is basic and uses synthetic lethal and proteomic profiling in PDOs with a TME to test the hypothesis that signaling interactions involving the ECM, TROP2, and CD47 promote acquired resistance. Synergistic, iterative interactions to study these mechanisms across projects and systems will yield robust, translatable treatment strategies to counteract acquired resistance.",2017-09-30T12:09:00Z,2027-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-21-052,nofo_RFA-CA-21-052,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",SAN FRANCISCO,CA,UNITED STATES,artnet
U54CA224083,Washington University PDX Development and Trial Center,"OVERALL PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The myriad of both newly-available molecular targets and novel anti-cancer agents has underscored the crucial need to develop preclinical models in order to optimize clinical trial design. Several technical benefits make patient-derived xenograft (PDXs) models particularly attractive for drug testing and personalized medicine. Biologists and physicians at Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM) and the Siteman Cancer Center (SCC) developed and operated the Washington University PDX Development and Trial Center (WU-PDTC) as part of the PDXNet program during a prior funding period (CA224083) from 2017-2022. Based on the success of this program, we propose to renew WU-PDTC funding as a T-PDTC with the goal of continuing our efforts in preclinical testing and prioritizing and studying unmet needs in cancer in this collaborative, nation-wide effort. The PDX Core within WU-PDTC will develop and characterize 400 new PDX models across major tumor types. These models will be characterized using the latest omics technologies and analyzed using the most current bioinformatics pipelines that have been deployed for PDXNet and other large scale NCI programs. Tumors representing unmet needs and priority areas for collection will be emphasized (e.g. treatment resistant cancers). The Bioinformatics Core will integrate these analyses with clinical annotation from the originating patient to include treatment history and tumor response (Aim 1). Our two Research Projects will conduct PDX clinical trials of single and combination agents using drugs in the NCI CTEP portfolio (Aim 2). Project 1 will investigate predictive biomarkers and resistance mechanisms for DS-8201a alone and in combination with DDRi in breast cancer (expanding to GI and lung cancers), while Project 2 will study targeting the onco-inflammatory circuitry in combination with anti-KRAS and chemotherapies in GI and lung cancer (this will expand to breast cancer). Proteogenomic, imaging, and clinical response data will be collected for these models as part of a broader effort of characterizing PDX models and conducting clinical correlation and treatment response analyses by the Bioinformatics Core (Aim 3). Proteogenomic features of PDX models and treatment/response histories will be tracked using our well-established WU-PDXdb that will be accessible to PDXNet and PDMR-FNLCR. In Aim 4, the WU-PDTC will leverage existing expertise and programs from Siteman Cancer Center (SCC), Institute of Clinical and Translational Research (ITCS), McDonnell Genome Institute (MGI), Mallinkrodt Imaging Research Center (MIRC), and Early Therapeutic Clinical Trials Network (ETCTN) to support the goals of developing and utilizing PDX models to test and improve cancer treatment, in collaboration with other components of PDXNet. Finally, WU-PDTC, through coordination by the Administration Core, will support Pilot Projects utilizing these PDX resources to foster collaboration across PDTCs, PDMR-FNLCR, and other NCI programs (Aim 5). In summary, the goals are to increase the spectrum of agents tested in PDX clinical trials and to improve the reliability, validation, utility, and standardization of PDX models through innovative cross-PDXNet research.",2017-09-30T12:09:00Z,2028-07-31T12:07:00Z,RFA-CA-17-003;RFA-CA-22-012,nofo_RFA-CA-22-012,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,SAINT LOUIS,MO,UNITED STATES,pdxnet
U54CA225088,Systems Pharmacology of Therapeutic and Adverse Responses to ImmuneCheckpoint and Small Molecule Drugs,"SUMMARY- OVERALL COMPONENT We will establish a Center for Cancer Systems Pharmacology (CSP Center) that constructs and applies network-level computational models to understand mechanisms of drug response, resistance and toxicity for targeted small molecule drugs and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). We hypothesize that improved understanding of fundamental cell signaling pathways and interactions between cancer and immune cells will result in greater efficacy while minimizing toxicity. Intrinsic and acquired drug resistance pose the primary challenges to broader application of all cancer therapies. By systematically dissecting how resistance to targeted therapies and ICIs arises, we aim to understand and overcome resistance mechanisms using new drugs or drug combinations, while simultaneously predicting and balancing potential toxicities. These goals will be accomplished by translating findings from the bedside to the bench and then back to the bedside focusing on melanoma, a type of cancer in which both ICIs and targeted drugs are effective, and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and brain cancers (GBM) for which ICIs are not approved but where sporadic responses have been observed. We will develop, validate and apply innovative pharmacological concepts and instantiate these in practical form using computational models. Such models will explicitly consider the impact of mutations, phenotypic variability, cell-to-cell interaction and the composition of the tumor microenvironment in mechanisms of action of sequential or simultaneous combinations of targeted drugs and ICIs. Hypothesis generation will focus on deep phenotyping of patient-derived specimens followed by hypothesis testing in pre- clinical settings using complementary multi-omic and computational methods. We will also create and distribute new measurement and software methods to promote systems pharmacology in other areas of cancer biology. Aim 1 will establish an Administrative Core to oversee and coordinate all center activities. Aim 2 will establish a Systems Pharmacology Core to coordinate experimental and computational resources for proteomic, transcriptomic, metabolomic and imaging assays across all three Projects. Aim 3 will establish an Outreach core that promotes training via a website and seminars and ensures curation and distribution of Center data according to FAIR standards. Aim 4 (Project 1) will develop multi-scale computational models of adaptive drug resistance in melanoma that capture and ultimately explain the wide diversity of changes in cell states associated with resistance to RAF/MEK inhibitors. Aim 5 (Project 2) will measure and model the tumor microenvironment before and during treatment, and at the time of drug resistance using a range of innovative, highly-multiplexed assays for malignant and non-malignant cells. Aim 6 (Project 3) will measure and model cell type-specific metabolic, signaling, and transcriptional mechanisms that contribute to the efficacy of ICI combinations, in order to develop improved therapeutic strategies for patients unresponsive to monotherapy.",2018-03-08T12:03:00Z,2023-02-28T12:02:00Z,RFA-CA-15-014,nofo_RFA-CA-15-014,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,BOSTON,MA,UNITED STATES,csbc
U54CA231630,Defining and targeting the molecular vulnerabilities of the PAX3-FOXO1 protein in rhabdomyosarcoma,"ABSTRACT – Overall (revised) Fusion-positive alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (ARMS) remains one of the most fatal but least understood cancers of childhood. The driving oncoprotein in ARMS is the PAX3-FOXO1 fusion protein, a chimeric transcription factor that hijacks normal gene expression and chromatin state. Five-year survival for children with PAX3-FOXO1- positive ARMS is ~30% for all-comers, and <10% when metastatic. Despite the discovery of PAX3-FOXO1 in 1993, treatment strategies for affected children remain unchanged. This deficiency stems equally from a lack of understanding of the basic biology of the disease and an inability to directly target the fusion protein. No systematic or comprehensive approach has been undertaken to identify the proteins and regulatory elements required to support PAX3-FOXO1-mediated tumorigenesis. As a result, the field has been limited to a patchwork of data with no unified scientific strategy. To overcome this, this FusOnC2 Center has an innovative team and dynamic environment in which data interpretation is informed by complementary technological approaches and by biological and clinical knowledge. This comprehensive approach will transform understanding of PAX3-FOXO1-mediated oncogenesis and create opportunities for therapeutic intervention. The Center’s overarching goal is to advance the therapeutic tractability of the PAX3-FOXO1 fusion protein in ARMS by comprehensively identifying the druggable co-regulators, modulators, and intrinsic activities of PAX3-FOXO1. To accomplish this goal, the Center includes two complementary Projects, each led by expert RMS biologists paired with specialists in pioneering experimental approaches undertaking the most cutting-edge research in cancer biology, genomics, proteomics, structural biology, and medicinal chemistry. The Projects will be supported by RMS investigators within each project who will provide curated RMS cell lines, unique human primary RMS tumor cells, and murine models to enable rapid in vitro and in vivo validation and cross-prioritization of targets. An Administrative Core will integrate and coordinate the Center components, providing leadership and oversight, and promoting cross-pollination of ideas and resources. The Overall Specific Aims are to: (1) define and target the PAX3-FOXO1 interactome; and (2) perform chemical probe discovery for PAX3-FOXO1 to create additional tools for investigating the fundamental biology and tractability of PAX3-FOXO1 and fusion-positive RMS. Approaches used include proximity labeling, saturation mutagenesis, single and combinatorial CRISPR screens, high-throughput phenotypic assays, and mechanistically unbiased approaches to chemical probe discovery using novel high-throughput binding assays. We will use information gleaned to prioritize targets and agents for validation and to inform compound optimization and PROTAC preparation. This Center’s strengths and resources will synergize with the FusOnC2 Consortium, speeding development of knowledge generalizable to the biology of multiple fusion oncoproteins in childhood cancers, accelerating advances in clinical care.",2019-09-17T12:09:00Z,2024-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-19-016,nofo_RFA-CA-19-016,DUKE UNIVERSITY,DURHAM,NC,UNITED STATES,fusonc2
U54CA231637,The Center for Therapeutic Targeting of EWS-oncoproteins,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Overall The primary scientific focus of this Center is to understand the molecular underpinnings of EWS-ETS driven Ewing sarcoma and to investigate novel treatments and therapeutic mechanisms to improve outcomes for pediatric patients with this aggressive disease. Translation of molecular understanding of sarcoma pathophysiology into effective new drugs in the clinic is a complex, risky proposition that requires the coordinated efforts of a talented team of individuals with complementary skills. This group brings expertise in Ewing sarcoma biology and the EWS-ETS oncoproteins, epigenetics and transcription, structural biology, computational biology, chemical biology and drug development, mouse models, preclinical experimental therapeutics, and clinical trials development. A Center mechanism is essential to the success of this proposal. No one institution nor individual can bring mastery of the diversity of approaches, technologies, and scientific domains needed to achieve the goals of this proposal. We have elected to focus on understanding the fundamental inner workings of Ewing sarcoma from its transcriptional circuits, to the direct protein interactions with EWS-FLI1, to the direct and immediate effects of EWS-FLI1 degradation. Moreover, a strong emphasis of this proposal is on target identification and preclinical validation, critical steps in the process of bringing forward therapies with optimal chances for success in the clinic. The team that is assembled has all of the component pieces needed for success. Our Center includes outstanding basic cancer biologists, chemists, computational biologists, and translational researchers, and five pediatric oncologists. Thus, the proposed Center can catalyze basic discovery and clinical translation by leveraging basic and clinical research talent within the Center and our strong ties to outside academic and industrial partners.",2018-09-10T12:09:00Z,2024-06-30T12:06:00Z,RFA-CA-17-049,nofo_RFA-CA-17-049,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,BOSTON,MA,UNITED STATES,fusonc2
U54CA231638,The Center for Synovial Sarcoma Biology and Therapeutics,"The Center for Synovial Sarcoma Biology and Therapeutics Abstract The overarching goal of this FusOnC2 Center for Synovial Sarcoma Biology and Therapeutics is to develop and execute a comprehensive, multidisciplinary set of approaches rooted in protein biochemistry and structural biology to define the mechanistic underpinnings of synovial sarcoma and unmask opportunities for therapeutic development. This Center’s mission is tightly aligned with that of the larger Consortium on Fusion Oncoproteins in Childhood Cancers and the Beau Biden Cancer Moonshot Initiative. A major impetus for the development of this Consortium has been the growing knowledge that fusion oncoproteins that are pathognomonic for specific cancer types often function via disruption of the structure and/or activity of protein complexes that govern chromatin architecture and hence gene control. We have shown that at least two of the fusion oncoproteins highlighted as major areas of emphasis within the Consortium, SS18-SSX and EWS-FLI1, bind and act via BAF complexes to drive cancer-specific oncogenic gene expression. Importantly, genetic studies across human cancer types have indicated that genes encoding encoding mSWI/SNF complex subunits are among the most frequently mutated, at over 20% of all human cancers, further underscoring the need for a detailed understanding of BAF complex structure, topology and mechanisms on chromatin. Our multi-institutional collaborative network seeks to comprehensively interrogate biologic mechanisms underpinning the function of the SS18-SSX oncogenic fusion protein in synovial sarcoma and to use the approaches and the results generated to launch targeted therapeutic discovery campaigns that are directly linked to the mechanisms identified. Specifically, our approach encompasses three major areas: (1) BAF complex genomic targeting, gene regulation, and chromatin state interactions, including interactions with other chromatin regulators; (2) Understanding the role of the wild-type SS18 protein, its protein-level regulation, and mechanisms by which its stabilization can reverse SS18-SSX-mediated BAF complex activity and be exploited for therapeutic benefit; (3) Mechanistically characterizing synovial sarcoma-specific vulnerabilities, centered in chromatin-bound protein complexes and related pathways. The highly integrative nature of the PI-directed research projects and expertise within collaborator laboratories provide the strongest possible likelihood that the aims will be successfully achieved and that novel therapeutic strategies will emerge from this Center.",2018-09-18T12:09:00Z,2024-06-30T12:06:00Z,RFA-CA-17-049,nofo_RFA-CA-17-049,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,BOSTON,MA,UNITED STATES,fusonc2
U54CA231641,An integrated approach to analyze and target EWS/FLI in Ewing sarcoma,"Overall Section Summary/Abstract The overarching goal of our FusOnC2 TEST (Targeting the Ewing Sarcoma Translocation) Center is to develop a new mechanistic understanding of EWS/FLI that will allow for the development of new therapeutic approaches for Ewing sarcoma based on inhibiting EWS/FLI. EWS/FLI is an aberrant oncogenic transcription factor formed by the t(11;22)(q24;q12) chromosomal translocation that is the driver oncoprotein of this tumor. Multiple independent studies demonstrate a critical dependence of Ewing sarcoma cells on EWS/FLI such that blockade of the translocation is associated with a loss of proliferation, loss of cell cycle progression and ultimately reversal of oncogenic transformation. Thus, most investigators believe that inhibition of EWS/FLI in the clinic would be the best way to treat patients with Ewing sarcoma. Traditional chemical design of EWS/FLI inhibitors has proven challenging because the molecule does not contain traditionally “druggable” pockets. We therefore hypothesize that a deeper scientific understanding of EWS/FLI transcriptional function in Ewing sarcoma will allow for identification of new agents. The FusOnC2 TEST Center will focus on two critical molecular features of EWS/FLI required for its transcriptional and oncogenic function: (i) binding of EWS/FLI to GGAA-microsatellites and related DNA response elements, and (ii) EWS/FLI self-association activities to form “hubs” that coordinate protein-interactions through low-complexity domains to mediate transcriptional function. Targeting EWS/FLI requires diverse expertise to be focused on this problem. The TEST Center is designed to facilitate both independent and highly-focused studies on critical components of EWS/FLI function, while at the same time interacting with the entire FusOnC2 consortium to share new knowledge, techniques, and expertise that will help facilitate the development of new therapeutic approaches to Ewing sarcoma. We believe that the TEST Center will contribute greatly to the overall success of the FusOnC2 Consortium, and help to change the paradigm for how new therapies are developed for pediatric translocation-associated cancers.",2018-09-18T12:09:00Z,2023-06-30T12:06:00Z,RFA-CA-17-049,nofo_RFA-CA-17-049,RESEARCH INST NATIONWIDE CHILDREN'S HOSP,COLUMBUS,OH,UNITED STATES,fusonc2
U54CA231649,"Targeting EWSR1-FLI1 through Functional, Structural and Chemical Approaches","Ewing sarcoma is the second most common bone and soft tissue malignancy in children and adolescents. The five-year survival of Ewing sarcoma patients is 70%, and falls to less than 20% for those with metastatic disease, a situation that has not improved despite many years of increasingly intensive chemotherapy regimens. Survivors of Ewing sarcoma often suffer long-term deleterious effects of treatment. An immediate need exists for the development of effective, targeted therapies with decreased toxicity. Molecularly, Ewing sarcoma is characterized by one of several reciprocal chromosomal translocations that fuse a FET family protein with an ETS transcription factor, the most common of which is EWSR1-FLI1. The EWSR1-FLI1 fusion protein is completely specific to Ewing sarcoma tumor cells, and thus presents an ideal target for novel therapeutics. To date, however, no such targeted therapy has become clinically available, owing to 4 major knowledge gaps. First, there is a dearth of robust in vitro model systems for functional studies of EWSR1-FLI1. Knockdown studies in Ewing sarcoma cell lines can give inconsistent results, and few primary cell types tolerate exogenous EWSR1-FLI1 expression. Second, the protein encoded by the EWSR1-FLI1 fusion is a transcription factor, and there is widespread perception that such proteins are “undruggable”. Third, lead candidates of small-molecule screens reported to date have either not been shown to have a mechanistic link to EWSR1-FLI1, or fail to replicate the phenotype of Ewing sarcoma cells depleted of EWSR1-FLI1 activity. Fourth, the field has lacked relevant animal models for functional genomics and preclinical testing. Developing targeted therapy for Ewing sarcoma will require an integrated approach executed by an experienced team. Our strategy is based on several fundamentals, namely 1) systems to specifically deplete and reconstitute the EWSR1-FLI1 protein in cells; 2) an understanding of the structural biochemistry of low-complexity (LC) domains found in EWSR1 and related proteins; and 3) novel in vivo models of Ewing sarcoma for functional genomics and drug testing. Standing on this foundation, we will perform biochemical and genetic experiments to identify the binding partners and functional effectors of EWSR1-FLI1 and dissect its mechanisms of transcriptional activation. We will use our experimental systems to conduct phenotypic and target-based high- throughput screens. Finally, we are well-positioned to perform the work required to transform a compound with promising initial activity into a preclinical drug lead. Our approach to drug discovery is built upon medicinal chemistry coupled with secondary assays that maximize potency and specificity of lead compounds. We will perform target identification for lead compounds using strategies our team has successfully used for several agents currently in active preclinical development. A dedicated preclinical pharmacology core, highly integrated with the projects and with the high throughput screening core and medicinal chemistry core, will ensure optimization of delivery, PK/PD and toxicity properties of the most promising lead compounds.",2019-09-16T12:09:00Z,2024-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-19-016,nofo_RFA-CA-19-016,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,DALLAS,TX,UNITED STATES,fusonc2
U54CA231652,Targeting SS18-SSX biology in synovial sarcomagenesis,"Overall: PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This application responds to RFA-CA-17-049 by proposing the establishment of a center distributed across three institutions with labs all focusing on the biology of the SS18-SSX (formerly called SYT-SSX) fusion oncogene. Among the FusOnC2 consortium cancers of interest, synovial sarcoma has the highest incidence in the United States and worldwide, but has been a specifically underserved malignancy due to its predilection for the adolescent and young adult population and its relatively poor responsiveness to systemic therapy, compared to other pediatric sarcomas that also associate with fusion oncogenes. While much of the biology of SS18-SSX remains unknown and synovial sarcoma patients represent a clearly underserved, orphan-disease population, there are two principles at the extremes of the cancer biology spectrum that are well established. First, SS18-SSX has proven the capacity to recapitulate synovial sarcomagenesis faithfully in the mouse without the need of introduced or stochastically acquired secondary genetic changes, second SS18-SSX has biochemically demonstrated interactions with an important chromatin remodeling complex called SWI/SNF or BAF. This application proposes to build three research projects focused on the cell biology of transformation, genome-wide chromatin biology and SWI/SNF (BAF) complex componentry biology, each related to SS18- SSX. These discovery biology and therapeutic target identification efforts will be supported by two shared resource cores that will provide human validation of therapeutic targets and preclinical testing of therapeutic strategies. The group of investigators has developed as an organically assembled network of collaborations, built over the last decade, during which time each project has gathered substantial preliminary data using a variety of functional screens, a newly identified cell of origin, the ability to track SS18-SSX genome wide localization and protein interactions, a powerful system to produce and evaluate recombinant SWI/SNF (BAF) complexes with variable componentry, and powerful mouse genetic models of synovial sarcoma—including spontaneous development of metastatic disease. Preliminary data are sufficiently robust to recommend therapeutic strategies immediately from each research project for the cores to validate and evaluate in clinically relevant mouse models and quantitative molecular imaging.",2018-09-14T12:09:00Z,2024-06-30T12:06:00Z,RFA-CA-17-049,nofo_RFA-CA-17-049,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,SALT LAKE CITY,UT,UNITED STATES,fusonc2

U54CA243124,Experimental and preclinical modeling of NUP98-rearranged acute leukemia,"PROJECT SUMMARY - Overview Fusion oncoproteins (FO) arising from the rearrangement of Nucleoporin 98 (NUP98) to a diverse range of partner genes are a hallmark of multiple subtypes of high risk myeloid malignancies in children and adolescents, including acute erythroleukemia and acute megakaryoblastic leukemia. Such leukemias are associated with poor outcome, and more effective therapies are required. The long-term goal of this Center for Experimental and Preclinical Modeling of NUP98 Leukemia is to determine the molecular role, and potential vulnerabilities, of NUP98-fusion oncoproteins in leukemia through the development and interrogation of human and mouse model systems, and to develop and test novel therapeutic approaches. The Center has assembled a consortium of investigators with complementary expertise in genomic characterization, leukemia modeling, chromatin biology, structural biology and preclinical modeling. The Center is led by Dr Charles Mullighan of St Jude Children’s Research Hospital together with Project Co-Leaders Drs Scott Armstrong (Dana Farber Cancer Institute), Taosheng Chen (St Jude), Alex Kentsis (Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Institute), Jeffery Klco (St Jude) and Richard Kriwacki (St Jude). These investigators will co-Lead four projects performing experimental modeling (Project 1), investigating chromatin biology (Project 2), phase separation (Project 3) and drug development (Project 4) that will address the following questions and unmet needs: (1) to define how NUP98 fusions drive leukemogenesis using complementary, integrative engineered models and proteomic, transcriptomic and epigenomic profiles; (2) to develop genetically faithful engineered mouse, human and xenograft models of NUP98 leukemia for mechanistic interrogation and preclinical modeling; (3) to define the macromolecular chromatin and protein complexes assembled by NUP98 FOs; (4) to define the role of phase separation in NUP98 FO leukemogenesis; (5) to define the dependencies and vulnerabilities of NUP98-rearranged leukemic cells; and (6) to develop more effective therapeutic strategies for NUP98-rearranged leukemia. The Center is supported by an Administrative Core A that with an External Advisory Board will oversee project progress interaction and reporting, a Genome Editing Core B led by Dr David Chen (City of Hope) that provides expertise and support for CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing scans and screens; and a Chemistry Core C led by Dr Zoran Rankovic (St Jude) that supports chemical library screen and drug design and development. This highly integrated, interactive and synergistic Center will provide fundamental insights into the mechanisms of oncogenesis of the different classes of NUP98 FO, and new therapeutic modalities that will be validated in preclinical models and translated into human clinical trials.

U54CA243126,Center for therapeutic targeting of the Fusion Oncoprotein of Fibrolamellar Hepatocellular Carcinoma,"Project Summary / Abstract Fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma (FLC) is a usually lethal primary tumor in children, adolescents and young adults. The primary tumor is initiated and driven by a single alteration in the DNA: A deletion of ~400kb that results in a fusion gene between the heat shock co-chaperone DNAJB1 and the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A, PRKACA. If the tumor is limited to the liver, then surgery is the accepted therapy. However, if the tumor has metastasized, there is no accepted therapy. This project will determine how the fusion oncoprotein leads to pathogenesis and will develop therapeutics targeted to the fusion oncoprotein. Pathogenesis is being probed by examining what is different about the fusion oncoprotein that causes changes in the cell. Therapeutics will target the fusion oncoprotein through small molecules to block activity, or small molecules to send it to the proteasome, or small molecules for allosteric inhibition.",2019-09-20T12:09:00Z,2024-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-19-016,nofo_RFA-CA-19-016,ROCKEFELLER UNIVERSITY,NEW YORK,NY,UNITED STATES,fusonc2
U54CA244438,UCSF Center for Synthetic Immunology: Tools to Reprogram the Immune System to Combat Cancer,"Project Summary/Abstract UCSF Center for Synthetic Immunology: Tools to Reprogram the Immune System to Combat Cancer The immune system has emerged as an extraordinarily powerful tool for combating cancer. One of the most potent agents are engineered T cells programmed to recognize and kill tumor cells. Nonetheless, our ability to engineer T cells and other immune cells and program them to execute new functions remains relatively primitive. Aside from CAR T cells for treatment of blood cancers, most engineered cell therapies are risky, potentially highly toxic, unreliable and often ineffective, especially those cell therapies that attempt to target solid cancers. We hypothesize that to fulfil the promise of engineered immune cell therapies, we must first transform cell engineering into a systematic and predictable process; one that uses reliable technology platforms and principles. Our center will focus on developing a set of sophisticated immune engineering platforms that address three major needs in next-generation cell therapies: 1) Smart recognition of cancer – develop antigen-pattern recognition circuits that direct immune cells to optimally recognize solid tumors and discriminate against normal tissue crossreaction, guided by computational bioinformatic analysis of gene expression patterns. 2) Overcoming the tumor microenvironment – develop multiple classes of cellular circuits that can overcome or locally remodel immune-suppressive tumor microenvironments to promote highly efficient therapeutic immune cell trafficking, proliferation, persistence, and tumor-killing activity 3) User-control and safety – to increase control over and safety of these powerful engineered cells, we will develop a suite of ways to communicate with and control the activity of engineered immune cells in vivo, including nano/microparticles and small molecules. To achieve these goals, we have assembled the UCSF Center for Synthetic Immunology, a tightly integrated interdisciplinary team that encompasses synthetic biologists, immunologists, bio-informaticists, control engineers, and materials scientists. The products of this center will include publicly available toolkits of parts and circuits for cell engineering, high-throughput platforms for rapid circuit assembly, new programmable nanomaterials for controlling immune cell behavior, searchable bioinformatic databases for optimization of tumor recognition, and computational frameworks for circuit design and for modeling/prototyping in vivo circuit function. These platforms will help to advance immune cell engineering to be far more reliable, predictable, effective and safe.",2019-09-24T12:09:00Z,2024-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-19-013,nofo_RFA-CA-19-013,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",SAN FRANCISCO,CA,UNITED STATES,iotn
U54CA244711,Engineering the Next Generation of T Cells,"OVERALL SUMMARY This U54 “Immuno-engineering to Improve Immunotherapy (i3) Center” was developed in response to RFA-CA-19-013. The purpose of this U54 is to employ immuno-engineering principles to design more durable, accessible, and less toxic immunoprevention and immunotherapy strategies. A national priority set by the Cancer Moonshot initiative is to support studies incorporating next-generation genetic engineering, engineered biomaterials, nanotechnology, computational and mathematical modelling, or systems biology approaches in the design, implementation and evaluation of next generation immunotherapies focused on overcoming immunosuppressive barriers, targeting tumor cells for killing, and generating long-lasting anti-cancer immunological memory. The focus of our U54 entitled “Engineering the next generation of T cells” is on developing next-generation gene-editing or modification of immune cells to improve persistence in vivo, control and manipulate the immune system to reduce oﬀ-target toxicities and enhance anti-tumor eﬀectiveness of adoptive cell therapy. Our central hypothesis is that next generation engineering can improve the safety and efficacy of CAR T cells while decreasing the cost of goods. There are three scientific projects in our U54 Center. The shared goal of these projects is to enable this powerful therapy to reach a broader spectrum of patients with blood cancer and solid cancers. In Project 1, we are using CRISPR/Cas9 to edit the epigenome of T cells and to make cells resistant to cytokine release syndrome (CRS), while employing engineering technologies to automate CAR T cell culture. The goal of Project 2 is to generate universal CAR T cells (UCART) using advanced genetic editing technologies and then to compare UCAR to autologous CAR T in a unique model of canine cancer. In Project 3 we will use advanced protein engineering, cell engineering and oncolytic vectors to test synthetic cytokine and cytokine receptor systems in mouse and human T cells, with the long-term goal of eliminating or reducing the need for lymphodepleting conditioning chemotherapy prior to adoptive cell transfer. Our approach is multidisciplinary and multi- institutional. We have brought together a cadre of exceptional investigators from multiple disciplines who have collaborated and published together for many years. State of the art genetic editing with CRISPR/Cas9 and cell culture technologies at the University of Pennsylvania are synergistically coupled with world-class protein engineering and structural biology at Stanford University. Each project is led by recognized authorities in the field. The Administrative Core for this U54 is designed to manage and coordinate all i3 Center Research Project activities and serve as the liaison between the i3 Center and the IOTN Data Management and Resource-sharing Center (U24) and other Cancer Moonshot consortia, including the Pediatric Immunotherapy Discovery and Development Network (PI-DDN). In addition, the Administrative Core will coordinate collaborative research activities between the i3 Center Research Project PD(s)/PI(s) and IOTN (or other) investigators. The potential for paradigm-shifting impact this U54 is to transform the lessons of first-generation CAR T for leukemia and lymphoma into meaningful efficacy against all malignancies.",2019-09-25T12:09:00Z,2024-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-19-013,nofo_RFA-CA-19-013,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,PHILADELPHIA,PA,UNITED STATES,iotn
U54CA244719,Nano-Immuno-Oncology Approaches to Overcome Tumor Immune Evasion,"Abstract While immunotherapies have achieved remarkable success in cancer care in recent years, a large percentage of patients remain unresponsive to currently available treatments. Growing evidence indicates dysfunctional innate and adaptive immune responses in the tumor microenvironment are responsible for tumor evasion that limits the efficacy of the current immunotherapies. Efficacious cancer immunotherapy requires a holistic, system approach to identify and engage key molecular and cellular pathways as well as tumor microenvironment signals to benefit a broad spectrum of cancer patients. The overarching goal of this U54 i3 Center application is to harness research synergy in immunobiology, protein engineering and cancer nanotechnology to develop and validate new nano-immuno-oncology therapeutics for cancer therapy. Four investigators, Zhijian `James' Chen, Yang-Xin Fu, Baran Sumer, and Jinming Gao, supported by the Administrative Core, will advance the frontier of knowledge of molecular and cellular engineering of the tumor immune milieu for robust antitumor immunity. Each project will bring a unique toolset and therapeutic strategy to tackle the immune refractory challenges in solid tumors. Dr. Chen will lead Project 1 to investigate the role of cGAS-STING pathway in intrinsic tumor immunity and evaluate antitumor efficacy of cGAMP nanoparticles in endogenous tumor models. Dr. Fu will lead Project 2 to engineer tumor-targeted delivery of CD47 and T cell activators (IL-2/IL-15) to stimulate innate and adaptive antitumor immunity in the tumor microenvironment. Dr. Gao and Dr. Sumer will lead Project 3 to establish CD47-encoded ultra-pH sensitive nanoparticles as a broad nanoplatform for tumor-targeted delivery of innate and adaptive immune modulators. If successful, our studies will develop innovative and synergistic combinations of small molecular agonists, engineered antibodies and cytokines, and pH sensitive nanoparticle technology. The U54 i3 Center will create a new paradigm for cancer immunotherapy by targeting key molecular, cellular and tumor microenvironment signals to generate and sustain tumor-specific innate and adaptive immunity. Ultimately, this paradigm could significantly advance clinical care for patients with intractable cancers.",2019-09-24T12:09:00Z,2024-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-19-013,nofo_RFA-CA-19-013,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,DALLAS,TX,UNITED STATES,iotn
U54CA244726,Biomaterials to Create T Cell Immunity,"Summary – Overall: T lymphocyte (T cell) responses against tumor antigens are key to cancer immunotherapy, and this proposal is focused on enhancing T cell mediated anti-cancer immunity using biomaterials. Defects in T cell number, differentiation, activation and anti-cancer activity can compromise anti-cancer immunity. We envision biomaterials that act at various stages of T cell differentiation and activation to enhance anti-cancer immunity in a number of settings. This i3 Center will advance efficacious biomaterial-based immunotherapies through marrying the expertise in bioengineering from accomplished investigators at the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering with the expertise in cancer immunology, stem cell biology, and clinical oncology from accomplished basic and translational scientists at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Massachusetts General Hospital. Our groups have made major contributions to the development of checkpoint blockade therapy, neoantigen vaccines, cellular therapies, and therapeutic biomaterials in the past, and here will take a material- based approach to address a number of related, fundamental questions in immunoengineering. The Specific Aims of the i3 Center are: (1) To develop artificial antigen presenting cells that closely mimic normal T cell activation to selectively expand large numbers of highly functional polyclonal antigen-specific CD8 T cells, and explore if adoptive transfer of polyclonal T cells will provide tumor control. (2) Determine if co-delivery of neoantigens and adjuvants with precise nanoscale distribution and stoichiometric loading, using DNA origami, can provide a powerful platform to boost the development of cytotoxic T lymphocyte anti-cancer responses, and (3) Create biomaterials which recreate key features of the normal hematopoietic stem cell niche, and utilize to enable rapid reconstitution of T cells in settings where there are deficiencies in T cell number and repertoire, in order to enhance generation of T cell-mediated anti-cancer immunity. The leadership and organizational structure of the i3 Center, which includes a Biostatistics Core, reflect the close collaboration among the participating disciplines and institutions, and will promote the effective execution of the proposed work and its future translation to clinical testing. The synergistic set of activities in the i3 not only address specific stages where immune control can fail, but the lessons learned and technologies developed in each project strongly impact the others. The Center is expected to yield major scientific and translational advances in cancer immunotherapy.",2019-09-25T12:09:00Z,2024-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-19-013,nofo_RFA-CA-19-013,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,CAMBRIDGE,MA,UNITED STATES,iotn
U54CA254518,The East Africa Consortium for HPV and Cervical Cancer in Women living with HIV/AIDS,"Overall Abstract Sub-Saharan Africa contains 70% of the world’s diagnosed cases of HIV/AIDS, with both Uganda and Kenya at its epicenter (12% and 7% prevalence, respectively). Within East Africa, cervical cancer remains one of the most common malignancies in women. HIV is a contributing factor for cervical carcinogenesis with HIV-infected women having a greater incidence and persistence of human papilloma virus (HPV) infections, cervical cancer, and precancerous cervical lesions. In contrast to other HIV-associated cancers, the incidence of cervical cancer has not declined in the era of antiretroviral therapy. The core objective of this application is to better elucidate the natural history of HPV infection and cervical cancer in HIV-infected women, including the cofactors involved in carcinogenesis, the persistence and progression of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) after LEEP, and to identify new viral and cellular biomarkers that will assist in screening, triage and treatment. Our central hypothesis is that the incidence, persistence, and spectrum of high risk (HR) HPV are substantially greater in HIV-infected East African women, and that this explains the higher incidence of cervical neoplasia. We further hypothesize that these and other modifiable factors, such as aflatoxin ingestion, disproportionately and adversely influence outcomes of local therapies such as Loop Electrosurgical Excision Procedure (LEEP) in HIV-infected women. The specific aims for the East Africa Consortium for HPV and Cervical Cancer (EACHC) in Women Living with HIV/AIDS are: Specific Aim 1. To establish a sustainable research infrastructure for an international partnership to conduct impactful research in HPV and cervical cancer in women living with HIV/AIDS Specific Aim 2. To design and execute three integrated projects that advance the knowledge of the environmental and biologic factors leading to cervical cancer in East Africa: Project 1- Preventing cervical cancer in HIV-infected women Project 2- Understanding CIN2+ among HIV infected women after LEEP: An epidemiological and immunohistochemical study Project 3- Determining biological and viral factors associated with clinical progression of cervical dysplasia in HIV-infected women Specific Aim 3.

U54CA254564,"Innovations for screening and prognosis in HIV+ cancers including Kaposi sarcoma, cervical cancer, and lymphoma in Malawi and South Africa","ABSTRACT: OVERALL COMPONENT: Innovations for screening and prognosis in HIV+ cancers including Kaposi sarcoma, cervical cancer, and lymphoma in Malawi and South Africa In response to RFA-CA-20-001, this application proposes to establish the UNC-Malawi-South Africa Cancer Consortium (UMSACC), to develop capacity and conduct high-impact research focused on HIV-associated cancers. The consortium builds on longstanding collaborations between the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Lighthouse Trust in Malawi, Malawi Ministry of Health, Malawi College of Medicine, the University of the Witwatersrand, South Africa, and Stellenbosch University, South Africa. These partnerships have been made possible by leadership and participation in NIH networks conducting basic, clinical and epidemiologic research in the region. These existing relationships and robust infrastructure can now be leveraged for HIV- associated malignancies, which are overwhelming contributors to cancer burden in Malawi and South Africa even after widespread antiretroviral therapy usage. UMSACC is focused on the three most common HIV- associated cancers, Kaposi sarcoma (KS), cervical cancer, and lymphoma, and addresses the NIH HIV/AIDS research priorities by focusing on HIV-associated comorbidities which includes these AIDS-defining cancers. UMSACC proposes innovations for screening and prognosis of these cancers in persons living with HIV (PLWH) with the overall goal being to improve the health of PLWH. Our consortium will be led by principal investigators with highly complementary expertise using a team science approach. To support consortium objectives, a diverse team of investigators has been assembled spanning the clinical, population, and basic sciences, and includes Malawian, South African, and US scientific leaders. Moreover, a high priority is the training and support of junior investigators in the U.S. and Africa. The consortium will enhance existing administrative, operational, and research relationships between all partnering institutions and investigators. The External Advisory Board and Scientific Advisors will ensure that the consortium remains highly responsive to community needs in Malawi and South Africa, while also addressing urgent research questions facing the international HIV-associated cancer community. A focus of this consortium is to develop Malawi and South Africa to become international leaders in HIV- associated cancer research. Building on prior successes and partnerships outlined in this application, UMSACC is extremely well-positioned to catalyze a broad, coordinated, cancer control effort in Malawi and South Africa, and to advance the overall NCI scientific agenda for sub-Saharan Africa to reduce HIV- associated cancer burden in low- and middle-income countries.",2020-08-13T12:08:00Z,2025-07-31T12:07:00Z,RFA-CA-20-001,nofo_RFA-CA-20-001,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,CHAPEL HILL,NC,UNITED STATES,hamrcs
U54CA254565,HIV and HCC in Africa: The H2A Consortium,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a very common and lethal cancer in Africa, and as patients with HIV live longer, the HCC burden may increase. In prior studies, our team identified chronic infection with hepatitis B and C viruses (HBV, HCV), HIV and Schistosomiasis mansoni as independent risk factors for HCC. Compared to the US, HCC in sub-Saharan Africa occurs at younger age and more advanced stage with survival of only months. Proposed is an East and West African partnership between colleagues at Makerere University in Uganda, Fann University in Senegal and Johns Hopkins University focused on HIV and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in Africa: The H2A Consortium. Building on long-standing collaborative research, mentoring and clinical activities in both countries, our overarching goal is to reduce the heavy burden of HCC in sub- Saharan Africa. We advocate investigating cancer interception strategies using appropriate medical treatments to interrupt or reverse the impact of these HCC-causing infections. We will accomplish this objective by developing local capacity and performing important research. Consortium activities are designed to enhance both the clinical, population and translational research infrastructure and individual African investigator capacity to conduct high-level, collaborative investigation of HIV, chronic infections and HCC. First, we will form a large, prospective cohort of HBV and HBV/HIV co-infected persons to define who needs HBV treatment, determine clinical responses, and characterize breakthrough HCC, while investigating novel biomarkers. To understand our data demonstrating synergistic interaction between chronic HBV and Sm infections, we will examine HBV clinical and immunological responses in the periphery and the liver in response to Sm treatment. HIV is investigated as a key modifier of these relationships in both projects. Integrated within our scientific agenda, early-stage African investigators will be provided mentoring and career development support while conducting a collaborative pilot project leveraging Consortium resources. The impact of our integrated research and capacity development activities will be establishment of the H2A Consortium as partnered Centers of Excellence on HIV and HCC in East and West Africa.",2020-09-09T12:09:00Z,2025-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-20-001,nofo_RFA-CA-20-001,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,BALTIMORE,MD,UNITED STATES,hamrcs
U54CA254566,"Lung cancer in East Africa and the relationship to HIV-1 infection: epidemiology, molecular characterization and imaging","The molecular epidemiology of lung cancer in Africa is almost completely unknown, yet molecular profiling and institution of targeted therapy is now standardly used to influence care in patients with actionable mutations. HIV- infection is associated with a markedly increased risk of lung cancer, but its association with lung cancer and how it influences disease outcomes is not well studied. The capacity to correctly diagnose lung cancer on radiological images, tissue specimen acquisition, and subsequent histologic confirmation compounds the problem of under and misdiagnosis of lung cancer in Africa, especially with the prevalence and often presumptive clinical diagnosis of tuberculosis infection. In this consortium proposal, we therefore seek to address the above stated problems by 1) establishing national lung cancer diagnostic referral networks in Uganda and Tanzania, which will allow for improved detection of lung cancer and, hence decrease the lung cancer burden; 2) investigating the role of HIV-1 infection on the incidence and outcomes of lung cancer in the region; 3) determining the molecular profile of lung cancer in East African countries in order to facilitate advocacy for scale- up of targeted therapies (including immune-based therapies); 4) building capacity for lung cancer diagnosis and care in terms of improving imaging, pathology, radiology and tissue acquisition and clinical care of lung cancer 5) creating a lung cancer research collaboration that will build capacity through mentoring of junior researchers for future leadership in the field. At the end of this project, we envision an African-led lung cancer research network, clinical expertise for sample acquisition and care, improved pathology and radiology diagnostics services, a lung cancer screening program, and a large biorepository that should support lung cancer research in the region for many years to come.",2020-09-21T12:09:00Z,2025-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-20-001,nofo_RFA-CA-20-001,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,CLEVELAND,OH,UNITED STATES,hamrcs
U54CA254568,Einstein/Rwanda/DRC Consortium for Research in HIV/HPV/Malignancies,"As millions of Africans living with HIV (LWH) live longer due to effective antiretroviral therapy (ART), their incidence of diseases of aging, including cancer, is increasing. Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the causal agent for almost all cervical and anal cancers, and ~50% of head and neck cancers. Cervical cancer, an AlDS- defining malignancy, is a leading cause of cancer deaths in women worldwide. The transforming capability of HPV is enhanced in women LWH (WLWH), whose HPV-related cervical lesions are more prevalent, more likely to progress, and more likely to become cancer. HPV also causes transformation of the anal mucosa. Men who have sex with men (MSM) constitute a substantial proportion of persons living with HIV (PLWH) around the world, and the incidence of HPV-related anal cancer is growing among MSM living with HIV. The incidence of cervical and anal cancers has not declined with the introduction of ART and remains elevated several fold in women and men LWH. We propose to establish an HIV-Associated HPV-related Malignancies Research Center (HAMRC) in Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), a partnership of four institutions: Albert Einstein College of Medicine, the University of Rwanda (UR), Rwanda Military Hospital (major teaching hospital for UR), and Université Protestante au Congo (UPC), to investigate HIV/HPV related cancers in Africa. This is an extension of our current U54-funded Rwanda/Einstein Research Consortium for HIV/HPV Malignancies, which has been highly successful in performing high-value rigorous research and developing laboratory and investigator research capacity. We will build upon and strengthen our existing partnerships to create a dynamic, integrated and flexible platform with academic, clinical and administrative expertise to support and foster the growth of scientific knowledge in HPV-related cancers in PLWH. We propose two research projects to be conducted over five years that can quickly impact the prevention of HIV/HPV cancers by supporting evidence-based decision-making to improve health outcomes: 1.) population based effectiveness of HPV vaccination in Rwandan women; and 2.) HPV prevalence and disease burden in men who have sex with men (MSM) in DRC and Rwanda. Embedded in both of these projects will be studies of the interaction of the local microbial flora with cervicovaginal, anal, and penile HPV infection. We propose to support both projects by developing laboratory capacity in molecular diagnostics in DRC, and in next generation sequencing (NGS) in Rwanda. Leadership will be provided by a team of four multiple principal investigators (MPIs): Kathryn Anastos MD, Leon Mutesa MD PhD, Marcel Yotebieng MD PhD, and Philip Castle PhD MPH, bringing strong experience in each or our three countries, Rwanda, DRC and the United States. Our Center, a collaboration of US, Rwandan and DRC institutions will serve as a national and regional resource hub in research, training, and career development for African scientific leaders in HIV/HPV-related cancers.",2020-09-21T12:09:00Z,2025-05-31T12:05:00Z,RFA-CA-20-001,nofo_RFA-CA-20-001,ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,BRONX,NY,UNITED STATES,hamrcs
U54CA254569,Pediatric HIV/AIDS & Infection-Related Malignancies Research Consortium for sub-Saharan Africa (PARCA),"Pediatric HIV/AIDS & Infection-Related Malignancies Research Consortium for Sub-Saharan Africa (PARCA) The goal of this proposal is to establish PARCA, a collaborative clinical and translational research framework designed with the overarching goal to improve the current unacceptably poor outcomes of children with HIV- associated malignancies in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Currently, over 80% of children with cancer in the US survive, whereas over 80% in the majority of SSA countries die. To begin to address this disparity and improve outcomes for children with cancer in SSA, Texas Children's Hospital leveraged the clinical infrastructure of BIPAI in Uganda, Malawi, and Botswana to establish Global HOPE (Hematology-Oncology Pediatric Excellence). Global HOPE is dedicated to excellence in the care and treatment of children globally with cancer and blood disorders through state-of-the-art treatments and cutting-edge research. These three Global HOPE pediatric cancer programs, which treat patients nationwide, have begun to transform cancer care in SSA. In the US, improvements in pediatric cancer survival were achieved largely through clinical and translational research coordinated by cooperative groups such as the Children's Oncology Group. Following that model, we propose to establish a framework for collaboration to enable advances for children in SSA living with HIV and diagnosed with cancer through PARCA. The Overarching Goals of the Consortium are to: 1. Define the descriptive epidemiology and infectious exposures related to pediatric malignancies in SSA. We will determine the incidence and outcomes of HIV-associated malignancy across the BIPAI network in SSA. 2. Conduct transformative inter-disciplinary collaborative research to reduce the burden of KS and lymphoma among children and adolescents in SSA. We will establish multi-center strategies for diagnosis, risk- stratification, and outcomes improvement for children with Kaposi sarcoma and lymphoma. These studies will be best conducted in Uganda, Malawi, and Botswana, where the pediatric patient population is large enough to establish meaningful results and conclusions. Validated results will be disseminated throughout our Global HOPE network, as it continues to expand operations in SSA. 3. Support the formation of a multi-national collaborative resource in clinical and translational research, training, and career development for African scientific leaders in HIV and pediatric cancer. We will provide myriad research and training opportunities for pediatric oncologists throughout SSA to participate in and lead translational and clinical research. This program of scientific training will complement and supplement the continued success of Global HOPE Paediatric Haematology and Oncology Fellowship Program.",2020-07-25T12:07:00Z,2025-06-30T12:06:00Z,RFA-CA-20-001,nofo_RFA-CA-20-001,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,HOUSTON,TX,UNITED STATES,hamrcs
U54CA254571,"United States-East Africa HIV-Associated Malignancy Research Center (USEAHAMRC) for Career Development and the Prevention, Early Detection and Efficient Linkage to Care for Virus-related Cancers","In the field of HIV-associated malignancies, East Africa faces three intersecting problems common to resource-limited settings. First, East Africa lacks effective primary and secondary prevention strategies for cervical cancer and Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS), two of the most common cancers not only among HIV-infected persons but in the general population. Survival for both malignancies is poor due to multiple factors including lack of screening, advanced disease stage at presentation, suboptimal diagnostic tests and fragile linkage to care. Second, there is a paucity of local principal investigators to lead research related to HIV- associated cancer. Third, there are no robust research networks to study primary and secondary prevention of HIV-associated cancers in the region. To address this, eight institutions in the U.S. and East Africa will: Aim 1. Create a collaborative network of U.S.-based and East African-based scientists and institutions — the United States-East Africa HIV-Associated Malignancy Research Center (USEAHAMRC) — focused on career development and the performance of research related to prevention, early detection and efficient linkage to care for virus-related cancers; Aim 2. Support the career development of emerging African principal investigators, U.S.-based junior investigators and others in the USEAHAMRC in the performance of HIV and other virus- related cancer research; and Aim 3. Conduct novel research — led by our emerging African principal investigators — related to the prevention, early detection and efficient linkage to care for virus-related cancers. The USEAHAMRC will build on prior work in U54 CA190153 to create a network of scientists from 4 U.S. institutions (UCSF, Duke, Massachusetts General Hospital, and the National Library of Medicine) and 4 African institutions in 3 East African countries (Infectious Diseases Institute in Uganda; Moi University in Kenya; Kenya Medical Research Institute; and Muhimbili University in Tanzania) (Aim 1). We will model our career development activities after NIH-sponsored institutional mentored career development programs (Aim 2). Managed by a Developmental Core, these activities will include professional enrichment to all interested junior scientists at our participating institutions, mentoring of a select group of African and U.S.- based junior scientists to compete for career development awards, and a Pilot Project program to attract new junior scientists. Our African junior investigators will also lead two research projects (Aim 3): Project 1, A Public Health Approach to Cervical Cancer Prevention in East Africa; and Project 2, Rapid Case Ascertainment as a Tool for Epidemiologic Investigation and Efficient Linkage to Care in HIV-infected Patients Diagnosed with Kaposi Sarcoma in East Africa.

U54CA268069,Center for Multiparametric Imaging of Tumor Immune Microenvironments,"This project proposes an integrated suite of microscopy and data analysis advances that would enable quantitative, mechanistic analysis of immune-microenvironment dynamics in poor prognosis solid tumors. While immunotherapies are showing remarkable clinical responses in some advanced cancers, to date, their impact on many solid tumors has been modest. This is due, in part, to solid tumor microenvironments limiting the effectiveness of natural immune responses and immunotherapies. Yet, our understanding of the physical and molecular mechanisms governing T cell infiltration, distribution, and function in native tumor microenvironments remains extremely limited. As such, defining key T cell behaviors as a function of complex tumor microenvironments will identify design criteria that can be used to develop novel cell engineering strategies that optimize T cell-centric therapies for solid tumors. To this end the research theme of the U54 Center for Multiparametric Imaging of Tumor Immune Microenvironments (C-MITIE) is to define physical and molecular barriers to effective anti-tumor immunity and immunotherapies through advancement and development of state-of-the-art live cell and tissue optical imaging platforms and quantitative analyses. To achieve our goals, our framework brings together advanced optical imaging platforms, nano- and micro- fabrication, genome engineering, cancer immunology, and biophysical modeling. Thus, from this integrated effort we seek to define mechanisms of immune suppression that guide the development of next-generation cell-based immunotherapies.",2021-12-09T12:12:00Z,2026-11-30T12:11:00Z,RFA-CA-21-002,nofo_RFA-CA-21-002,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,MINNEAPOLIS,MN,UNITED STATES,ccbir
U54CA268072,Imaging mechanisms of metastatic tumor formation in situ,"Project Summary In response to the RFA for a Cellular Cancer Biology Imaging Program we propose a program focused on imaging and molecularly probing the cell biological events that drive the formation of new metastatic tumors. Specifically, we will address two questions: 1) How does the intersection of shifts in cell-intrinsic and cell- extrinsic signals associated with shifts in expression of the membrane adaptor protein Caveolin-1 affect the metastatic propensity of pediatric sarcoma (Research Testbed Unit 1)? 2) What are the effects of cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic variation in lipid metabolism on melanoma metastasis patterns (Research Testbed Unit 2)? Answers to both questions depend on technology to capture the molecular, metabolic, and morphological states of individual metastatic cells as they colonize the distant site: In the Technology Development Unit-1 we will develop a multi-modal, multi-scale live imaging platform to investigate the effects of intersecting microenvironmental variation across an organism and cell intrinsic heterogeneity on metastatic spreading. The platform will leverage the exquisite optical and physiological properties of the zebrafish embryos to ‘watch’ at once how cells form human tumor xenografts spread to multiple distant sites where they form metastatic tumors. The microscope will allow seamless switching between a high-throughput screening mode observing the metastatic patterns in tens to hundreds of embryos in one experiment and a high-resolution imaging mode with fully isotropic resolution of 300 nm in XYZ that allows detailed analysis of the molecular, metabolic, morphologic, and proliferation/survival states of individual cells within an emerging metastatic niche. In the Technology Development Unit-2 we will develop a multi-scale imaging platform to investigate by hyper-spectral analysis the molecular, metabolic, morphological, and functional states of metastatic cells across entire mouse organs. The platform will leverage advances in tissue clearing, fully automated high-speed and high-resolution light-sheet fluorescence imaging, and computer vision, to integrate a mesoscopic imaging mode for fast acquisition of volumes of up to 20 x 20 x 20 mm at a ~5-10 micron isotropic resolution with a nanoscopic imaging mode providing 300 nm XYZ-resolution throughout a 300 micron field of view anywhere in the organ. Biological features can thus be rapidly identified and immediately interrogated with high subcellular resolution. We will then develop physically and chemically accelerated 60-plex cyclic immunofluorescence assays to comprehensively characterize the molecular, metabolic and architectural states of colonizing cells and their surroundings in the metastatic niche in thick (~200 microns) tissue sections. To accurately describe metastatic heterogeneity, the entire system, including sample handling, labeling, and imaging, will be fully automated and operated in a high-throughput fashion. Our goal with this system is to enable comprehensive profiling of heterogeneous cell metastatic cell behavior in 100’s of intact tissue specimens. Together, these platforms will generate versatile imaging tools for a new era of in situ cancer cell biology.",2021-09-24T12:09:00Z,2026-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-21-002,nofo_RFA-CA-21-002,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,DALLAS,TX,UNITED STATES,ccbir
U54CA268083,Center for 3D Imaging in Cancer Cell Biology,"Project Summary - Overall The mortality rates of breast and pancreatic cancers are intrinsically tied to metastasis. In pancreatic cancer, the 5-year survival rate is only 9% and in ~70% pathological evaluations of the resected tumor, instances of venous invasion are found. Metastasis is a complex multi-step process involving cancer cells, local vasculature, and the surrounding microenvironment at multiple sites. Venous invasion in pancreatic cancer, in which cancer cells gain often invade the portal vein, is an early step in this process and provides the cells a direct path to the liver, the most common site of pancreatic cancer metastasis. As in pancreatic cancer, invasion past normal breast tissue barriers is critically tied to breast cancer outcomes. Most breast tumors can be surgically removed, and so mortality is closely tied to the extent of distant metastasis through lymphovascular invasion. The detection of lymphovascular invasion in a breast tumor correlates with poor prognosis and is not captured in current molecular analyses. The spatial organization of cancer cells, and cellular and stromal components of the tumor microenvironment near and far away from blood vessels is intrinsically three-dimensional, non-symmetric, and highly heterogeneous. In the TECH units of the Johns Hopkins Center for 3D Multiscale Cancer Imaging, we will develop a versatile 3D multiscale imaging method, CODA, which will allow us to probe the phenotypic heterogeneity of tumors from the multi-cm to the micron scale via multiplexing serial imaging. CODA can readily incorporate other imaging modalities to extract high cellular/molecular content from 3D samples. These include immunocytochemistry (CODA+IHC), immunofluorescence (CODA+IF), imaging mass cytometry (CODA+IMC) and spatial transcriptomics/proteomics (CODA+DBiT-seq). These proposed expanded versions of CODA offer a unique opportunity to produce new 3D multi-omic maps of human PDAC and breast tumors near and far from blood vessels. CODA and its integrated versions CODA+X will be tested in the RTB units of the Center in both human/mouse tissue samples and organoids, in breast and pancreatic cancer. Results from these test beds will provide novel mechanistic insights into venous invasion in breast and pancreatic cancer. Exploiting our extensive experience in data dissemination, we will make the large datasets and software produced by our CODA+X platforms and software widely available to the larger cancer research community. The units of the Center will be co-led by Johns Hopkins/Yale engineers, scientists and physicians. Substantial additional support will be provided by the Johns Hopkins U., the JH School of Medicine, the Institute for Convergence, the Department of Pathology, and the Whiting School of Engineering.",2021-12-01T12:12:00Z,2026-11-30T12:11:00Z,RFA-CA-21-002,nofo_RFA-CA-21-002,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,BALTIMORE,MD,UNITED STATES,ccbir
U54CA268084,Northwestern University Center for Chromatin NanoImaging in Cancer (NU-CCNIC),"Overall: PROJECT SUMMARY Cancer stem cells (CSCs) play a critical role in fostering tumor resistance to therapies and relapse after treatment. This presents a crucial barrier to the development of successful anti-cancer therapeutics. Transcriptional reprogramming and plasticity play a critical role in and out of the CSC state, which in turn are interdependent on the regulatory function of the three-dimensional (3D) structure of chromatin, epigenetic states, and other molecular events. Our understanding of fundamental CSC biology has been hampered by the need for cellular nanoscale imaging technologies that provide both highly detailed structural information regarding 3D chromatin organization and highly multiplexed molecular imaging of the many molecular regulators and events involved in CSC processes. We propose to establish the Northwestern University Center for Chromatin Nanoimaging in Cancer (NU-CCNIC) to address this fundamental technology gap in cellular nanoscale imaging and deploy the new technologies to address the fundamental knowledge gap in CSC biology. The Center converges experts in cellular nanoscale imaging, computational imaging, molecular modeling, computational genomics, CSC biology, and oncology. The Center will develop, test, validate, iterate, and deploy an integrated and co-registered Multi-scale Chromatin Nanoimaging Platform that will comprise three “nested-doll” imaging techniques: chromatin scanning transmission electron microscopy, optical spectroscopic super-resolution nanoscopy, and optical spectroscopic nanosensing. The Nanoimaging Platform will enable quantitative imaging of chromatin structure and highly multiplexed molecular and gene-specific localization, at the most fundamental length-scale approaching 1 nm resolution, including the imaging of statistically significant cell populations and live cells with high temporal resolution over prolonged temporal follow-up times. The Nanoimaging Platform will be bridged to computational genomics, epigenomics, genome mapping, and predictive transcriptional modeling datasets. These technologies will be deployed to answer several long-standing open questions in CSC biology. We will elucidate whether CSCs can originate from non-CSCs via transcriptional reprogramming, test the role of chromatin structure in fostering transcriptional plasticity in CSC processes, and explore the possibility of transcriptionally reprogramming CSCs to exit the stem-state as a new therapeutic strategy. All aspects of the technology development will be guided by the needs of the CSC biology testbed through a series of research feedback loops. In the long term, such single-cell nanoimaging technologies will help comprehensive understanding of the complex interplay between structural, physico-chemical, and molecular genomic events. We anticipate that these convergence studies will provide new insights into CSC biology, which are impossible to reveal with the use of any single method, and open new opportunities for identifying therapeutic strategies.",2021-12-10T12:12:00Z,2026-11-30T12:11:00Z,RFA-CA-21-002,nofo_RFA-CA-21-002,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,Chicago,IL,UNITED STATES,ccbir
U54CA272686,Cancer Prevention-Interception Targeted Agent Discovery Program at Fox Chase Cancer Center,"PROJECT SUMMARY - OVERALL Hereditable cancer-predisposing mutations are estimated to be an underlying cause of more than 100,000 adult cancers in the US each year. For many hereditary cancer syndromes, the life-time risk of developing cancer approaches 100%. Despite revolutionary advances in “omics” technologies, our understanding of the molecular alterations required to support the establishment of precancerous lesions and promote early tumor development remains very limited, thus hindering the development of efficacious interventions. A multidisciplinary team of accomplished investigators at Fox Chase Cancer Center (FCCC), with combined expertise in cancer prevention, heritable cancer risk, cancer biology, molecular modeling, and drug discovery has been assembled to address this unmet in an unprecedented way. The goal of the FCCC CAP-IT Center is to effectively coordinate the development of efficacious molecularly-targeted agents for precision cancer prevention and early interception in populations at high risk for cancer. All studies are facilitated by the unique resources of the FCCC Risk Assessment Program, which includes over 12,000 families at high risk for cancer and 2000 confirmed germline mutation carriers. A comprehensive pipeline for the development of agents for cancer prevention and interception is proposed that consists of three well-developed research domains: target validation (Aim 1), agent identification and screening (Aim 2), and pilot in vivo efficacy studies (Aim 3). Each domain will be led by a FCCC investigator, who is a national leader in the respective field. Two highly innovative projects are proposed that illustrate the robustness of the CAP-IT framework. Project 1 (entering at Target Validation) focuses on the development of a newly-identified agent that refolds mutant p53. Its ability to target the TP53 mutations associated with Li- Fraumeni Syndrome and inhibit precancerous lesions in a setting of mutant p53 will be evaluated. Project 2 (entering at Agent Identification and Screening) uniquely targets the initiated pancreatic stroma as a strategy for early interception in the formation of pancreatic cancer. A neutralizing antibody against the stromal protein Netrin G1, that can revert fibroblasts to a tumor-suppressive phenotype, has been discovered. Antibodies with improved potency will be identified and tested in vivo for their ability to intercept the progression of pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia. All CAP-IT research and training will be strongly supported by the Leadership Team and coordinating activities of the Administrative Core, led by Dr. Clapper. Expertise in biostatistics, bioinformatics, and data management will be provided to CAP-IT investigators by an Informatics Core, led by Dr. Ross. Collaborations among the NCI, FCCC and other CAP-IT Centers, as well as the sharing of data and resources through the Data and Resource Coordination Center, will foster productivity and integration across the CAP-IT Network (Aim 4). The long legacy of FCCC in clinical risk assessment and preclinical preventive agent development, when combined with extensive expertise in drug design and cancer biology, makes this Center uniquely poised to be instrumental in the discovery of molecularly-targeted agents to prevent or intercept early oncogenesis.",2022-09-01T12:09:00Z,2027-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-21-038,nofo_RFA-CA-21-038,RESEARCH INST OF FOX CHASE CAN CTR,PHILADELPHIA,PA,UNITED STATES,cap_it

U54CA272691,Cancer Prevention-Interception Against MGUS Progression,"Project Summary Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) is a precancerous condition in which a person has moderately elevated levels of an abnormal immunoglobulin (Ig) protein (called M protein) in the blood. MGUS patients have a cancer risk ~6.5 times as high as the control population. MGUS may progress to multiple myeloma (MM), Waldenström macroglobulinemia (WM), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), amyloid light-chain (AL) amyloidosis, or plasmacytoma. MM, WM, a large portion of NHL, and AL amyloidosis are incurable diseases. CLL and plasmacytoma are rarely cured. The significance of MGUS calls for a cancer prevention-interception U54 Specialized Center dedicated to this precancerous condition  MGUS affects ~1% of the population, MGUS progresses to cancer or other associated blood disorders persistently at a rate of ~1% per year, and ~90% cancer/disorder that progressed from MGUS are incurable. All patients with MGUS are potential candidates for cancer prevention and interception. We hypothesize that cancer-driving molecules and the bone marrow microenvironment promoting MGUS progression are suitable targets for precision cancer prevention and interception. We propose to establish the Cancer Prevention-Interception against MGUS Progression to Cancer (CAP-MGUS) Center as an agile and effective network infrastructure dedicated to preventing MGUS progression. This Center will undertake collaborative research focusing on immunologically and chemically targeted agents that prevent or intercept the oncogenic process in patients with MGUS or smoldering diseases. We propose three aims to achieve the CAP-MGUS Center’s overarching goal. In Aim 1, we will functionally validate several oncotargets in tumor initiation and progression to invasive cancer and ascertain their suitability for targeted intervention strategies. In Aim 2, we will discover innovative immuno- and chemo-prevention and interception agents through in vitro and in vivo efficacy evaluation. In Aim 3, we will develop new projects by identifying novel targets for cancer- preventive or interceptive interventions against MGUS progression. Collectively, we expect to obtain chemoprevention and immunoprevention agents for further development or earlier phase clinical trials.",2023-09-01T12:09:00Z,2027-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-22-055,nofo_RFA-CA-22-055,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,HOUSTON,TX,UNITED STATES,cap_it
U54CA274220,Acquired Resistance to Therapy and Iron (ARTI) Center,"Overall Summary Approximately 50% of cancer patients are treated with radiation therapy (RT), but local recurrence can still occur even with the use of advanced RT techniques. This local recurrence, which commonly develops in 30-50% of cancer cases, is exacerbated by the acquisition of RT resistance. This RT resistance is especially true for patients with locally advanced thoracic cancers, such as lung and esophageal cancers. RT can lead to an iron- dependent cell death modality, called ferroptosis, but whether ferroptosis resistance occurs within tumors giving rise to acquired RT resistance is not known and is the central theme of the proposed Acquired Resistance to Therapy and Iron (ARTI) Center. The overarching goals of the ARTI Center are: 1) to bridge the basic science mechanisms of ferroptosis in acquired resistance with translational research in preclinical models and human patient samples; 2) to identify cohorts of patients who are at greatest risk to develop acquired RT resistance; and 3) to investigate the ability of novel therapeutic agents to re-sensitize lung and esophageal cancer cells to radiation by inducing ferroptosis. The ARTI Center comprises two basic/mechanistic projects (Project 1 and Project 2), one preclinical/translational project (Project 3), and one shared resource core (Molecular Imaging Core [MIC]). Project 1 will focus on elucidating whether ferroptosis evasion is a key driver in acquired RT resistance using radioresistant lung cancer and esophageal cancer cell lines and xenograft models that will be used in Project 2. Project 2 will test the hypothesis that hypoxia, a long-recognized driver of tumor radioresistance, suppresses ferroptosis induction during RT and contributes to RT-induced acquired resistance to ferroptosis. Furthermore, expression of hypoxia-related genes and other targets of acquired RT resistance will be analyzed by single-cell sequencing in Project 3. Project 3 investigates changes in immune cells in the tumor microenvironment of humanized tumor models derived from chemoradiation therapy-responsive or -non- responsive esophageal adenocarcinoma patients. These ferroptosis-mediated immunologic changes in the tumor microenvironment may serve as prognostic biomarkers for identifying tumors that may acquire RT resistance and predicting cancer patient outcomes, which could, in the future, be modulated by the ferroptosis- inducing agents tested in Projects 1 and 2. Projects 1, 2, and 3 will be supported by the MIC that utilizes bioluminescence imaging to monitor tumor growth, positron emission tomography (PET) tracers to monitor cystine transporter activity and to identify hypoxic regions within tumors, as well as novel, redox-tuned PET tracers for identifying activated innate immune cells. The ARTI Center will develop an Administrative Core for effective communication and collaboration between the ARTI Center Project and Core Leaders and Co-Leaders with National Cancer Institute (NCI) of Acquired Resistance to Therapy Network (ARTNet) program staff as well as other ARTNet centers to synergize ARTI Center-related activities.",2022-09-20T12:09:00Z,2027-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-21-052,nofo_RFA-CA-21-052,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,HOUSTON,TX,UNITED STATES,artnet
U54CA274321,The Houston Center for Acquired Resistance Research (H-CARR),"Overall SUMMARY Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) remains a leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide with ~500,000 cases/year. Cisplatin is the gold standard systemic agent for HNSCC. Cisplatin resistance, both intrinsic and acquired, has been described in preclinical models and is frequently encountered in clinical practice; when it occurs it is deadly. The overarching goal of H-CARR is to develop a robust biological understanding of the key drivers of cisplatin resistance in HNSCC and develop the means of detecting it early in development and overcoming it once it arises. We previously showed that: 1) cellular processing of cisplatin generated metabolic stress is a critical driver of sensitivity and/or resistance and 2) coordinated genomic (TP53 mutation) and transcriptomic (Nrf-2 activation) reprogramming is essential to organizing the metabolic response to cisplatin generated stress. H-CARR brings together our biological and metabolic models of cisplatin resistance and our translational capabilities to image tumor metabolism non-invasively and detect biological shifts using circulating tumor cells (CTCs), to provide a comprehensive window into acquisition of cisplatin resistance as outlined in the Projects listed below, supported by a robust administrative and analytical infrastructure organized into 3 Cores. Project 1 will use state of the art metabolomic studies to identify the critical metabolic dependencies of cisplatin resistant HNSCC, identify opportunities for effective metabolic inhibition and improve our understanding of the cross-talk between the acquisition of cisplatin resistance and modulation of the tumor immune microenvironment. Project 2 will explore the genomic and transcriptomic reprogramming required to sustain the metabolic shifts which accompany development of resistance and interrogate how Nrf-2 dependent and independent signaling drives resistance and enhanced distant metastasis through intrinsic cellular mechanisms and paracrine signaling between tumor cells and adrenergic neurons. Project 3 will test whether the metabolic reprogramming outlined in Project 1 is detectable via non-invasive imaging (hyperpolarized magnetic resonance imaging) and whether the biological shifts outlined in Project 2 due to clonal extinction and expansion can be detected using CTC analysis in patients undergoing cisplatin-based treatment. H-CARR has the potential to realize the full clinical utility of cisplatin by identifying acquisition of resistance early during treatment and developing the means to overcome this and associated phenotypes such as enhanced distant metastasis. Successful completion of the proposed experiments will generate the new clinical standard for precision oncology approaches to clinical utilization of cisplatin in HNSCC and related upper- aerodigestive tract cancers of the lung and esophagus and therefore have a major impact on cancer survival worldwide.",2022-09-20T12:09:00Z,2027-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-21-052,nofo_RFA-CA-21-052,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,HOUSTON,TX,UNITED STATES,artnet
U54CA274329,Pancreatic Cancer ARTNet Center,"Abstract Pancreatic cancer patients show an extremely poor prognosis, which is at least in part due to poor response to the current standard-of-care chemotherapies. While pancreatic tumors present an inadequate response to chemotherapy, exposure to chemotherapy leads to development of acquired resistance. The response and resistance to chemotherapies are modulated by signaling and metabolic alterations in tumor cells and companion changes in the immune and non-immune stroma. Major advances in (a) understanding signaling responses of cancer cells and stroma to therapy, (b) understanding metabolic adaptations to signaling and environmental stressors, (c) development of novel therapeutic combinations to improve long-term response to current standards-of-care chemotherapies, and (d) coordinating research/translation efforts by NCI leadership, will provide unparalleled advances in targeting/preventing acquired therapy resistance. The ARTNet Center for Pancreatic Cancer (ACPC) intends to achieve these objectives through an integrated research theme that combined investigations into the metabolic and signaling mediators of acquired resistance in tumor cells and stromal remodeling in pancreatic cancer will lead to novel effective therapies to improve the patient prognosis. Research within ACPC will be fostered through sound guidance from leadership, IAC, EAC, ARTNet network and NCI program. The overall goal of the Center is to study innovative hypothesis-driven mechanisms of metabolic and signaling alterations in tumor cells and tumor-stromal metabolic crosstalk that contribute to acquired therapy resistance in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). We hypothesize that our unique leadership team, outstanding expertise of project and core leaders, singular set of technological capabilities and resources, operational design, and strong institutional support of the ACPC will drive transformative advances in the acquired therapy resistance field that will be in alignment with the other ARTNet members and NCI’s mission for the program. Providing novel insights into the mechanistic aspects of the signaling and metabolic mechanisms, the proposed basic and translational studies will ultimately drive the development of novel therapeutic combinations that can change the clinical course of cancer therapy. This will be achieved through the following Specific Aims: Aim 1. Investigate novel mechanisms of acquired resistance at the interface of tumor- stromal metabolic cross talk and examine the preclinical efficacy of identified targets to improve the therapeutic response against pancreatic cancer. Aim 2. Provide robust and innovative toolsets and resources to investigate and validated mechanisms of acquired therapy resistance. Aim 3. Facilitate a systems-level mechanistic understanding of acquired therapy resistance mechanisms.",2022-09-20T12:09:00Z,2027-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-21-052,nofo_RFA-CA-21-052,UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA HLTH SCIENCES CTR,OKLAHOMA CITY,OK,UNITED STATES,artnet
U54CA274367,Shaping of the Microenvironment in Colonic Pre-Cancer by Epithelia and Microbiota,"The Vanderbilt TBEL Center assembles a multi-disciplinary team of field-specific experts to collaboratively investigate the basic and translational pathways of colonic pre-cancer progression. Our foundational work on two subtypes of colonic pre-cancers, adenomas (ADs) and sessile serrated lesions (SSLs), depicts the early origins of tumorigenesis that are shaped by modulation of the immune microenvironment via neoplastic cells and the microbiota. We have shown that SSLs originate from gastric metaplasia arising from the mucosal surface in a cytotoxic immune microenvironment, whereas ADs arise from stem cell-derived WNT activation at the crypt base. In this center, we will extend our investigation of specific biological mechanisms towards the developmental trajectories of these pre-malignant lesions into progression or indolence. Basic Project 1 investigates the contribution of neutrophil-AD crosstalk, largely via dipeptidase 1 (DPEP1) both at the cell surface and released in small extracellular vesicles, in the course of AD progression. Translational Project 2 investigates, in human prospective studies, the association of pks+ Escherichia coli that induces genotoxic stress with pre-cancer progression, as well as colon epithelial cell and mucosa mechanisms that may contribute to a polyp-promoting microenvironment. Basic Project 3 investigates acquisition of stemness in modulating antigen presentation to cytotoxic T cells in the context of co-evolution between neoplastic cells and the immune system. Joint analysis of common colorectal pre-cancer tissues will facilitate an ongoing process of iteration and integration across all projects. Our TBEL Center offers a complementary blend, from reductionist and systems biology approaches, to investigate critical factors involved in the progression of pre-cancerous tumors of the colon to CRC. The work will utilize cutting-edge technologies on human tissues, including single-cell and spatial transcriptomics, small extracellular vesicle profiling, multiplex imaging, longitudinal data analysis, and next-generation computational algorithms. In addition, substantial human polyp resources previously established by the Vanderbilt GI Specialized Programs of Research Excellence and the NCI Moonshot Human Tumor Atlas Network will be leveraged by the same team of investigators in the TBEL Center. In addition, an innovative co-culture system will be employed by each project, where polarizing pre-cancer organoids can be co-cultured with key microenvironment elements exposed to neoplastic cells from the luminal or basal side. This work will inform the modeling of tumor development trajectories and identify mechanisms of progression that will enable improvements in risk stratification, precision prevention, and interception for individuals with colorectal pre- cancers.",2022-09-15T12:09:00Z,2027-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-21-054,nofo_CA21-054,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,NASHVILLE,TN,UNITED STATES,tbel
U54CA274370,Prostate inflammatory lesions as a proving ground for development of aggressive prostate cancer,"Project Summary: Epidemiological and pathological studies have implicated lifestyle, microbial, and environmental factors in prostate cancer etiology/risk. A potential link between these factors and prostate carcinogenesis is the presence of chronic inflammation associated with atrophy (PIA) in prostates of aging men. Yet, there is a paradox surrounding the role of the immune response in prostate cancer: “the inflammation paradox”. On one hand, inflammation may be a driver of carcinogenesis. On the other, the immune system is known to seek and destroy cancer cells. The majority prostate cancer lesions are “immune deserts”, and ICIs are ineffective in most cases. Why is there an evidently strong immune reaction in non- neoplastic regions in PIA, but a lack of a robust immune response in most prostate cancers? We hypothesize that chronic inflammation in PIA represents evidence of an innate immune response that drives carcinogenesis. However, in this inflammatory “proving ground”, only cells that can epigenetically switch off this response can emerge to become aggressive neoplastic precursors. We hypothesize that the paucity of immune infiltrates and lack of PD-L1, is evidence that prostate cancer cells develop a number of different mechanisms that evade anti-tumor adaptive immunity. We postulate that additional cell non- autonomous immune suppressive mechanisms enable disease progression. We propose 3 synergistic Research Projects (2 basic,1 translational) to mechanistically test key questions stemming from our “proving ground” hypothesis. In Proj 1 (Basic Science) we hypothesize that the STING induction in PIA drives acute and chronic inflammation, leading to cell injury/cell death and proliferation. Second, in a subset of PIA cells, epigenetic silencing of STING dampens of the immune response, allowing them to emerge as overt pre- neoplastic cells. We will test this in animal models and in translational studies employing annotated and molecularly characterized prostatectomies. The combination of PTEN loss and MYC copy number gain is an independent predictor of poor outcome in prostate cancer. We hypothesize that the combination of MYC and PTEN stimulates a cell non-autonomous immune evasion mechanism induced by the recruitment of immuno- suppressive myeloid cells, and fibroblast activation protein (FAP)-positive fibroblasts. Proj 2 (Basic Science) will test these hypotheses in animal models and in human tissues. Recently introduced imaging technologies have raised the hypothesis that PET/CT imaging results may be able to predict molecular and tumoral micro- environmental characteristics of aggressive prostate cancer. PET imaging for PSMA using PyL PET/CT has been FDA approved for imaging high risk men prior to prostatectomy. In Proj 3 (Translational) we employ PET/CT scanning for PSMA and combine this with mpMRI to address these hypotheses. Also in Proj 3 we will apply newly developed/developing PET imaging agents to non-invasively and longitudinally study the extent of M2 macrophages and cancer associated fibroblasts in our mouse prostate progression cancer models.",2022-09-15T12:09:00Z,2027-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-21-054,nofo_CA21-054,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,BALTIMORE,MD,UNITED STATES,tbel
U54CA274371,Tumor Microenvironment Crosstalk Drives Early Lesions in Pancreatic Cancer,"OVERALL - ABSTRACT Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the 3rd most common cause of cancer-related mortality in the United States, with the overhwhelming majority of patients presenting advanced stage disease. Invasive neoplasia in the pancreas represents the culmination of a multistep progression that begins with non-invasive precursor lesions, which remain an untapped “window of opportunity” for early detection and cancer interception. Two major histological subtypes of precursor lesions are recognized - the more common non-cystic pathway, represented by pancreatic intarepithelial neoplasia or PanIN lesions, estimated to precede ~90% of PDAC, and the cystic pathway, most commonly represented by intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms or IPMNs, accounting for the remaining 10%. While members of this team have played a seminal role in characterizing the histology and genetics of PanINs and IPMNs, much remains to be elucidated in terms of the molecular dependencies that sustain early pancreatic neoplasia, and how signaling cues from these early lesions reprogram the “precursor microenvironment” (PME), including “precursor-associated fibroblasts” (PAFs). The goal of our Tri-state Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma TBEL (Tri-PACT) Center - incorporating UT MD Anderson Cancer Center (UTMDACC), University of Michigan (UMich) and Johns Hopkins University (JHU) - is to create a collaborative and integrated U54 center to conduct basic and translational studies in early pancreatic neoplasia. The Tri-PACT Center will be led by Dr. Anirban Maitra (UTMDACC) and Co-PI Dr. Marina Pasca di Magliano (UMich). The title of our Tri-PACT Center proposal is “Tumor Microenvironment Crosstalk Drives Early Lesions in Pancreatic Cancer”, and we are proposing three projects (two basic, one translational), each of which will be supported by a Multiscale Computational Oncology Research Core (M-CORE) and an Administrative Core (AC). Project 1 (basic) will study the functional requirement of a pivotal cytokine, interleukin IL-33, which is induced in the PAF and epithelial compartments of PanINs and IPMNs in response to KRAS and GNAS mutations, respectively, in disease progression and reprogramming of the PME. Project 2 (basic) will study a unique metabolic “synthetic essentiality” centered on mitochondrial quality control created in cystic precursors that harbor loss of RNF43, a E3 ubiquitin ligase lost in ~50% of IPMNs. Notably, the Tri-PACT investigators have developed genetically engineered models (GEMs) of pancreatic preneoplasia that recapitulate the cognate human lesions, and will be extensively leveraged in the two basic projects, with cross-species validation in patient-derived preclinical models. Project 3 (translational) will deploy a unique 3D reconstruction tool (CODA) paired with multi-region sequencing of human precursor lesions to map the evolutionary trajectory of individual precursors at an unprecedented resolution, and correlate subclonal architecture with high dimensional analysis of the immune and PAF composition within the PME. Cumulatively, these projects will enhance our understanding of the drivers of early pancreatic neoplasia, and a seedbed for early detection approaches.",2022-09-21T12:09:00Z,2027-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-21-054,nofo_CA21-054,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,HOUSTON,TX,UNITED STATES,tbel
U54CA274374,"Understanding adenoma progression: Interplay among tissue microenvironment, clonal architecture, and gut microbiome","SUMMARY Colorectal cancer (CRC) affects ~145,000 people/year in the US and is the 3rd most common cause of cancer related deaths. CRC arises from early lesions that are pre-cancerous; these early lesions are colon adenomas and serrated sessile lesions (SSL). Colon adenomas account for 80-85% of the CRC precancerous lesions and progress to CRC via an early adenomaàadvanced adenomaàCRC sequence. In light of the well characterized clinical natural history of adenomas, we plan to study them as early lesions and to determine the mechanisms involved in the formation and progression of early precancerous lesions. Notably, only a few early adenomas will progress to advanced adenomas (AA) and even fewer will progress to CRC. Our group and others have shown that mutations alone are not sufficient to cause adenoma initiation and/or progression in the majority of cases. There are likely multiple adenoma nonautonomous mechanisms that cooperate with the DNA alterations in the adenomas to cause progression, and these mechanisms are likely operative in discrete subsets of affected individuals. We and others have observed alterations, such as tissue senescence, high cancer driver gene mutation loads, aberrant DNA methylation patterns, and dysbiotic gut microbiomes, in the normal colon of people with advanced adenomas and CRC patients. We have termed normal colons with these features “primed colons” and propose that these features are plausible mechanisms that affect adenoma initiation and progression. Based on these observations and our prior studies, we hypothesize that early lesion progression requires a suite of hallmark behaviors and that these behaviors are induced by adenoma autonomous factors (e.g. cancer driver gene mutations) and adenoma nonautonomous factors from the “primed colon” or adenoma microenvironment. Our proposed studies will integrate basic and translational cancer research Projects to iteratively examine the direct causal relationships and interactions of adenomas, the colon “primed” microenvironment, and host- systemic factors as “co-organizers” of adenoma initiation and/or progression. The Specific Aims are: Aim 1) To determine the adenoma cell autonomous molecular factors that distinguish nonadvanced adenomas from advanced adenomas and that regulate nonadvanced adenoma progression. (Projects 1 and 2) Aim 2) To determine the adenoma nonautonomous factors from the “primed” colon and from the adenoma microenvironment that associate with advanced human colon adenomas and regulate adenoma progression. These factors will include the following “primed” colon states: 1. senescence state; 2. cancer driver gene mutation burden; 3. gut microbiome state; 4. colon methylome, and 5. colon immune activity state. (Projects 1-3) Aim 3)To determine how adenoma autonomous and nonautonomous factors from the adenoma microenvironment and the “primed” colon cooperate to drive adenoma formation and progression.(Projcts 1-3)",2022-09-20T12:09:00Z,2027-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-21-054,nofo_CA21-054,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER CENTER,Seattle,WA,UNITED STATES,tbel
U54CA274375,The stromal microenvironment as a co-organizer of bladder carcinogenesis  and progression,"OVERALL PROJECT SUMMARY Bladder cancer (BC) is the second most common urologic malignancy affecting 573,278 people worldwide in 2020. Pathologically, BC is diagnosed as non-muscle-invasive (NMI) and muscle-invasive (MI) disease. Here we define early bladder lesions as NMIBC. Major clinical gaps in NMIBC include i) lack of mechanistic insights defining NMIBC progression, and ii) lack of platform for risk stratification of NMIBC that recur but never progress (“non-progressors”), from those that progresses into MIBC (“progressors”) and consequently demonstrate poor prognosis. The goal of our Center is to tackle this clinical issue by deciphering the underlying mechanisms restraining or promoting the progression of early lesions (Project 1 & 2), and to leverage this novel biology as candidate biomarkers to risk-stratify aggressive NMIBC (Project 3). This proposal seeks to shift the current research paradigm in the field of NMIBC, by proposing a conceptually innovative tug-of-war between a tumor- restraining (Project 1) and a tumor-promoting mechanism (Project 2) in determining the outcome of early bladder lesions/NMIBC in becoming “progressors” or “non-progressors” (Project 3). Clinically, why “non-progressors” often recur but seldom progress, and what are the driving forces advancing “progressors” into MIBC with poor survival remain fundamental questions in field. Our tug-of-war hypothesis with two opposing forces is conceptually different to most other studies, which primarily focus on one side of the coin. Further, the integration of knowledge from Project 1 and 2 as a unified spatial proteomics and transcriptomics map by the Shared Resource Core will reveal spatial and temporal relationships between distinct fibroblast populations with opposing functions, their physical interactions with tumor and immune cell clusters, as well as their relationship to the biomarkers from Project 3. Benchmark of success: The knowledge gained here will shift clinical practice paradigm, by informing future NIMBC management through 1) the development of novel urinary profiling strategies that could risk stratify aggressive NMIBC (Project 1-3); 2) the identification of targets for future precision intervention, either by enhancing/sustaining the tumor-restraining mechanisms (Project 1) and/or inhibiting the tumor-promoting mechanisms (Project 2). The overall success of our program is further ensured by an extraordinary multi-investigator team that integrates three “organ-specific” bladder cancer investigators within Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. All have active R01s and individual NCI-funding track record in performing basic science research, translational bladder cancer research, or leading multi-center clinical trials on the discovery and validation of biomarkers. Finally, they propose to collect valuable retrospective and prospective NMIBC cohorts, which are essential to address the clinical questions posed within this proposal and will become available to the research community as a shared resource to advance the field.",2022-09-22T12:09:00Z,2027-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-21-054,nofo_CA21-054,METHODIST HOSPITAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE,HOUSTON,TX,UNITED STATES,tbel
U54CA274492,The Center for Tumor-Immune Systems Biology at MSKCC,"The Center for Tumor-Immune Systems Biology at MSKCC SUMMARY The advent of cancer immunotherapies based on immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has revolutionized clinical care in multiple solid tumor types and demonstrated the power of the immune system to target and eliminate cancer cells. Despite these breakthroughs, the efficacy of ICB-based immunotherapy is limited to a subset of cancers, and even in tumors where ICB is now the standard of care, only a fraction of patients achieve durable complete responses. Addressing these limitations requires (1) improving our fundamental understanding of tumor-immune interactions in immunological contexts where current immunotherapies fail and (2) developing novel strategies for enhancing responses in contexts where they have only partial success. The Center for Tumor-Immune Systems Biology at MSKCC has assembled a multi-disciplinary team of leading investigators in computational biology, immunology, and cancer biology to tackle these challenges. The Center is organized around three Research Projects that integrate computational and experimental studies in mouse models and molecular analyses in patient tumors in both immunotherapy-resistant and -responsive contexts, exploiting novel machine learning modeling of single-cell multiome, highly multiplexed optical imaging using confocal immunofluorescence, and spatial transcriptomic data sets. We will investigate distinct immune microenvironments where cancers are refractory to ICB: metastatic colonization of the brain, an immune- privileged organ where the interplay of cancer cells, astrocytes, and different states of disease-associated microglia dictate modes of invasion (Project I); and mismatch-repair proficient primary colon cancer, where tumors reside in a tolerizing microenvironment and interact with complex cellular circuits of regulatory and conventional T cells, together with metastases to the lymph node and liver (Project II). We will also carry out a systems biology interrogation of cancer cell death mechanisms in models of ICB-responsive melanoma and renal cell carcinoma, based on findings that engineering mitochondrial damage-dependent but caspase- independent cell death elicits anti-cancer immunity and protection against tumor rechallenge (Project III). A Shared Resource Core will interact with all three Research Projects to develop computational methods and establish technologies for spatial analyses of the tumor-immune microenvironment. These studies will advance our fundamental understanding of tumor-immune ecosystems in ICB-refractory microenvironments and of immune responses to therapeutically induced immunogenic cancer cell death in ICB-responsive settings, ultimately leading to novel immunotherapeutic targets and combination strategies. Our team will build on the successes of our previous CSBC U54 Center award for the Center for Cancer Systems Immunology at MSKCC, which produced numerous high-impact studies at the forefront of systems biology and cancer immunology. Our Research Center will also carry out innovative outreach and training activities to disseminate research findings in tumor-immune systems biology and to train young scientists in this critical field.",2022-09-16T12:09:00Z,2027-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-21-048,nofo_RFA-CA-21-048,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,NEW YORK,NY,UNITED STATES,csbc
U54CA274499,Systems Analysis of Stress-adapted Cancer Organelles (SASCO) Center,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Oncogene activation is modulated by normal subcellular compartments that execute specialized functions related to hallmark cancer phenotypes. These organelles must adapt to oncogenic stress in order for tumors to initiate and progress, but there is little to no systems-level understanding of how such adaptations occur and what vulnerabilities might be created. The Systems Analysis of Stress-adapted Cancer Organelles (SASCO) Center at the University of Virginia will address this challenge by mechanistic modeling of organellar processes that iterates with quantitative experiments in disease-relevant cell cultures and primary tumors. The working SASCO Center hypothesis is that organelle-specific adaptation to oncogenic stress occurs through a few critical bottlenecks, which become identifiable once the relevant signaling, metabolic, and transport pathways have been properly integrated. The Center brings together 14 investigators with primary and collaborative track records in cancer biology, systems biology, genetically engineered mouse models of cancer, and clinical practice. Three Research Projects and one Shared Research Core will pursue a common research strategy, which leverages mechanistic models to test competing alternative hypotheses about how organelles adapt to stresses from proximal oncogenes that drive specific types of cancer. The Projects are organized hierarchically as organelle stresses downstream of proliferation-inducing oncogenes. Project 1 will examine the chromosome passenger complex and its regulated phase separation during metaphase as an organelle that senses and repairs spindle defects to suppress breast cancer aneuploidy driven by mitotic transcription factors. Project 2 will evaluate the metabolic consequences of chronic mitochondrial fragmentation caused by mutant KRAS in primary colorectal cancers and secondary liver metastases. Project 3 will investigate localized signal-transduction rebalancing as a mechanism for alleviating plasma-membrane stress caused by EGFR amplification in glioblastoma. All Research Projects will rely on the High-Content Imaging & Analysis Core to obtain iterative multichannel immunofluorescence data with organelle-level resolution and quantification. The SASCO Outreach Core amplifies ongoing programs at the University of Virginia to provide summer research experiences for undergraduates and faculty scholars from historically underrepresented backgrounds as well as introductory systems biology modeling materials for clinicians across the Commonwealth of Virginia. The SASCO Center will thus create a national headquarters for subcellular cancer systems biology within the broader Cancer Systems Biology Consortium.",2022-09-12T12:09:00Z,2027-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-21-048,nofo_RFA-CA-21-048,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,CHARLOTTESVILLE,VA,UNITED STATES,csbc
U54CA274502,The Cancer Cell Map Initiative v2.0,"THE CANCER CELL MAP INITIATIVE v2.0 OVERALL SUMMARY The Cancer Genome Atlas and sister projects have now sequenced over 20,000 tumor genomes, providing a catalog of gene mutations, copy number variants and other genetic alterations associated with cancer. These data have made it clear that every cancer is a distinct genetic disease, with tumors that look physiologically similar often driven by patterns of gene mutations that are strikingly different. Due to this molecular heterogeneity, it is typically unclear what are the key driver mutations or dependencies in a given cancer and how these influence pathogenesis and response to therapy. One key observation for interpreting tumor genomes is that the many rare tumor mutations can be shown to converge on common molecular networks. Based on this premise we created the Cancer Cell Map Initiative (CCMI), whose mission is to create comprehensive maps of cancer molecular networks and to use these maps in intelligent systems for personalized therapy. In 2017, the CCMI was funded as an NCI U54 Research Center for Cancer Systems Biology, integrating expertise in network mapping, bioinformatic analysis and cancer research from leading academic laboratories at two University of California campuses (UCSF and UCSD). We have since generated comprehensive networks of protein interactions in breast and head-and-neck tumor cells and, from these data, identified several hundred protein complexes under selective mutational pressure in cancer (NeST v1.0). We have piloted deep learning systems (DCell, DrugCell and TCRP) that can use this protein network information to translate a patient’s tumor mutation profile to a predicted drug response, including FDA-approved and exploratory agents. We have implemented a rich portfolio of training opportunities and, leveraging UC institutional support, expanded the CCMI consortium to include more than a dozen faculty at UC and, most recently, Stanford. In the next five years, the CCMI will seek to: (1) Generate comprehensive protein interaction networks centered on key cancer driver genes in lung squamous cells (in healthy and diseased states) as well as the PIK3CA and TP53 pathways, which are central to many tumor types; (2) Systematically extend the CCMI collection of cancer protein interaction data with protein immunofluorescent imaging and cryo-electron microscopy to formulate multi-scale cancer cell maps; (3) Dissect the functional logic of these networks and maps by systematic genetic screening experiments in the same tumor types and pathways, using a panel of scalable cell proliferation, phenotype and pathway readouts; (4) Significantly advance and harden our DrugCell interpretable deep learning system for cancer precision medicine; (5) Train the current and next generation of scientists in network biology and its applications to cancer research; and (6) Continue to build a cadre of leading investigators to expand CCMI into a global coordinated partnership.",2022-09-14T12:09:00Z,2027-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-21-048,nofo_RFA-CA-21-048,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",SAN FRANCISCO,CA,UNITED STATES,csbc
U54CA274504,Mathematical Oncology Systems Analysis Imaging Center (MOSAIC),"SUMMARY: OVERALL: MATHEMATICAL ONCOLOGY SYSTEMS ANALYSIS IMAGING CENTER Glioblastoma (GBM), the most aggressive primary brain cancer, is amongst the most heterogeneous of cancers, both intra- and inter-tumorally. GBMs are an admixture of neoplastic glioma cells and non-neoplastic / reactive brain parenchyma that contribute to the overall imageable tumor mass. As such, cellular content, including both cellular density and cellular composition, is critically important for understanding the status and evolution of a given tumor. Although MRI provides excellent soft tissue contrast and can noninvasively characterize anatomy, no methods exist to integrate a spatial and temporal understanding of the cellular components of the tumor inferred from imaging in vivo. It has become increasingly clear that precision oncology strategies rely on a quantitative and predictive understanding of the state of the cancer complex system evolving within each patient. Recent findings from our group have revealed two key opportunities we seek to leverage in our proposed Mathematical Oncology Systems Analysis Imaging Center (MOSAIC). First, molecular analysis of a cohort of our image-localized biopsies of GBM have inspired the concept of Glioma Tissue States as a composite classification of tissue samples. Our findings from single nucleus RNAseq reveal that specific subpopulations and cellular phenotypes of neoplastic and non- neoplastic cells show distinct patterns of co-habitation constraining potential cross-talk signaling. Second, we have found mathematical modeling and machine learning analyses of clinical MRI features of GBM biopsies are able to predict loco-regional features of GBM biology in vivo. These image-based models provide the promise to track aspects of intra- and inter-tumoral heterogeneity previously unattainable during patient care. Our overall center vision is to build a conceptual framework to understand tissue state-associated cellular composition transitions that happen in glioma and the ways to interpret MRI relative to those changes for these key cellular phenotypes. Specifically, in Project 1 we will explore strategies to target unfavorable (unresponsive) tissue states to navigate transitions of the cancer complex system towards more favorable (responsive) tissue states. In Project 2 we will leverage mathematical modeling and machine learning approaches to fuse MRI and image-localized biopsy quantified tissue states to enable tracking tissue state changes in patient receiving standard of care and immunotherapy strategies. Thus, our MOSAIC perfectly aligns with the CSBC initiative, integrating experimental biology with computational modeling, using methods from imaging physics, mathematical tumor growth modeling, image-guided biopsies, molecular biology, machine learning, and integrative bioinformatics to develop validated advances in cancer systems biology.",2023-09-18T12:09:00Z,2028-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-21-048,nofo_RFA-CA-21-048,MAYO CLINIC ARIZONA,SCOTTSDALE,AZ,UNITED STATES,csbc
U54CA274506,Center for Cancer Systems Therapeutics (CaST),"PROJECT SUMMARY Patients with aggressive cancers often present with no pharmacologically actionable mutations and poor or no sensitivity to immune checkpoint blockade, thus deriving only modest improvement in disease-free survival from targeted therapy and immunotherapy. Tumor heterogeneity adds further complexity by fostering reprogramming, adaptation, selection, and ultimately expansion of drug-resistant cells, as well as emergence of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), both of which are ultimately responsible for patient relapse and poor outcome. Addressing these challenges—i.e., identifying more universal, mechanism-based targets for pharmacological intervention and assessing their potential value in highly heterogeneous tumors—is critically dependent on the availability of accurate, comprehensive, and cell type-specific molecular interaction networks (cellular networks, hereafter), which underlie both the cell-autonomous behavior of cancer cells and their interaction with other TME subpopulations. The proposed Cancer Systems Therapeutics (CaST) Center, will continue its highly productive collaboration within the U54 Cancer Systems Biology Center (CSBC) network by extending its successful network-based methodologies—which integrate cutting edge computational advances and novel experimental technologies, including use of 3D structure and multi-omics-based evidence. This will support studying cancer as a fully integrated system of co-evolving, interacting subpopulations, comprising both molecularly distinct, coexisting malignant cell states as well as non-malignant cell states recruited to the tumor microenvironment and potentially reprogrammed to implement a pro-malignant, immunosuppressive milieu. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to leverage recent advances by CaST center investigators to elucidate the Mechanism of Action of clinically relevant drugs and late-stage experimental compounds to target individual subpopulation to either drive combination therapy or to rescue immunotherapy in drug resistant tumors.",2023-09-19T12:09:00Z,2028-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-21-048,nofo_RFA-CA-21-048,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,NEW YORK,NY,UNITED STATES,csbc
U54CA274507,The Delta Ecology of NSCLC Treatment,"Summary – Moffitt CSBC Proposal Overview The Moffitt CSBC proposal is focused on the essential and highly dynamical interplay between cancer cell evolution and the constantly changing ecology of the lung microenvironment. Tumors are not simply collections of mutated cells that grow in isolation. Rather, they respond to and modify both the physical microenvironment and a variety of host cells, and these changes in ecology (“∆-Ecology”) are key to understanding tumor progression and the response to therapy – particularly the development of resistance. Central to this proposal is quantifying, understanding, and actioning the change that occurs during treatment to both the tumor and non-tumor ecology in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which is the most common and among the most lethal of human cancers. We will define the ecological and evolutionary dynamics that govern NSCLC progression and treatment success or failure through 2 projects and 2 shared resource cores. Each project will focus on different D-Ecology dynamics in the presence of different driver mutations (RAS, EGFR, ALK) for which targeted therapy is available. Each project demonstrates our unifying theme of tight empirical/mathematical integration through the sequence of develop, predict, calibrate, test, optimize, and validate. Thus, each project begins with available clinical data followed by in silico (predict and optimize), in vitro (calibrate and test) and in vivo (validate) model systems leading to readily translatable treatment options. The mathematical and ecological Cores incorporate the mathematical and computational methods needed for bridging the projects. The Math Core will serve as the mechanistic model engine of the center, facilitating both spatial and non-spatial models of eco-evolutionary processes to generate and test hypotheses regarding ∆- Ecology. The Ecology Core serves as data repository and ecological analysis engine working in lockstep with the three Projects focused on different aspects of NSCLC ∆-Ecology (Immune and Stromal) to develop and apply spatial ecological models. These cores will serve our two projects: Project 1: Delta immune Ecology of NSCLC 1.1 Quantify the ∆-Ecology of patient samples pre- and on- treatment to predict outcomes; 1.2 Impact of KRAS inhibitor therapy with immunotherapy on lung tumor ecology; 1.3 Use predictive modeling to generate evolutionary inspired multi-agent treatment strategies. Project 2: Delta stromal Ecology of NSCLC 2.1 Decipher, in vivo, the ∆-Ecology of acquired resistance to targeted therapies in NSCLC; 2.2 Define the impact of stromal sheltering on the emergence of resistance and tumor growth relapse; 2.3 Discover optimal therapeutic strategies to suppress resistance.",2023-09-15T12:09:00Z,2028-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-21-048,nofo_RFA-CA-21-048,H.

U54CA274509,Spatiotemporal Tumor Analytics for Guiding Sequential Targeted-Inhibitor: Immunotherapy Combinations (ST-Analytics),"Overall Project Summary The proposed U54 program Spatiotemporal Tumor Analytics for Guiding Sequential Targeted-Inhibitor -- Immunotherapy Combinations (ST-Analytics) is designed to develop the recent conceptual advance that targeted inhibitor + cancer immunotherapy (IT) combination treatments may yield significantly greater patient benefit if those treatments are administered in sequence rather than simultaneously. Analysis of retrospective clinical data coupled with in vivo therapeutic modeling using syngeneic models of murine melanoma strongly support this concept. In fact, the picture that has emerged in melanoma is that immune factors can play a strong role in driving resistance to MAPK inhibitor (MAPKi) therapy, and that lead-in immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) can ‘prime’ both the primary tumor and distal metastases (including brain metastases) for eradication when the IT is subsequently combined with MAPKi. This observation opens the doors for immune based strategies, such as ICB or adoptive cell therapy (ACT), as sequential combinatorial agents to prevent MAPKi resistance. However, this concept introduces a number of new variables, including dosing, sequence, and timing. This can make the design and execution of clinical trials that can yield statistically significant outcomes impractical. This is the scientific and translational problem we address in the proposed ST-Analytics U54. The ST-Analytics U54 center is populated by leading scientists at the ISB, the UCLA Geffen School of Medicine, and Yale, and is comprised of two research projects and two research cores, with each project integrating both state-of-the-art experimentation and computational work. This structure is further designed to bring together the scientific, experimental, and computational and administrative resources to develop a data base that captures the kinetics of lead-in monotherapy tumor priming, and apply that data base to the development of predictive in silico models that can inform the design of such targeted inhibitor – immunotherapy sequence combinations for clinical trials. This requires close integration and cycles of iteration between of state-of-the-art experimentation, leading edge computation, and realistic disease models, continuously calibrated through the analysis of highly relevant, biopsied patient tumors. The resulting science also provides exciting opportunities for high impact STEM outreach. We propose to act on those opportunities by leveraging a long-standing systems education outreach program at ISB that already has impacted K-12 STEM education in all 50 states, and places an emphasis on those communities that have been historically under-represented in STEM.",2022-09-22T12:09:00Z,2027-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-21-048,nofo_RFA-CA-21-048,INSTITUTE FOR SYSTEMS BIOLOGY,SEATTLE,WA,UNITED STATES,csbc
U54CA274511,Systems Biology of Tumor-Immune-Stromal Interactions in Metastatic Progression,"ABSTRACT/SUMMARY – Overall Distant metastasis is the primary cause of cancer-related death. To colonize distant tissues, cancer cells must migrate while evading elimination by the immune system. Evidence suggests that key steps in the induction process of immune tolerance occur early in the metastatic cascade, located at the regional lymph nodes proximal to the primary tumor site. However, the nature of the interactions between malignant, immune and stromal cells remains poorly understood, including those that involve metastatic cells within the lymph nodes. Even though lymph nodes are in fact commonly assessed in cancer patients to determine disease stage and treatment plan, they are understudied in the context of metastatic progression. To fill this scientific knowledge gap, we propose a Research Center to unravel the role of lymph nodes in metastatic progression. We have established that lymph node metastasis constitutes an essential, first step in the metastatic cascade of cancer progression. We have found that such metastases act locally upon the adaptive immune system within the lymph nodes to begin to induce systemic tolerance of the tumor. We will further explore this new paradigm of metastases in two malignancies, head and neck cancer and lung adenocarcinoma, by focusing on the kinetics and spatiotemporal changes at the primary tumor, lymph node and distant sites, associated with the onset and progression of metastasis. We have assembled a multidisciplinary team whose coordinated efforts will involve the application of genomic and single-cell in-situ imaging technologies on preclinical and human samples to explore the evidence and mechanisms of the induction of immunosuppression in the lymph nodes. We propose two Research Projects that focus our scientific theme on lymph node metastasis by analyzing kinetics in a mouse model (Project 1) and spatial temporal changes in samples of lymph nodes and their concurrent primary tumor (Project 2), inter-connected through integrative computational analyses. Both projects will utilize a shared resource core dedicated to the acquisition of patient samples and associated clinical annotation and data management (Biospecimen Core and Data Core). These efforts will yield highly multiplexed, multi-scale datasets which will be analyzed by novel bio-computational methods to reconstruct intracellular and intercellular molecular interaction networks in order to identify, then functionally validate, critical mediators of metastasis. Our ultimate objective is to advance our understanding of the systemic consequences of lymph node metastases and identify new biomarkers and therapeutic approaches. Our Research Center is also dedicated to promoting our early investigators as the next generation thought leaders applying principles of systems biology to the study of metastasis. Our Outreach Core activity will ensure that our Research Center’s scientific and methodological advances in applying the principles of cancer systems biology toward the study of tumor-immune-stromal interactions are fully disseminated in the cancer research and broader communities.",2023-09-19T12:09:00Z,2028-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-21-048,nofo_RFA-CA-21-048,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,STANFORD,CA,UNITED STATES,csbc
U54CA277834,Partnership to Assess Viral and Immune Landscape Intersections with ONcology for People Living with HIV (PAVILION),"PROJECT SUMMARY – OVERALL The partnership center, entitled Partnership to Assess Viral and Immune Landscape Intersections with Oncology (PAVILION) for People Living with HIV Program will bring together experienced research sites and world- renowned HIV, human papillomavirus (HPV), Epstein Barr Virus (EBV), and cancer researchers to offer a novel contribution to the HIV-Associated Malignancies Research Center network. The PAVILION theme is research of understudied, virus-associated tumors that disproportionately impact men and women living with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). SSA remains home to two thirds of people living with HIV (PLWH). HIV-related immunosuppression results in an inability to control viruses and therefore a higher risk of virus-associated cancer, even among PLWH on effective antiretroviral therapy. The increasing life-expectancy of PLWH compounds this cancer risk as cancer is now a leading cause of mortality among PLWH in both high and low resource countries. Furthermore, PLWH experience poorer cancer treatment outcomes. Despite this, few studies of cancer etiology and cancer outcomes among PLWH in LMICs have been conducted, with little focus on HPV cancers at extra-cervical anatomic sites and very few studies of a suspected viral etiology for conjunctival tumors. PAVILION will therefore focus on the full range of cancers caused by HPV (anal, cervical, oropharyngeal, penile, and vulvar cancers) and the potential role of EBV in conjunctival squamous cell carcinoma - cancers that are disproportionality higher among PLWH, and which result in substantial morbidity and mortality. The overall goal of PAVILION is to provide the data necessary to inform prevention and therapeutic strategies to reduce the burden of cancers among PLWH in SSA. PAVILION includes partners in South Africa and Zimbabwe, multiple institutions in the US, and the DKFZ in Germany. Notably, Zimbabwe and South Africa have among the highest prevalence of HIV in Africa and have a rapidly increasing cancer burden that is largely comprised of infection-associated cancers. As a partnership, we have long standing collaborations, outstanding research leadership, mutual prioritization of the cancers to study, and institutional and consortium experience that will facilitate translation of scientific findings to achieve our goal. Specific Aims supporting this goal are: Aim 1: Establish a multi-national partnership with research infrastructure (Administrative & Coordinating, Central Laboratory, and Data Management & Statistics Cores) to conduct collaborative, innovative, and impactful research that advances prevention and treatment of infection-related cancers among PLWH in SSA Aim 2: Understand the fraction of tumors attributable to specific oncogenic viruses (i.e., HPV, EBV), the characterization of the immune microenvironment of tumors unique to the setting of HIV, and a more complete understanding of clinical outcomes for PLWH and cancer in SSA (Projects 1 and 2) Aim 3: Build capacity through active mentorship and training programs (Administrative & Coordinating and Developmental Cores) for early stage and junior faculty at partnership institutions",2023-08-03T12:08:00Z,2028-07-31T12:07:00Z,RFA-CA-22-011,nofo_RFA-CA-22-011,H.

U54CA277843,The AVANÇO Research Consortium: A Mozambique/Brazil/Texas Alliance to advance novel and affordable technologies for the prevention and diagnosis of cervical cancer in women living with HIV,"ABSTRACT The overall vision of the AVANÇO Research Consortium is to establish sustainable infrastructure to develop research programs focused on HIV-associated malignancies in Brazil and Mozambique. The research theme chosen for this U54 HIV-Associated Malignancy Research Center (HAMRC) is to develop novel, low-cost and technologically feasible approaches for cervical cancer screening, diagnosis, and treatment in women living with HIV (WLWH) in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). This HAMRC will be a collaboration between institutions in the US, Mozambique and Brazil and includes investigators with expertise in HIV/AIDS, Cervical Cancer, Bioengineering, Pathology, Epidemiology and Behavioral Science. The investigators have several ongoing scientific and clinical collaborations which include projects across all three countries. Our proposal addresses the NIH priority: To address HIV-associated comorbidities, coinfections and complications, which includes Malignancies as a category. HIV infection is a known risk factor for cervical cancer, with WLWH having an approximate 6-fold increased risk of developing cervical cancer. The overall goals of the AVANÇO Research Consortium include: 1) Establish sustainable research infrastructure to perform multi-institutional research studies related to HIV-associated malignancies across institutions in the US, Brazil and Mozambique. We will build a comprehensive research program focused on identifying novel, low-cost and technologically feasible approaches for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of cervical cancer in WLWH in LMICs. 2) Conduct two Research Projects that advance the development of promising low-cost technologies focused on the diagnoses of high-grade cervical dysplasia and invasive cervical cancer among WLWH. 3) Facilitate and enhance the professional development of junior investigators to conduct HIV- associated malignancy research in Mozambique and Brazil. Through our Developmental Core and Shared Resource Core, we will build research capacity and collaboration through formal research training courses, pilot project funding, and implementation of a Project ECHO® program for research capacity building focused on mentoring and supporting early-career investigators.",2023-08-01T12:08:00Z,2028-07-31T12:07:00Z,RFA-CA-22-011,nofo_RFA-CA-22-011,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,HOUSTON,TX,UNITED STATES,hamrcs
U54CA277846,Kaposi Sarcoma in the Era of ART in Africa Program (KEAAP),"There are currently over 1.2 million people in Zambia and 1.7 million in Tanzania who are living with HIV/AIDS. Concomitant to the HIV epidemic, there is a high incidence of HIV/AIDS-associated malignancies (HIVAM) in these two countries. Even in this era of antiretroviral therapy (ART) Kaposi sarcoma (KS) has remained one of the most common HIVAM. This underscores a critical need for research in the context of ART-mediated changes in the HIV epidemic so that we are better equipped to diagnose, manage, and prevent KS in sub- Saharan Africa (SSA). To address this need, the overall vision of the “Kaposi Sarcoma in the Era of ART in Africa Program (KEAAP)” is to build a collaborative network between the Cancer Diseases Hospital (CDH) and University Teaching Hospitals (UTH) in Zambia, the Ocean Road Cancer Institute (ORCI) in Tanzania, and the Stanley S Scott Cancer Center at the Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center-New Orleans (LSUHSC-NO) to conduct cutting edge research that will lead to a better understanding of KS, and in parallel, continue to enhance HIVAM and non-HIVAM research capacity in Zambia and Tanzania to meet the needs of the cancer patients. KEAAP’s theme centers on the research gaps of the KS disease spectrum, from detection, to care and outcomes, to deciphering KS pathogenesis and immune response towards achieving KEAAP’s overall goal to prevent and curing the disease. KEAAP’s immediate objective is to further enhance the cancer research infrastructure in CDH/UTH and ORCI through support for interdisciplinary and bilateral KS research projects to address some of the research gaps in SSA: 1) KS diagnosis and disease staging, and linking to care; 2) changes in the immune response and metabolomes in KS patients upon treatment; and 3) identification and characterization of KSHV tissue reservoirs, and the effects of ART and HIV on these reservoirs. This proposed consortium will provide diverse training activities in the U.S., Zambia, and Tanzania to engage the next generation of low and middle income countries (LMICs) and U.S. cancer researchers, increase local expertise, and enhance the transfer of technology. KEAAP’s goal will be accomplished through the completion of three specific aims:1) Develop the cancer research infrastructure at UTH/CDH and ORCI through the establishment and enhancement of three core facilities; 2) Provide an opportunity for former Fogarty trained fellows to lead three hypothesis-driven KS research projects; 3) Develop a pipeline of next- generation U.S. and LMICs cancer researchers through a) in-country workshops, b) pilot project funding, and c) short-term U.S. and in-country training. KEAAP is high impact because it builds on successful ongoing Fogarty and NCI training programs; it will implement a cross-disciplinary and tri-lateral research and training program that are driven by our Tanzanian and Zambian collaborators with broad local support to ensure their sustainability. The lessons learned will also benefit Louisiana HIV-1 and cancer research since the state has the fifth largest population of people living with HIV, mostly among its health disparities population.",2023-09-01T12:09:00Z,2028-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-22-011,nofo_RFA-CA-22-011,LSU HEALTH SCIENCES CENTER,NEW ORLEANS,LA,UNITED STATES,hamrcs
U54CA283114,Quantitative systems biology of glioblastoma cells and their interactions with the neuronal and immunological milieu,"ABSTRACT – OVERALL The primary focus of the MIT/DFCI Center for Systems Biology of Glioblastoma is to understand the intersections between neurons, immune cells, and tumor cells in this deadly tumor. The lack of response to immunotherapy strategies despite prominent infiltrates of immune cells in many GBM highlights the immuno- suppressive nature of the GBM microenvironment and the importance of more clearly understanding the dynamic interactions at the tumor/immune interface. Similarly, interactions between tumor cells and neural cells in the tumor microenvironment have emerged as driving forces in tumor progression and invasion, with electrical signals from neurons providing growth and migration stimuli to tumor cells, while tumor cells lead to aberrant electrical signaling in local neurons. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that developing a systems-level understanding of the dynamic interactions between tumor cells, neurons and immune cells will provide unprecedented insights into glioma tumor biology and foster development of novel therapeutic strategies to abrogate tumor invasion, enhance the efficacy of cytotoxic therapies, and increase clearance of tumor burden by the innate and adaptive immune system. The planned analyses will enable building an integrated computational model of tumor-neural-immune interactions for GBM tumors. The model will be based on a foundation of in vitro, in vivo, and ex vivo model systems, and then validated in dozens of human patients. Image-registered biopsies from different tumor regions within each patient will be analyzed to test predictions of this model against the ‘ground truth’ of human tumors. The ultimate goal of the MIT/DFCI Center for Systems Biology of Glioblastoma is to improve patient care by using systems biology and computational modeling to identify therapeutic strategies to specifically disrupt critical tumor cell – microenvironment interactions.",2023-09-15T12:09:00Z,2028-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-21-048,nofo_RFA-CA-21-048,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,CAMBRIDGE,MA,UNITED STATES,csbc
U54CA283759,University of Pennsylvania Patient-derived Xenograft Development and Trials Center,"Project Summary/Abstract: The overall goal of the University of Pennsylvania PDX Development and Therapeutics Center (UP-PDTC) is to (i) exploit the translational potential of PDX models for evaluating the response of various treatments in models with specific molecular characteristics and to (ii) work with PDXNet to enhance and extend use of PDX models to the research community with the goal to guide development of human Phase 1/2 clinical trials for human malignancies. As PDX models more faithfully reproduce human cancer than cell lines, they can contribute to the ultimate clinical implementation of cancer precision medicine. The UP-PDTC is uniquely poised to contribute to such research due to the long history of PDX research at UPENN. The UP-PDTC will comprise 4 Cores and 2 projects. The four Cores are: Administrative, PDX, Pilot Projects and Trans-Network, and a Bioinformatics Core. The Administrative Core will coordinate all UP-PDTC activities. The PDX Core builds on 15 years of experience within the Stem Cell and Xenograft Core facility of UPENN. The PDX Core currently provides over 900 mice per month to investigators at UPENN using PDX modeling for malignant and non-malignant disease. The animal facility of the PDX Core is a dedicated 6 room suite controlled by highly skilled PDX Core personnel with comprehensive infection control measures. Using these measures, the PDX Core has not had a significant infection in the colony in seven years. The Pilot Projects Core will take advantage of a growing group of collaborators to build tissue banks for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), breast cancer, glioblastoma, and myeloma. A major goal of the UP-PDTC is to develop and characterize new models across common and rare cancer types that can be linked with the originating patient clinical response profile and shared with PDXNet. The Bioinformatics Core takes advantage of the extensive Bioinformatics infrastructure at UPENN and will work with the Projects to more rigorously describe PDX modeling for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and ovarian cancer. There are two projects. Project One is directed by Dr. Martin Carroll and will focus on acute myeloid leukemia. Project 1 takes advantage of one of the largest tissue banks of viable, fully annotated AML samples in the world. This tissue bank currently has over 3300 collections from over 1700 patients collected over 20 years including over 40 PDX primograft models currently available of over 100 that have been described. Dr. Carroll, working with members of the PDX Core, has a long history of developing and using the AML PDX model to define AML biology and responses to therapy. Project 2 is directed by Dr. Fiona Simpkins and takes advantage of the Ovarian Cancer Research Center Tumor BioTrust Collection. This collection is fifteen years old, also fully annotated and includes 140 well characterized PDX models. Drs. Carroll and Simpkins, have extensive experience in xenotransplantation models and in the use of xenotransplantation models to both understand disease biology and develop new therapeutic approaches for implementation in clinical trials. In their projects, they propose two discrete xenotransplantation Phase 2 studies. Dr. Carroll will test the effects of a combined therapy with Menin inhibition and KAT6A inhibition on AML differentiation and disease burden. Dr. Simpkins will study TP53 wild type clear cell ovarian carcinoma (CCOC) and low-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (LGSOC) and their response in PDX models to a “p53 stabilizer combination” (MDM2 and XPO1 inhibition). Both Dr. Carroll and Dr. Simpkins have significant experience moving pre-clinical work into human early-stage clinical trials and we anticipate that these xenotransplant phase 2 (XP2) studies will lead to molecular defined Phase 1/2 human studies. Overall, the unique resources of the UP-PDTC should enhance the use of PDX models for robust and reproducible studies that will lead to precision targeted therapeutics in humans.",2023-07-05T12:07:00Z,2028-06-30T12:06:00Z,RFA-CA-22-012,nofo_RFA-CA-22-012,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,PHILADELPHIA,PA,UNITED STATES,pdxnet
U54CA283762,United for Health Equity - Living PDX Program (U4HELPP),"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – OVERALL The United for Health Equity-Living PDX Program (U4HELPP) seeks to develop >500 new patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of cancers originated from the breast, pancreas, colon, liver, lung, and other advanced peritoneal cancers. These PDXs will be made from >60% of patients from underrepresented populations which our safety-net clinical system serves. To develop such a large number and diverse set of PDXs, we have enlisted the support of a set of surgeons that specialize in each cancer type. Once extracted, the tumors are immediately provided to the U4HELPP PDX Core which functions to propagate, distribute, and cryopreserve them. Successfully generated PDXs will be subjected to genomic characterization and quantitative ancestral profiling by the U4HELPP Bioinformatics Core so that we can better understand how ancestry contributes to genetics and responses to targeted therapeutics. The PDXs will be provided to two Research Projects, that will focus on either pancreatic cancer or breast cancer. The Pancreatic Cancer project will generate large-scale proteomics insights from over 200 PDXs to refine subtypes of the disease and identify more effective therapeutics from Black and White patients. The Breast Cancer project will utilize 20 PDXs that are Basal-like breast cancers, characterize their metastatic profiles, define proteogenomic pathways that mediate metastatic growth, and target metastases with synergistic investigational new drug combinations. The information from these PDXs and Projects will be shared with the U4HELPP Pilot Projects and Trans-Network Activities Core which will award Pilot Project grants to utilize the PDXs generated by us and our partnering PDXNet institutions. All of the PDXs and insights gained will be shared with the NCI with the goal of reducing cancer disparities. Through this team effort we are confident that we will be able to develop these unique resources and generate significant preliminary data that will support investigator initiated clinical trials at the Massey Cancer Center.",2023-07-19T12:07:00Z,2028-06-30T12:06:00Z,RFA-CA-22-012,nofo_RFA-CA-22-012,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,RICHMOND,VA,UNITED STATES,pdxnet

Expanding the existing PDX infrastructure from our ongoing University of California Patient Derived and Trial Center (UCaMP, U54CA233306), UCaTS is comprised of six NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Centers (CCC): UC Davis Comprehensive Cancer Center (UCD) [lead institution], UC Irvine Chao Family Comprehensive Cancer Center (UCI), UC Los Angeles Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center (UCLA), UC San Diego Moores Cancer Center (UCSD), UC San Francisco Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center (UCSF), and the University of Texas Southwestern Harold C. Simmons Cancer Center (UTSW). Collectively, UCaTS includes a team of transdisciplinary investigators with strengths in PDX development, preclinical drug testing, cancer health disparities, clinical trial development, bioinformatics, and large multicenter administration. UCaTS will achieve its goal through two Research Projects. Project 1 – “Advancing gastric cancer precision medicine in Latinos through patient-derived modeling” focuses on developing novel, effective therapeutic regimens for most commonly druggable and genomically complex Latino GC subtype, which involves co-mutations in multiple pathway (such as cell cycle kinase, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, WNT and RTK-RAS) and to study resistance mechanisms to targeted therapies, identify response biomarkers and assess how ancestry influences response. Project 2 – “Precision targeting of disparity-associated EGFR mutant lung tumors to circumvent early resistance to EGFR inhibitors”, focuses on one of the most common lung cancer (LC) subtypes in minority populations, EGFR- mutated lung tumors. This molecular subtype represents a high proportion of lung cancer diagnosed in female patients of Latino and Asian ancestry.

U54CA285114,2/2 Drug Development and Capacity Building: A UCR/CoH-CCC Partnership,"The United States (U.S.) has led the world in drug discovery for over 50 years. While this is a significant accomplishment, U.S. drugs have been almost exclusively optimized and tested in non-Hispanic European- Americans and been minimally evaluated in men- or women-of-color. As a result, drugs that work well in non- Hispanic European-Americans (Anglos), may have unexpected toxicity or decreased efficacy in most of the world’s population. Disparities in U.S. drug development occur throughout the entire drug discovery pipeline. Only a small number of basic scientists are Latino/Hispanic- or African-American. Initial drug development and optimization takes place in cell lines derived from Anglos. Less than 2% of physicians conducting clinical trials are Latino/Hispanic- or African-American6. Most clinical trials participants are Anglos. Yet, new drugs are FDA approved for Latinos/Hispanics- and African-Americans/Africans without sufficient testing. It is unacceptable that drugs are developed by, and optimized for, only a fraction of our citizens. In this U54 partnership we aim to develop the resources, infrastructure, and training to mentor the next generation of researchers that reflect the diversity of our Catchment Area. Building on our successful P20 grant, here in this U54 partnership, UCR and CoHCCC aim to develop the collaborations, resources, and training programs to reduce disparities in drug development throughout the entire drug development pipeline. Our goal is for this program to become a focal point for UCR and CoHCCC to mentor and train a diverse force of cancer biologists and address the disparities in cancer therapeutics and drug development. Already, our P20 has fostered joint R01 grants, K01 grants, and pre-/post-doctoral fellowships. Both institutions are highly committed - CoHCCC contributed over $800K to our P20 grant and will contribute $250K/year to ensure the success of this U54 partnership. Aim 1 will strengthen UCR’s cancer research capacity and develop the resources to increase UCR/CoHCCC’s ability to jointly develop therapeutic agents optimized for the diverse populations in our catchment area. Aim 2 will increase the capacity of UCR and CoHCCC to jointly develop drugs that target disparities in survival affecting the diverse individuals living in our Southern California communities.

U54CA285115,2/2 Cancer Research and Education to Advance HealTh Equity (CREATE) Partnership,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – OVERALL The Cancer Research and Education to Advance HealTh Equity (CREATE) Partnership’s overarching goals are to further increase SDSU’s cancer research capacities and expand SDSU’s and UCSD’s emphasis on cancer health disparities research. Bi-directional community engagement is also a principal feature that is integrated across every organizational component in the CREATE Partnership and is a strength that SDSU has built over the last 30 years. Additional goals include developing cancer research opportunities and pathways for undergraduate, graduate, and medical students, as well as early-stage investigators (ESIs), which will lead to a future workforce that is more diverse and reflective of the catchment-area population. To meet these overarching goals, the following Specific Aims are proposed: 1) Recruit and support diverse ESIs who have chosen an intentional career goal to become independent, cancer-focused researchers (Administrative Core and Transforming fAcuLty dEvelopmeNT for Equity [TALENT] Shared Resource); 2) Conduct catchment-area relevant research and pilot research projects aligned with identified cancer priorities for the underserved communities in the region (Research and Research Pilot Projects and Planning and Evaluation Core); 3) Expand and implement cancer, cancer disparities, and community-engaged research education with a focus on under-represented students across SDSU and UCSD undergraduate, graduate programs, and medical students (Research Education Core); and 4) Integrate community engagement into all CREATE Partnership activities (Outreach Core). To achieve these aims, the CREATE Partnership requests the initial support for two Full Research Projects and one Pilot Research Project designed to provide insight into the mechanisms (or behaviors) underlying cancer health disparities. All three projects will be jointly led by SDSU and UCSD Co-Leads; Project 2 is co-led by two under-represented researchers. The Research Projects will be integrated with the Research Education Core, providing expanded research experiences in cancer, cancer disparities, and community-engaged research to under-represented undergraduate, graduate, and medical students.

U54CA285116,1/2 Drug Development and Capacity Building: A UCR/CoH-CCC Partnership,"The United States (U.S.) has led the world in drug discovery for over 50 years. While this is a significant accomplishment, U.S. drugs have been almost exclusively optimized and tested in non-Hispanic European- Americans and been minimally evaluated in men- or women-of-color. As a result, drugs that work well in non- Hispanic European-Americans (Anglos), may have unexpected toxicity or decreased efficacy in most of the world’s population. Disparities in U.S. drug development occur throughout the entire drug discovery pipeline. Only a small number of basic scientists are Latino/Hispanic- or African-American. Initial drug development and optimization takes place in cell lines derived from Anglos. Less than 2% of physicians conducting clinical trials are Latino/Hispanic- or African-American6. Most clinical trials participants are Anglos. Yet, new drugs are FDA approved for Latinos/Hispanics- and African-Americans/Africans without sufficient testing. It is unacceptable that drugs are developed by, and optimized for, only a fraction of our citizens. In this U54 partnership we aim to develop the resources, infrastructure, and training to mentor the next generation of researchers that reflect the diversity of our Catchment Area. Building on our successful P20 grant, here in this U54 partnership, UCR and CoHCCC aim to develop the collaborations, resources, and training programs to reduce disparities in drug development throughout the entire drug development pipeline. Our goal is for this program to become a focal point for UCR and CoHCCC to mentor and train a diverse force of cancer biologists and address the disparities in cancer therapeutics and drug development. Already, our P20 has fostered joint R01 grants, K01 grants, and pre-/post-doctoral fellowships. Both institutions are highly committed - CoHCCC contributed over $800K to our P20 grant and will contribute $250K/year to ensure the success of this U54 partnership. Aim 1 will strengthen UCR’s cancer research capacity and develop the resources to increase UCR/CoHCCC’s ability to jointly develop therapeutic agents optimized for the diverse populations in our catchment area. Aim 2 will increase the capacity of UCR and CoHCCC to jointly develop drugs that target disparities in survival affecting the diverse individuals living in our Southern California communities. Aim 3 will provide the training, opportunity, and mentorship to ensure that the next generation of therapeutic scientists and clinical trialists reflect the diversity of Southern California.",2023-09-22T12:09:00Z,2028-08-31T12:08:00Z,PAR-22-249,nofo_PAR-22-249,BECKMAN RESEARCH INSTITUTE/CITY OF HOPE,DUARTE,CA,UNITED STATES,pache
U54CA285117,1/2 Cancer Research and Education to Advance HealTh Equity (CREATE) Partnership,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – OVERALL The Cancer Research and Education to Advance HealTh Equity (CREATE) Partnership’s overarching goals are to further increase SDSU’s cancer research capacities and expand SDSU’s and UCSD’s emphasis on cancer health disparities research. Bi-directional community engagement is also a principal feature that is integrated across every organizational component in the CREATE Partnership and is a strength that SDSU has built over the last 30 years. Additional goals include developing cancer research opportunities and pathways for undergraduate, graduate, and medical students, as well as early-stage investigators (ESIs), which will lead to a future workforce that is more diverse and reflective of the catchment-area population. To meet these overarching goals, the following Specific Aims are proposed: 1) Recruit and support diverse ESIs who have chosen an intentional career goal to become independent, cancer-focused researchers (Administrative Core and Transforming fAcuLty dEvelopmeNT for Equity [TALENT] Shared Resource); 2) Conduct catchment-area relevant research and pilot research projects aligned with identified cancer priorities for the underserved communities in the region (Research and Research Pilot Projects and Planning and Evaluation Core); 3) Expand and implement cancer, cancer disparities, and community-engaged research education with a focus on under-represented students across SDSU and UCSD undergraduate, graduate programs, and medical students (Research Education Core); and 4) Integrate community engagement into all CREATE Partnership activities (Outreach Core). To achieve these aims, the CREATE Partnership requests the initial support for two Full Research Projects and one Pilot Research Project designed to provide insight into the mechanisms (or behaviors) underlying cancer health disparities. All three projects will be jointly led by SDSU and UCSD Co-Leads; Project 2 is co-led by two under-represented researchers. The Research Projects will be integrated with the Research Education Core, providing expanded research experiences in cancer, cancer disparities, and community-engaged research to under-represented undergraduate, graduate, and medical students. A TALENT Shared Resource will foster the career development of Partnership ESIs. The Outreach Core will develop new and strengthen existing community-academic partnerships to foster cancer research, education, and tailored outreach efforts with a focus on the dissemination and implementation of evidence-based interventions that can reduce the cancer burden.

UE5CA254170,Scalable multi-mode education to increase use of ITCR tools by diverse analysts,"Project Summary/Abstract We propose to develop content for, and deliver informatics training to a broad cross-section of citizens, scientists, and researchers in informatics. We will leverage and extend an existing training platform and content we have developed. We will improve cancer informatics literacy and the usability of existing ITCR tools, support future ITCR tool developers, and teach informatics to a broad cross-section of interested parties. Our success will both deepen expertise within the field and broaden the exposure of ITCR tools within currently-unengaged research communities. Specifically, we will: (1) develop and release a software platform for rapidly prototyping, validating, and sharing modular training materials that can be delivered in a range of formats from massive online open courses, to in-person short courses, to in depth semester long courses, (2) develop informatics courses teaching not only specific use of ITCR tools to solve concrete scientific challenges but also broadly the concepts of informatics to a broad community ranging from citizen scientists to NCI funded PIs, (3) develop courses for ITCR tool developers around usability, documentation, support and marketing to improve the impact of these tools in the field, and (4) deliver in person and ""train the trainer"" courses that will scale the impact of our educational program both within NIH funded cancer centers and into currently underserved researchers at community colleges, minority serving institutions, historically black colleges and universities, and engaged citizens outside of academia. All software, content, and data developed by our program will be open source and made accessible to the broadest possible audience by leveraging our existing expertise in online and scalable in-person education, along with our relationships to MOOC providers, informatics platforms, and developers. We will thus will dramatically increase cancer informatics knowledge and skill, and speed the adoption and use of data to tackle important problems in cancer throughout the research enterprise.",2020-09-01T12:09:00Z,2025-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-19-042,nofo_RFA-CA-19-042,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER CENTER,Seattle,WA,UNITED STATES,itcr
UG1CA242596,University of Arizona Cancer Prevention Clinical Trials Network (UA CP-CTNet),"PROJECT SUMMARY Advances in molecular understanding of the process of carcinogenesis have led to the study of an increasing number of agents to intercept the early phases of cancer development, including the recent interest in immunoprevention. The overall objective of University of Arizona Cancer Prevention Clinical Trials Network (UA CP-CTNet) is to perform early phase clinical trials to evaluate the biologic effects of putative preventive agents and to determine clinically relevant correlates in order to identify agents with good safety profiles and preliminary efficacy for definitive Phase III trials. The UA CP-CTNet consists of a team of physicians from diverse specialties, statisticians, clinical staff, data managers, pathologists, translational scientists, and other personnel with extensive experience in early phase clinical trials of cancer preventive agents and in translational research in various organ sites. Specifically, the UA CP-CTNet will: • Efficiently design and conduct Phase 0/I/II clinical trials to assess the cancer preventive potential of repurposed drugs that affect multiple chronic diseases, well-characterized nutraceutical agents, regional/topical drug delivery, and immune modulators, identified from translational research, epidemiological studies, and/or clinical research. • Characterize the clinical activity and biological effects of putative cancer preventive agents on their defined molecular/biochemical targets, the immune surveillance network, surrogate endpoints associated with carcinogenesis, and other biological effect markers identified in preclinical studies. • Develop further scientific insights into the mechanisms of cancer prevention by the agents studied and to develop novel potential markers as determinants of response and for selecting subpopulations who may differentially benefit from the studied agent. Through the proposed research, we expect to conduct rigorously designed early phase cancer prevention clinical trials that determine the clinical activity and biological effects of potential preventive agents. The research findings will further scientific insights into the mechanisms of cancer prevention and develop novel potential biomarkers as determinants of response. Scientific and clinical evidence generated from these early phase cancer prevention clinical trials will contribute significantly to “go-no go” decisions for further clinical development of putative agents for cancer prevention.",2019-08-16T12:08:00Z,2025-07-31T12:07:00Z,RFA-CA-18-029,nofo_CA-18-029,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,TUCSON,AZ,UNITED STATES,cp_ctnet
UG1CA242609,iCAN-PREVENT: MD Anderson International Cancer Prevention Clinical Trial Consortium,"Abstract Cancer-related death is the second most common cause of death in the US, and the most promising strategy to reduce cancer-related deaths and cancer incidence is through cancer prevention. Previous clinical trials have demonstrated the feasibility of preventing cancer using vaccines or cancer preventive drugs. However, the use of these agents is limited due to their side effects. Clearly, safer and more effective cancer prevention interventions that are acceptable to healthy individuals are urgently needed. Thus, the overarching goal of this application is to bring a team of basic, translational, and clinical researchers together to identify novel strategies to prevent cancer, test them in cancer prevention clinical trials, and ultimately bring safe, efficacious, and acceptable preventive therapies to general use in individuals at high- risk of this disease. To achieve this goal, we formed an international consortium (the iCAN- PREVENT consortium) comprised of cancer prevention experts, clinical trialists, molecular biologists, translational researchers, pathologists, statisticians, and bio-informatics experts, to develop and conduct early phase cancer prevention trials. Our clinical research team has vast experience in conducting both early and late phase clinical trials, and has conducted 18 Phase I and II cancer prevention clinical trials through our previous chemoprevention clinical trial consortia. Here, we propose two aims to test the hypothesis that we can conduct trials of drug and vaccine therapies and demonstrate that these preventive therapies will safely modulate critical tumor promoting pathways. Results from these early phase clinical trials will support the advancement of these interventions to Phase III testing, and ultimately support the FDA-approval of these interventions for cancer prevention. We will 1) conduct 5 to 10 early phase clinical trials testing the safety and activity of a series of promising cancer prevention drugs, vaccines, and immune modulating interventions in individuals at high-risk of cancer, and 2) develop and implement novel methods to enhance recruitment and retention of patients in prevention trials using social media, electronic news-blasts, and mobile messaging. To demonstrate our ability to develop novel cancer prevention trials, we provide two sample trials: a Phase I trial of a novel DNA-based vaccine encoding novel frameshift antigens that develop in individuals with Lynch Syndrome, and a Phase II trial testing the ability of the mTOR inhibitor everolimus to alter breast tissue biomarkers in individuals with prior triple-negative breast cancer. The results of these early phase trials will advance cancer prevention drug development, and will ultimately help reduce cancer incidence and mortality through prevention.",2019-08-15T12:08:00Z,2025-07-31T12:07:00Z,RFA-CA-18-029,nofo_CA-18-029,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,HOUSTON,TX,UNITED STATES,cp_ctnet
UG1CA242632,Early Phase Clinical Cancer Prevention Consortium,"Project Summary The Early Phase Clinical Cancer Prevention Consortium proposes to develop, implement, and complete early clinical trials targeting cellular stemness. Most cancers display a hierarchical organization that is driven by a population of cells that are “stem-like”. Inflammatory stress drives increased stem cell self-renewal across different organ sites. The sources of chronic inflammatory stess include obesity, explosures (alcohol, chemicals), infectious agents, microbial dysbiosis, and genetic polymorphisms. Of these, the obesity-associated metabolic syndrome associated is reaching epidemic proportions. This consortium addresses the overarching hypothesis that inflammatory-induced shifts in the tissue stromal environment increase stem cell self-renewal and enhance epithelial mesenchymal transformation. These shifts can be reversed or dampened by biomarker driven dosing of clinical preventive agents, either alone or in combination. We select agents that target the adverse metabolic milieu resulting from inflammatory exposures and driving stem cell proliferation. The Consortium proposes the following aims: 1. To develop and submit at least three proposals each year for early phase trials for the prevention of obesity-related cancers (colon, lower esophagus, breast, prostate, bladder); 2. To conduct 1 to 3 early phase cancer prevention trials per year within the fiscal capacity of the grant that include evaluating translational endpoints in biospecimens, asssessing the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, and obtaining mechanistic proof-of-principle data; and 3. To manage all aspects of study operations while complying with all applicable rules and regulations for the conduct of clinical trials. The University of Michigan Rogel Cancer Center is the lead organization of a consortium consisting of 9 institutions of which all are within NCI Core Funded Cancer Centers. The intellectual diversity and strong academic accomplishement of our consortium permits deep intellectual engagement combined with the experienced logistics of participant recruitment and retention, and the infrastructure support available in NCI supported cancer centers. We have established processes to ensure rapid turn-around of letters of intent and protocol documents, uniform sample handling, management and shipment, and rapid analysis of biosamples. The Consortium will collaborate with other the CP-CTNet consortia to create synergies of science and resources, enabling paradigm shifts that rapidly test and prioritize agents for Phase III trials conducted in individuals at increased risk of cancer.",2020-07-07T12:07:00Z,2025-06-30T12:06:00Z,RFA-CA-19-031,nofo_CA-19-031,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,ANN ARBOR,MI,UNITED STATES,cp_ctnet
UG1CA242635,The MW Cancer Prevention Clinical Trials Network,"ABSTRACT The need to provide safe and cost-effective measures to prevent Cancer is self-explanatory. The University of Wisconsin (UWISC) as the Lead Academic Organization (LAO) together with our collaborating institutions (Affiliated Organizations/AOs) propose to continue performing early phase cancer prevention trials, for the National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Prevention (DCP), as a Cancer Prevention Clinical Trials Network (CP-CTNET) site funded as a UG1 Consortium as described in RFA-CA-18-031. Our overarching goal is to evaluate the effects of novel preventive agents/interventions on pertinent biological endpoints in order to efficiently determine their appropriateness for further testing and potential viability toward becoming recommended societal interventions to lessen the burden of cancer. We will pursue this overarching goal via the following specific aims: (1) Efficiently design, conduct and perform Phase 0, 1, 2 Chemoprevention Clinical Trials of novel and/or re-purposed immunologic-based or molecular targeted agents, assessing their effects upon relevant biological (biomarkers/clinical effects) endpoints. (2) Build upon existing consortium infrastructure to complete Aim 1 via intra- or inter-consortium (CP-CTNET) multi-institutional collaborations in concert with NCI/DCP contributing three to four new Phase 0, 1 or 2 clinical trials and accrual of ≥ 40-50 subjects per year. We are well positioned to successfully achieve the above aims due to our combined experience with prevention agent development (consortium members currently hold >90 DCP sponsored R, U or PREVENT awards) and our consortium's staffing, organization, and management which results in the timely development, performance and completion of impactful, multi-institutional early phase cancer prevention trials. Our enhanced consortium consists of >10 NCI-designated Cancer Centers, institutions providing access to robust numbers of at-risk patients (e.g. Mayo Clinics, Seattle Cancer Care Alliance) and expanded access to at-risk under-represented minorities and special populations (e.g. University of Puerto Rico, Alaska Native Medical Center).

UG1CA242643,Northwestern Cancer Prevention Consortium,"Northwestern University proposes to continue to lead a consortium of organizations, the Northwestern Cancer Prevention Consortium (NCPC), to design and conduct early phase clinical trials aimed at developing new options for the prevention of cancer. To date, NCPC trials, 19 in total, have accrued 534 patients (354 from the 2003 consortium and 175 from the 2012 consortium), targeting multiple organ sites and a variety of agents. We have tested innovative concepts, e.g., transdermal drug delivery, and utilized novel biomarkers, such as nanocytological alterations. Our proposal to renew the NCPC, under the leadership of Seema A. Khan MD includes academic partners included in the current consortium and new members who are expected to add important strengths to it (the University of Toronto and City of Hope). In the new cycle of the NCPC, we will continue to build on promising approaches based on prior or ongoing successful trials, while providing oversight, consultation, and administrative support to cancer prevention research teams. We will assist in the design of cancer prevention trials, in proposal and protocol development, and in the implementation of such trials. Our overarching goal is to continue our contributions to cancer prevention science through the development of innovative, transformative, early phase trials testing new conceptual approaches that will enable clinical advances in the prevention of cancer. Our Aims are to 1. Advance high priorities in cancer prevention, for maximum impact on cancer incidence when these are advanced into clinical use. These priorities include (i) investigate novel agents and repurposed agents that target mutations and pathways known to be important in the development of cancer, (ii) novel or established biomarkers to identify individuals most like to predict benefit from a given approach, (iii) trials that will result in unifying biological themes across different organ sites, leading to protection against more than one cancer type, (iv) test innovative dosing and delivery methods, to reduce the symptom and toxicity burden for users of cancer prevention agents. 2. Provide consultation, scientific guidance, and mentoring to consortium investigators who are proposing new trial concepts; assist consortium investigators through trial design, initiation, conduct, and analysis; and to serve as the administrative hub of the consortium. We will foster communication, collaboration, and sharing of available resources between consortium members and across consortia, to maximize impact of clinical trials testing similar interventions or in similar populations. Serve as a liaison between the consortium and the NCI DCP, by maintaining and improving an NCPC 3. Advance the science of cancer prevention, through evaluation and selection of innovative or transformative concepts that result in progress that is greater than the sum of knowledge gained from the specific goals of an individual trial.

UG1CA275400,HIV/cervical cancer cOntrol and Prevention clinical sitE in Kenya (HOPE-Kenya),"ABSTRACT Cervical cancer (CC) is a highly preventable disease and yet hundreds of thousands of women die each year from CC with the large majority of deaths occurring in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). LMICs in sub- Saharan Africa (SSA) are particularly affected because of the dual burden of human papillomavirus (HPV) and HIV infection which interact with deadly synergism. Women living with HIV (WLWH) have accessed antiretroviral therapy (ART) across SSA but have yet to fully benefit from integrated CC screening and treatment services. The challenges lie not in any particular barrier to care but in the many gaps that occur in the cascade of CC prevention from screening uptake to management of positive cases to treatment access and application. Clinical research sites are needed worldwide to implement clinical trials that examine potential interventions and one of the most ideal locations may be found at the Coptic Hope Center for Infectious Diseases in Nairobi, Kenya. Co- founded by Dr. Michael Chung (MPI) and Dr. Samah Sakr (MPI) at the Coptic Hospital in 2004, the Hope Center is one of the largest single-site ART treatment centers in Kenya having enrolled over 20,000 people living with HIV (PLWH) with over 6,000 WLWH currently in care. The Hope Center has been screening WLWH for cervical cancer since 2005 and has been the site for HIV CC research and many clinical trials conducted by Treatment, Research, and Expert Education (TREE), which Dr. Chung leads as Executive Director. Based at the Hope Center, TREE has a powerful physical, administrative, and laboratory infrastructure that has been implementing HIV clinical trials at the site for over a decade including a study that screened over 6,000 WLWH with Papanicolaou (Pap) smear and colposcopy-directed biopsy, randomized 400 to cryotherapy and loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP), and examined recurrence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), cervical shedding of HIV, and clearance of HPV over 2-year follow-up. In this proposal, Dr. Chung and Dr. Sakr will co-lead the implementation of a clinical site at the Hope Center in Nairobi by Coptic Hospital and TREE that, with assistance from Drs. Mary Nderitu (co-I) and Evans Nyongesa-Malav (co-I), will study interventions that will: 1) increase screening uptake among WLWH; 2) improve management of women who screen positive; and 3) optimize precancer treatment for WLWH. They will achieve this by providing: 1) a pluripotent infrastructure for accruing participants to network clinical trials from the Hope Center and a network of four Coptic HIV Clinics throughout the country that are overseen by Dr. Andrew Nagy (co-I) for a total of 6,533 CC screen eligible WLWH between the ages of 25 and 49; 2) insights and input on clinical significance and study feasibility during concept and protocol development through the participation of Dr. Chung and Dr. Sakr; and 3) and on-site operational leadership for the successful conduct of network clinical trials by TREE and its staff led by Dr. Rose Kosgei (co-I).",2022-09-08T12:09:00Z,2027-05-31T12:05:00Z,RFA-CA-21-047,nofo_CA-21-047,EMORY UNIVERSITY,ATLANTA,GA,UNITED STATES,cascade

Functioning as a scientific hub of the CASCADE Network, CLIMB will drive the network's scientific agenda through skilled and innovative scientific and statistical leadership, rigorous and robust operational oversight, and training and capacity-building opportunities to facilitate research, implementation, and scale-up of cervical cancer prevention interventions in intended-use settings. Our highly capable team of investigators has complimentary and integrated multidisciplinary research and clinical expertise in HPV/cervical cancer prevention and control, gynecologic oncology, women's health, and HIV/AIDS; methodological expertise in epidemiology, statistics, and implementation science; and a strong record of leading clinical trials and studies across the continuum of effectiveness to implementation research in both the US and in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The specific aims are to: 1) Develop and conduct rigorous pragmatic, multi-site clinical trials that address unmet needs in cervical cancer prevention for WLWH, and 2) Nurture emerging investigators in resource-limited settings by offering mentorship, capacity-building opportunities and training in the skills and disciplines needed to lead future research in cervical cancer prevention. We will develop trial concepts and protocols and lead implementation, operational oversight, statistical analysis, and manuscript preparation for three trials. We propose pragmatic trials to evaluate important clinical effectiveness and implementation outcomes in the US and in LMICs, with the following aims: 1) Compare strategies for offering HPV self-sampling vs. local standard of care screening approaches on rates of screening and precancer detection; 2) Compare molecular triage (e.g., p16/ki-67 dual stain, methylation) vs. immediate ablation after an HPV-positive result on follow-up rates of HPV/precancer detection; 3) Compare a task shifting strategy to nurses with electronic quality assurance for same day cervical cancer screening and treatment vs. usual care procedures that require referral for follow-up on rates of screening and treatment; and 4) Compare thermal ablation vs. LEEP for treating precancers in WLWH with type 2 transformation zones on rates of post-treatment HPV detection/precancer recurrence. We will leverage the University of Washington Department of Global Health's Treatment, Research, and Expert Education and E-Learning Programs to deliver training and capacity-building activities to CASCADE Clinical Sites, including synchronous online courses in research fundamentals, virtual and on-site trainings to build research capacity, and on-site clinical training in cervical cancer prevention.

UG1CA275403,UNC CASCADE Network Research Base,"ABSTRACT The Director-General of the World Health Organization has called for invasive cervical cancer (ICC) elimination by 2030. Women living with HIV (WLWH) have a ~10-fold higher risk of ICC. There is an urgent need for high quality evidence on optimal strategies for ICC prevention directly applicable to WLWH who face a disparate burden of cervical precancer and ICC. We will establish a CASCADE Network UG1 Research Base (RB) at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill (UNC) to prevent ICC among WLWH. The overarching goal of this UNC RB proposal is to develop, test, and implement effective, scalable, and cost-effective screening and treatment strategies to reduce ICC among WLWH. We will develop, implement, and analyze innovative hybrid effectiveness-implementation trials in the CASCADE Network focus areas of “Improving the Management of Screen Positives” and “Optimizing Precancer Treatment”. The UNC RB will be composed of clinicians, epidemiologists, biostatisticians, and training experts with decades of research experience on ICC prevention and HIV in both LMIC and the US. Our multi-disciplinary team has expertise in implementation science, screening with automated visual evaluation (AVE), pathology, and cost-effectiveness analyses. In Aim 1, we will Develop CASCADE Network trials of evidence-based interventions to optimize the screening for and management of cervical precancer among WLWH by 1) providing scientific, clinical and statistical expertise to develop innovative concepts and protocols for novel, yet pragmatic, hybrid effectiveness- implementation trials, and 2) creating organized processes to efficiently develop concepts and protocols by leveraging diverse input from the UNC RB Scientific, Statistical, Clinical Sites Advisory, Patient Advocacy Advisory, and Scientific Advisory Committees. As an illustrative example of a potential clinical trial for “Improving Management of Screen-Positives”, we propose Protocol 1, a stepped wedge cluster randomized trial to Evaluate AVE triage versus HPV-and-treat among HPV-positive WLWH for CIN2+ prevention. For “Optimizing Precancer Treatment”, we propose Protocol 2, a Hybrid Type 1 trial to evaluate the effectiveness of adjuvant, self- administered intravaginal topical therapy following primary 2/3 treatment to prevent CIN2+ recurrence among WLWH. Outcomes for both trials will include clinical effectiveness for precancer, implementation outcomes, and cost effectiveness analyses. In Aim 2, we will ensure successful Implementation and Analysis of CASCADE Network trials by providing scientific, clinical and statistical expertise, operational support, and regulatory oversight. In Aim 3, we will provide Rigorous Foundational Clinical and Research Training for UG1 Clinical Sites and Early-Stage Investigators to design and implement clinical effectiveness research.

UG1CA275412,Implementing HIV/Cervical Cancer Prevention CASCADE Clinical Trials in Uganda (CASCADE UGANDA),"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Uganda is one of 8 countries with the highest burden of cervical cancer (CXCA) among women living with HIV (WLWH) with an HIV-attributable age-standardized incidence rate of 10–20 per 100,000. Strategies for Cervical Cancer (CXCA) prevention include targeted Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination, screening of women aged 25-49 years by visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) or HPV DNA testing, and precancer treatment by cryotherapy or ablation. However, there is limited and sparse availability of and access to CXCA interventions which is compounded by low-uptake of ‘screen and treat’ strategies. Scalable, affordable, point-of-care, clinically proven novel interventions (including HPV self-sampling techniques, HPV molecular biomarker tests, precancer diagnostics and imaging techniques, and ablative and excisional treatments) are imperative. Further, the effectiveness of these novel clinically proven interventions remains unknown which limits implementation in intended-use settings in the US and low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). To support on-going efforts to roll-out novel screen and treat strategies, the Makerere University Walter Reed Project (MUWRP) in partnership with the U.S. Military HIV Research Program (MHRP) propose to participate in the HIV/Cervical Cancer Prevention ‘CASCADE’ Clinical Trials Network as a UG1 Clinical Research Site (UG1 CRS) to implement pragmatic clinical trials in Uganda. We will: 1) leverage MUWRP’s expertise and experience in clinical trials and CXCA prevention among WLWH to provide valuable insight and input on study feasibility, clinical significance and local context during concept and protocol development; 2) accrue CASCADE targets in a timely manner and retain ≥ 95% of study participants leveraging MUWRP’s pluripotent experience, clinical research infrastructure and resources; and 3) provide competent leadership to ensure procedural fidelity to protocols and all applicable regulations and guidelines. MUWRP will also support UG1 Research Bases and U24 Coordination Center to obtain ethical and regulatory approvals for CASCADE trials, and implement clinical trial protocols with fidelity. MUWRP is an ideal and rational choice for a UG1 CRS as MUWRP has: 1) access to over 37,000 WLWH in urban, semi-urban, and rural settings at 114 health facilities supported by MUWRP’s Comprehensive HIV/AIDS Prevention, Care and Treatment in Central Uganda (CARE) program funded by the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR); 2) extensive experience conducting HIV clinical research and CXCA screening and precancer treatment in the African Cohort Study, and CARE supported CXCA program; and 3) internationally renowned scientists with experience and expertise in conducting clinical trials involving WLWH in Uganda and other LMICs. MUWRP’s expertise and capacity will support all four research focus areas of the CASCADE Network. MUWRP and MHRP will generate evidence that ultimately informs CXCA policy and screen and treat strategies for WLWH.",2022-09-08T12:09:00Z,2027-05-31T12:05:00Z,RFA-CA-21-047,nofo_CA-21-047,MAKERERE UNIVERSITY WALTER REED PROJECT,KAMPALA,,UGANDA,cascade

The proposed trials will include an investigation of primary HPV screening to facilitate uptake of cervical cancer screening, triage strategies for women who screen positive with high-risk HPV, and adjunctive treatment to improve outcomes to cervical pre-cancer treatments. We will also provide opportunities for early-stage investigators to develop clinical research skills within CASCADE. We have administrative expertise and experience in operationalizing international clinical trials and supporting clinical research sites in the timely implementation of projects.

UG1CA275416,Botswana CASCADE Clinical Trials Site,"Project Summary / Abstract Successful HIV treatment programs in Botswana and elsewhere in southern Africa have led to dramatic reductions in mortality from tuberculosis, cryptococcosis, and other non-cancer AIDS deaths. However, cancer deaths have not decreased, and cervical cancer now is the leading cause of death for women living with HIV in the region. Cervical cancer is preventable with early detection and treatment of precancerous lesions but challenges of limited access to initial screening, poor performance of initial screening technologies, high prevalence of cervical precancers, and persistent or relapsed dysplasia following therapy impair the impact of programs for women living with HIV. Working to develop strategies to these challenges, we will establish the Botswana CASCADE Clinical Trials Site at BHP that will participate in and contribute to the following high- impact areas of research: 1) Enhancing cervical precancer screening uptake through patient and context relevant approaches, including HPV self-sampling, non-clinical screening venues, and screening during antenatal care; 2) Strategies and novel technologies to improve management of positive HPV initial screening maximize prevention of invasive cancer while minimizing patient risk and consumption of health system resources; 3) Improving precancer treatment access, treatment completion, and outcomes; and 4) Optimizing treatment approaches to cervical precancers including comparative trials of ablation techniques, intervals of repeat evaluation, and vaccines or other immunologic therapies. The Botswana CASCADE Clinical Trials Site will contribute to conducting high-quality clinical research studies, provide context-relevant input on developing trial concepts, understand disparity in access by geography, economic factors, and language/ethnicity, and continue to develop local research capacity through mentoring and training.",2022-09-05T12:09:00Z,2027-05-31T12:05:00Z,RFA-CA-21-047,nofo_CA-21-047,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,BOSTON,MA,UNITED STATES,cascade
UG1CA284671,CAPRISA CASCADE Clinical Trials Network Clinical Research Site,"Summary The Center for the AIDS Program of Research in South Africa (CAPRISA) CASCADE Clinical Trials Network Clinical Research Site, aims to provide clinical trial infrastructure and operational leadership for the conduct of pragmatic clinical trials through the CASCADE Clinical Trials Network. The proposed clinical trial site is strategically located in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) province, the epicentre of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) epidemic in South Africa. Due to the high background HIV prevalence in this setting, KZN province remains a region with a high burden of cervical cancer disease, despite expansion and improved access to antiretroviral treatment (ART). CAPRISA has been undertaking high-impact globally relevant and locally responsive research for nearly two decades. The Ethekwini Clinical Research Site (ECRS) is one of four clinical research sites and is based in the central business district in Ethekwini. This is a well-established research site, with over 15 years’ experience conducting high-quality clinical trials. We have established research infrastructure which supports the conduct of both CAPRISA-led research as well as National Institutes of Health (NIH) network- affiliated trials, primarily recruiting young women for participation in our trials. To date, our core focus of research has been HIV prevention, although we are equally experienced in research involving HIV pathogenesis and clinical management of women living with HIV (WLHIV). Together with previous Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) epidemiological studies undertaken by our team, we have begun preliminary work in cervical cancer screening in an ongoing CAPRISA trial, where we are evaluating HPV point-of-care testing in WLHIV. Through the CASCADE network we aim to support and advance cervical cancer prevention, through participation in clinical trials. Through our relevant clinical trial experience and scientific expertise, we are able to contribute to the four scientific focus areas proposed by the network: increasing screening uptake, improving management of screen positives, facilitating precancer treatment access and optimising precancer treatment for cervical cancer prevention in WLHIV. We have assembled a strong team of investigators to support this program, including a Principal Investigator (PI) and Co-Investigators who have led multiple HIV and COVID-19 clinical trials at a site level and are leading several NIH-funded protocols as national PIs or protocol co-Chairs. The team are able to contribute to protocol development and to provide laboratory, data management and statistical support for trials undertaken through the network. Furthermore, we are able to collaborate with the respective research bases and coordinating centers proposed by the network. Considering CAPRISA’s expertise in HIV research and preliminary work undertaken in HPV epidemiology and HPV diagnostics, we are well-placed to be a strong partner in the CASCADE network.",2023-09-05T12:09:00Z,2027-05-31T12:05:00Z,RFA-CA-22-051,nofo_CA-22-051,CENTRE/AIDS PROGRAMME/RES/SOUTH AFRICA,Durban,,SOUTH AFRICA,cascade
UG1CA284883,Baltimore CASCADE Study Site (BaCSS Project),"Baltimore CASCADE Study Site (BaCSS Project) Project summary Women living with HIV (WLWH) have a higher risk of cervical cancer because of incomplete immune reconstitution and high prevalence of risk factors for cervical cancer. The risk is greater among African American (AA) WLWH in economically and socially disadvantaged areas such as West Baltimore because of intersection with race, gender, social determinants of health (SDOH), and HIV co-morbidities including substance abuse. Despite the widespread availability of population-based cervical cancer screening in the US, AA-WLWH living in disadvantaged areas have lower rates of screening uptake. Strategic evaluations of recently developed and emerging methods and technologies for cervical cancer prevention in intended use settings are urgently needed to address the cervical cancer prevention needs of this population. In the BaCSS project, we engage the clinical and population science resources of the University of Maryland School of Medicine (UMSOM) to establish a clinical study site for the CASCADE network. The site will enroll AA-WLWH into implementation science studies and clinical trials of evidence-based interventions for the prevention and early diagnosis of cervical cancer.

UG1CA284884,Georgia Consortium to Eliminate Cervical Cancer in Women Living with HIV (GaCECC-WLWH),"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Women living with HIV (WLWH) have a substantially increased risk for cervical cancer when compared to women without HIV infection (1). Georgia has the second largest population of people living with HIV in the US, with a prevalence of 1.9 times the national rate (2). Simultaneously, Georgia’s rates of cervical cancer are notably higher than the national average with 8.0 per 100,000 women diagnosed between 2015-2019 (3). Black women are disproportionately impacted by HIV(4) and cervical cancer in Georgia (5) and have significantly higher rates of being lost to follow-up and not undergoing colposcopy or treatment after an abnormal cervical cancer screen when compared to white women (6). It is thus imperative that Georgia is a focal point of pragmatic clinical trials to address cervical cancer screening and treatment among WLWH who face health disparities. The Georgia Consortium to Eliminate Cervical Cancer in Women Living with HIV (GaCECC) encompasses established, well- funded programs in Georgia that service WLWH and are primed to conduct the ‘CASCADE’ Network clinical trials. The GaCECC includes Emory University HIV research and clinical networks, urban and rural Ryan White funded clinics, Morehouse School of Medicine’s (MSM’s) extensive community networks, Georgia Cancer Center for Excellence at Grady Health System (GCCE), and respected HIV and women’s health community-based organizations in Georgia. The GaCECC has access to thousands of WLWH through various clinical sites that served over 9,000 WLWH and performed over 5,000 cervical cancer screenings between 2020-2021 in both urban and rural settings across Georgia. These sites serve high proportions of Black women who are disproportionately affected by social determinants of health. The GaCECC’s experienced client navigation services will work to optimize participant access to and completion of recommended screening and treatment sequences. The GaCECC recruitment and retention team will assure seamless linkage of care between positive screens at community clinics and colposcopy at the GCCE. Grady Memorial Hospital will provide its Grady Mobile Health Center Vehicle to bring colposcopy to women who are unable to travel to the GCCE. Emory University, MSM, and AAPHC partner gynecologists will deliver ‘CASCADE’ Network protocol-based treatment at the GCCE, Ponce Infectious Disease Clinic, and rural gynecology offices associated with AAPHC. Experienced investigators and research staff in HIV and HPV clinical trials will proficiently implement clinical trials protocols and ensure optimal retention. The GaCECC will use the strengths and resources leveraged by each collaborator in this consortium to address cervical cancer prevention for WLWH. In sum, the GaCECC will harness its clinical and research leadership in HIV care and cervical cancer prevention (Aim 1) to advance research in cervical cancer prevention among WLWH through the ‘CASCADE’ Network clinical trial, (Aim 2) to implement pragmatic clinical trials in cervical cancer prevention across all four scientific focus areas (Aim 3) and to utilize its network of community partnerships to enroll and retain WLWH with an emphasis on equity and diversity.",2023-08-15T12:08:00Z,2027-05-31T12:05:00Z,RFA-CA-22-051,nofo_CA-22-051,EMORY UNIVERSITY,ATLANTA,GA,UNITED STATES,cascade
UG1CA284908,Rwanda CASCADE Clinical Trials Site for cervical cancer prevention,"ABSTRACT Cervical cancer is a highly preventable malignancy caused by high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) but is not fully prevented, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). Women living with HIV (WWH) have higher rates of hrHPV infection and 6-fold higher rates of invasive cervical cancer. Sub-Saharan Africa carries the highest burden of cervical cancer globally, as well as the highest global burden of HIV. The Einstein/Rwanda Research and Capacity Building Program (ER-RCBP) has been conducting research in cervical cancer prevention for Rwandan WWH since 2005, conducting community- and clinic-based research in screening uptake, screening modalities, assessing HPV vaccine effectiveness, evaluating how to implement innovative screening approaches, and developing pathology and molecular laboratory capacity. We have enrolled nearly 10,000 women WWH and 3,000 HIV-negative women in studies of cervical HPV infection and disease. ER-RCBP’s primary partner in this application, and in prior research in HIV services and cervical cancer prevention, is the Rwanda Biomedical Center (RBC), the implementation arm of Rwanda’s Ministry of Health for healthcare delivery and research. Rwanda has an extremely effective HIV healthcare program, an equally effective program for HPV vaccination of girls, and has recently launched a cervical cancer screening and prevention program with primary HPV testing followed by visual inspection of the cervix and immediate treatment with thermal ablation, if indicated, for screen-positive women. Rwanda is thus an ideal location for testing strategies for effective cervical cancer screening in a low-income country with a high burden of HIV, cervical cancer, and a large unscreened population. We propose here a clinical trials site in Rwanda as part of the CASCADE Clinical Trials Network for Cervical Cancer Prevention. Lessons learned in Rwanda can be generalized to many low-income countries in sub-Saharan Africa.",2023-09-22T12:09:00Z,2027-05-31T12:05:00Z,RFA-CA-22-051,nofo_CA-22-051,RESEARCH FOR DEVELOPMENT,KIGALI,,RWANDA,cascade
UG1CA284918,Implementing HIV/Cervical Cancer Prevention CASCADE Clinical Trials in Zimbabwe (ZIM-CASCADE),"Project Summary/Abstract Zimbabwe is a resource-constrained country with a high burden of HIV and cervical cancer (CXCA). Zimbabwean women with CXCA present with advanced disease and two-thirds die within a year of diagnosis. CXCA screening has low coverage (13%), and is conducted largely through visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA), with plans to migrate to human papillomavirus (HPV) deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) testing. Precancer treatment is mostly cryotherapy or thermal ablation but is only accessed by 53% of women screen positive. To meet the WHO 2030 target of eliminating CXCA by 2120, Zimbabwe needs new interventions that are acceptable, affordable, point-of-care, scalable, and clinically proven. To optimize CXCA screening and the pre- cancer treatment cascade for women living with HIV (WLWH), University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) and the University of Zimbabwe–Clinical Trials Research Centre (CTRC), in collaboration with local PEPFAR- funded implementation partners Organization for Public Health Interventions and Development (OPHID) and the Zimbabwe Technical Assistance, Training and Education Center for Health (Zim-TTECH) (collectively, ZIM-CASCADE) propose to serve as a LMIC CASCADE UG1 Clinical Site. ZIM-CASCADE draws on extensive experience in conducting clinical research and CXCA screening and treatment among WLWH, with access to 95,000 WLWH, of whom >44,000 are currently receiving comprehensive CXCA screening and treatment through the OPHID and Zim-TTECH programs located in Zimbabwe’s high-density population centers of Harare and Chitungwiza. ZIM-CASCADE will be led by 2 gynecological oncologists with globally recognized expertise in CXCA screening and treatment and will utilize research personnel and infrastructure from dedicated clinical research sites and community-based primary care clinics, whose experience has been developed over nearly 3 decades of continuous research activities. ZIM-CASCADE will participate in all 4 scientific focus areas of the CASCADE Network, and will complete the following Specific Aims: (1) Provide insight as to clinical significance and feasibility of planned trials by drawing on extensive clinical expertise in CXCA prevention among WLWH; (2) Utilize the expansive pluripotent infrastructure and research management systems developed over 28 years to conduct high quality pragmatic clinical trials; (3) Accrue and retain eligible WLWH through effective and equitable engagement with community partners; and (4) Ensure compliance with all protocol procedures and applicable research regulations.

(1) In East Africa, 2020 estimates reported that a quarter of new cervical cancer cases could be attributed to HIV infection. (2) Cervical cancer morbidity and mortality reflects global inequity with the most vulnerable populations carrying the greatest disease burden. The KEMRI-CCR-PHRD research clinic in partnership with LVCT Health Dhibiti HIV/TB PEPFAR/CDC program (supporting 31,800 PLHIV in central region of Kenya) have organized a consortium of HIV and cervical cancer clinical, research and program experts and through this application propose to join the UG1 as a Network clinical trial site and implement HIV/cervical cancer prevention studies. We propose to implement the UG1 Network studies at three selected HIV care clinics based in rural urban public hospitals in Kiambu county (Thika level 5, Ruiru level 4, Igegania level 4 hospitals). The three selected hospitals are part of ten reproductive health (RH) clinics implementing the ‘TIBA’ study (5R01CA258590-02 Mugo), an implementation science study evaluating the implementation of Screen and Treat (SAT) + Single Visit Approach (SVA) with Thermal Ablation (TA).

The overall goal of our project, Accelerating Colorectal Cancer Screening and Follow-up through Implementation Science in Chicago (ACCSIS-Chicago), is to test a multilevel, multicomponent intervention to increase rates of CRC screening, follow-up, and referral-to-care among racial/ethnic minority and low income populations in Chicago, Illinois. In this project, we will include two different types of implementation strategies: 1) evidence-based multilevel, multicomponent intervention to increase rates of CRC screening, follow-up, and referral-to-care; and 2) implementation support strategies to support the implementation process that contribute to the adoption, implementation and sustainment of our proposed multilevel, multicomponent intervention. We will partner with 4 federally qualified health centers (FQHCs), which have 35 clinics in the Chicago area and provided primary care service to nearly 188,000 racial/ethnic minority and low income populations in 2016. During the UG3 Planning-Exploratory Phase, we will work with one of the 4 FQHC partners to pilot test, measure, and refine our proposed multilevel, multicomponent intervention in preparation for the experimental trial in the UH3 Implementation Phase, as well as assess the effectiveness of our implementation support strategies. In the UH3 Implementation Phase, we will use a stepped wedge cluster randomized trial design to examine the effectiveness and impact of our multilevel, multicomponent intervention on increasing rates of CRC screening, follow-up, and referral-to-care across our 4 partner FQHCs. The selection of our intervention components will be based on intensive literature review, and findings and lessons learned from our previous studies and projects. Our multilevel intervention components will include EMR provider reminders, provider assessment and feedback, patient navigation, provider education and community outreach. We will also test one local innovation, IL ColonCARES, during the UGH Phase to increase the rate of follow-up after a positive stool test among uninsured patients by linking uninsured patients with specialty services.

UG3CA233251,"Scaling Colorectal Cancer Screening Through Outreach, Referral, and Engagement (SCORE): A State-Level Program to Reduce Colorectal Cancer Burden in Vulnerable Populations","PROJECT SUMMARY Despite strong evidence that colorectal cancer (CRC) screening reduces mortality, rates of CRC screening, follow-up, and referral-to-care (herein referred to as “CRC screening”) remain suboptimal in the US. In North Carolina (NC), underuse of screening contributes to particularly high CRC burden in certain regions. Community health centers (CHCs) play a critical role in providing CRC screening for these vulnerable populations. Yet, CRC screening rates in NC CHCs are well below the estimated national rate of 62%. Substantial efforts are needed to reach the national target of 80%. Because multiple patient-, provider-, and system-level factors contribute to low screening rates, multilevel interventions are needed to achieve screening targets. Accumulating evidence shows that interventions involving mailed screening outreach, practice-based screening in-reach (using patient navigators), and systematically improving colonoscopy access, all increase screening. However, in practice, CHCs face substantial resource limitations and lack the means to systematically implement a multi-level intervention of outreach, in-reach, and improved colonoscopy access for uninsured patients. Until a multi-level intervention is shown to be both effective and cost-effective from stakeholder perspectives, screening rates will remain low, leaving thousands of vulnerable patients at risk. We hypothesize that standardizing these interventions for CHCs at the state-level will yield cost-effective approaches to increasing screening. Our long-term goal is to reduce CRC burden and disparities through improved screening. Our objective here is to leverage our expertise in CRC screening intervention research, implementation science, stakeholder engagement, and modeling to achieve this goal for our state. Our central hypothesis is that a pragmatic trial assessing impacts and costs for combinations of these evidence-based interventions (EBIs) will yield one or more strategies that stakeholders find to be cost-effective and sustainable. The specific aims for our study are: Aim 1 (Planning and Exploratory Phase): Pilot test a multilevel intervention to increase CRC screening in vulnerable populations in three NC regions. In this phase, we will complete pilot studies needed for our signature trial, plan for implementation evaluation and sustainability, and develop a process for evaluating locally-developed innovative approaches for improving screening. Aim 2 (Implementation Phase): Building on Aim 1 findings, implement and evaluate multilevel CRC screening approaches in vulnerable populations in NC. In this phase, we will conduct our signature trial, assess implementation outcomes, evaluate the use of stakeholder-engaged modeling for sustaining and scaling the multilevel intervention, and select and evaluate locally-developed innovations for improving screening. This project is innovative in combining outreach and in-reach EBIs and in its use of stakeholder-engaged simulation modeling to inform sustainability. The proposed research is significant because it will have a substantial impact on CRC morbidity, mortality, and disparities in vulnerable communities.",2018-09-30T12:09:00Z,2019-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-17-038,nofo_CA-17-038,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,CHAPEL HILL,NC,UNITED STATES,accsis
UG3CA233282,(ACCSIS) Accelerating Colorectal Cancer Screening through Implementation Science in Appalachia,"Accelerating Colorectal Cancer Screening through Implementation Science in Appalachia This multi-site project aims to increase screening and follow-up for colorectal cancer (CRC) in central Appalachia, a medically underserved region recognized as one of three distinct “hotspots” for CRC mortality. Specifically, the Appalachian Regional Commission classifies 32 eastern Ohio (OH) counties and the 54 counties in eastern Kentucky (KY) as north central and central Appalachia, respectively. CRC incidence and mortality rates in the area are among the highest in the nation, and neither state meets the national target of 80% of eligible residents screened for CRC. There have been few randomized intervention trials addressing multiple levels of influence on CRC screening behaviors and outcomes in this region. To address this gap, investigators at the University of Kentucky and The Ohio State University will build on a 12-year collaborative history, strong relationships with Appalachian communities and health clinics, and extensive experience with community-based cancer prevention and control intervention research to develop, implement, and evaluate a multilevel intervention (MLI) – adapted from evidence-based interventions that include components targeting clinics and providers (in-reach) and the community (outreach) – to increase CRC screening, follow-up and referral-to-care among patients age 50-74 in 12 counties in Appalachian KY and OH. The overall goals of this project are to contribute to the evidence-base for a MLI that increases rates of CRC screening, follow-up, and referral-to-care, particularly in rural, medically underserved populations, and help showcase best practices for how MLIs can be scaled-up to reduce the burden of CRC in the U.S. For the Planning-Exploratory Phase (UG3) in Year 1, our specific aims are to: 1) Pilot test, measure, and refine a MLI to increase rates of CRC screening, follow-up and referral-to-care in Appalachian OH and Appalachian KY; and 2) Provide evidence supporting transition to the Implementation Phase (UH3) [per NCI approval]. For the Implementation Phase (UH4) in Years 2-5, our specific aims are to: 1) Test the revised MLI in a group randomized trial, delayed intervention to assess the impact of the MLI on increasing rates of CRC screening, follow-up, and referral-to-care among Appalachian KY and Appalachian OH populations; and 2) Assess dissemination and sustainability of the intervention. The project will be implemented in collaboration with community and clinical partners in 12 counties, 6 in Ohio and 6 in Kentucky. Counties will be randomized to early or delayed intervention after baseline data collection. The main outcome will be CRC screening as defined by US Preventive Services Task Force guidelines and measured by clinic electronic health records and county- level behavioral assessments using random digit dialed telephone surveys similar to CDC’s Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. Our work will be accomplished through collaboration with the ACCSIS Coordinating Center, other ACCSIS Research Projects, ACCSIS Steering Committee and Workgroups, NCI, and community partners.

UG3CA233314,CRC-HUB-SPOKE: A ColoRectal Cancer screening Hub for Southern California community health centers.,"ABSTRACT Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening and appropriate follow-up can reduce incidence and mortality. The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends CRC screening through a variety of invasive and non- invasive tests for individuals aged 50 to 75 years. Evidence-based interventions (EBIs) and other strategies exist to promote CRC screening, but adoption and implementation of these are limited, especially in CHCs. Our hypothesis is that a Hub and Spoke multilevel intervention will be superior to usual care. The hub will be Health Quality Partners of Southern California (HQP), a non-profit organization comprised of 16 CHC systems (spokes), serving 135 rural and urban clinic sites. We propose a 2-phase study to pilot and optimize (Phase I) and rigorously test (Phase II) the Hub and Spoke approach and its impact on CRC screening, follow-up, and usual care. UG3 Planning/Exploratory Phase AIM: Pilot test the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary outcomes of a multilevel intervention for CRC screening, follow-up, and referral-to-care using a mixed methods approach. The intervention includes HQP hub-based delivery of centralized mailed FIT to patients served by individual CHCs-spokes plus complimentary provider and clinic-level interventions at CHCs, and coordination of a standardized navigation strategy delivered by CHCs for abnormal FIT follow-up. UH3 Implementation Phase. We will conduct a 2-arm pragmatic randomized trial to assess impact of a regionally-developed multilevel intervention to increase CRC screening, follow-up, and referral-to-care among CHC patients. The trial will be guided by the Pragmatic, Robust Implementation and Sustainability Model (PRISM), which includes outcomes from the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework and expands them with contextual constructs. Aim 1. Assess effectiveness of the multilevel intervention based on: 1) improvement in proportion up-to-date with screening 3 years post implementation; 2) proportion with abnormal FIT who complete diagnostic colonoscopy within 6 months; and 3) proportion with CRC completing first treatment evaluation. Aim 2. Evaluate the implementation, scalability, and sustainability of a multilevel implementation strategy. Implementation will be evaluated with a mixed methods approach using the RE-AIM outcomes of Reach, Adoption, and Implementation as well as the PRISM constructs of Intervention Characteristics and Recipients from perspective of multiple stakeholders (i.e. patients, front-line staff, and operational leaders). We will also calculate replication costs. Scalability and Sustainability will be evaluated using the RE-AIM outcome of Maintenance and the PRISM constructs of Implementation & Sustainability Infrastructure and External Environment. Our study will help accelerate progress in CRC prevention in underserved populations by identifying multilevel intervention strategies that are scalable to additional CHCs in the region, with potential for larger scale implementation.",2019-09-19T12:09:00Z,2020-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-19-018,nofo_CA-19-018,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",LA JOLLA,CA,UNITED STATES,accsis

Specifically, we aim to improve CRC screening rates, follow-up colonoscopy, and referral to care in rural Medicaid patients by implementing a direct mail fecal testing program with targeted outreach and patient navigation for follow-up colonoscopy. We leverage partnerships with the Oregon Rural Practice-based Research Network (ORPRN), Kaiser Northwest Center for Health Research, and Medicaid Health Plans and deliver training and implementation support to participating rural primary care clinics using practice facilitation. In total, we anticipate working with 30 organizations to facilitate implementation with 130 primary care clinics (reaching 17,000+ rural Medicaid patients). In Phase I (Year 01), we will conduct a milestone driven pilot to build the necessary infrastructure for a large-scale implementation-effectiveness trial, including adapting the clinic-health plan-vendor supported direct mail program for rural Medicaid patients that have not established care and/or never been screened; conducting a pilot study testing the feasibility and acceptability of patient navigation to support follow-up colonoscopy following an abnormal fecal test; engaging Medicaid Health Plans and recruiting 30 primary care clinics located in rural and frontier counties in Oregon; and developing the training and support materials needed to implement a large-scale trial in these settings. In Phase II (Years 02-05), we will conduct an implementation-effectiveness study using a quasi- experimental stepped wedge design in 30 rural primary care clinics using program training and practice facilitation to support implementation. As in the pilot, the intervention combines: (1) a clinic-health plan- vendor supported direct-mail fecal testing program with targeted outreach for patients who have never been screened or who have yet to establish care and (2) patient navigation for those who are referred for colonoscopy as either the primary screening or for follow-up from an abnormal fecal test. We will evaluate effectiveness, implementation, and maintenance of the intervention through quantitative and qualitative measures. Results from the implementation study will inform scale-up of the program through partnerships with 20 regional and national organizations that serve rural/frontier primary care clinics using webinars, train-the-trainer workshops and collaborative learning activities using the ECHO (Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes) model.",2019-09-23T12:09:00Z,2020-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-19-018,nofo_CA-19-018,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,PORTLAND,OR,UNITED STATES,accsis
UG3CA244687,Recurrent Tumor-Specific Alternately Processed Transcripts as a Source of Neoantigens for NF1-associated Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumor Immunoprevention,"Abstract/Summary Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) syndrome is an autosomal dominant tumor predisposition syndrome that is caused by loss-of-function mutations of NF1 gene encoding neurofibromin. Among patients with NF1, loss of the non-mutant allele of NF1 in a rare Schwann cell or precursor, along with other ill-defined factors, leads to benign dermal or plexiform neurofibromas. The main cause of death among NF1 patients is the malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST), a highly aggressive soft tissue sarcoma that most likely develops from plexiform neurofibroma, in particular the so-called “atypical” plexiform neurofibroma. Approximately half of MPNSTs are NF1-associated, and NF1 patients have 10-15% lifetime risk of developing this terrible cancer. MPNSTs metastasize early and are often resistant to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The main treatment for MPNSTs is surgical resection but, despite radical excision with wide surgical margins, followed by chemoradiation, 5-year survival rates are poor due to metastases as well as local recurrence. NF1 patients could greatly benefit from prophylactic vaccination that would prevent the malignant transformation of benign plexiform neurofibromas into “atypical” plexiform neurofibromas and to MPNSTs. We aim to determine if the mutations that govern the development of “atypical” plexiform neurofibroma (NF1 loss followed by CDKN2A loss) and MPSNT (NF1, CDKN2A, and SUZ12 loss) lead to the expression of recurrent alternately processed transcripts, such as transcriptionally-induced chimeras, that could express neoantigens and be used as targets for prophylactic vaccines. Such transcripts can be translated to produce novel peptides downstream of frameshift mutations caused by coding exon read-through into introns, mis-splicing from a coding exon to a non-canonical splice acceptors or splice acceptors in other genes. In most cases, a premature termination codon (PTC) will be rapidly encountered by the ribosome translating such transcripts. Therefore, we furthermore hypothesize that these alternately processed transcripts can express what we call “cryptic” neoantigens when treated with drugs that suppress utilization of premature codons such as Ataluren or gentamycin. In such a way, we could administer a prophylactic vaccine and induce conditionally active immune response that would eliminate nascent tumors only when drug treatment is used.",2019-09-25T12:09:00Z,2021-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-19-012,nofo_RFA-CA-19-012,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,MINNEAPOLIS,MN,UNITED STATES,iotn
UG3CA244697,Intercepting progression from pre-invasive to invasive lung adenocarcinoma,"Abstract Despite advances in therapeutic strategies, non-small cell lung cancer remains a deadly disease. An improved understanding of the biology of lung cancer is needed to intercept the disease at an early point in its progression. Our project, which is inspired by that challenge, focuses on events transpiring in the earliest radiographically-detected manifestation of lung cancer: the computerized tomography (CT)-detected non- solid nodule, of which as many as 40% harbor frankly invasive adenocarcinoma. Thus, despite conventional wisdom that CT-detected non-solid nodules represent pre or minimally invasive malignancy, clearly transition to more invasive histologies occurs in a significant proportion of these nodules. Understanding the cellular and molecular changes within non-solid nodules that drive progression will provide unique and novel insights into the fundamental mechanisms of lung carcinogenesis. We hypothesize that alterations in cells of the tumor microenvironment (TME) have a role in initiating and supporting this progression. In agreement with that proposal, our preliminary multiplex immunofluorescence (IF) studies suggest that progression to a more invasive phenotype is associated with the development of a strong immunosuppressive TME. In this project we test our hypothesis using multidimensional methods to profile the TME and to determine the crosstalk between cancer cells and the TME in pre-invasive to invasive human lung non-solid adenocarcinomas. Comparative analysis of the cellular and molecular events associated with the distinct histological stages will lead to identification of the critical events triggering progression and thereby identify targets to intercept disease progression. We will use appropriate mouse models in pre-clinical studies to develop these targets as strategies to intercept progression of pre-invasive to invasive cancer. In the first phase of these studies (UG3 phase), we will define TME alterations associated with progression of lung nodules using RNAseq profiling and image-based methods (multiplex IF and imaging CyTOF) in studies of our archival tumor samples. These studies will generate a comprehensive catalogue of the cellular and molecular events that trigger progression of indolent lesions to frankly invasive cancers, with a strong focus on immune mechanisms. These analyses will provide novel and detailed insights into how the composition and activity of the TME changes with progression. In the second phase (UH3 phase), we will leverage mouse models to explore interception strategies to target immune mechanisms and prevent progression. The proposed cohort satisfies the RFA’s focus on High-Risk Cohorts for Cancer-Immunoprevention Studies, since lung nodules are premalignancies highly prevalent in smokers.",2019-09-25T12:09:00Z,2021-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-19-012,nofo_RFA-CA-19-012,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,NEW YORK,NY,UNITED STATES,iotn
UH2CA263954,Imaging the native 3D architecture of pancreatic and breast tumor patient tissue at single-cell resolution,"PROJECT SUMMARY Cancer remains the second-leading cause of adult death in the United States, yet the mechanisms by which cancerous growths are initiated and how crucial transitions such as metastasis and therapeutic resistance occur are not well understood. Significant progress has been made in the multiplexed analysis of solid tumors through the use of single-cell sequencing and spatio-molecular mapping techniques. However, despite the unique insights into tumor heterogeneity these methods have afforded, they are limited to two-dimensional (2D) thin analyses which provide little information on the native three-dimensional architecture of the tumor. Serial reconstruction can provide some three-dimensional context, but such approaches are both inefficient in terms of sample throughput and are inherently destructive to the tissue architecture. We propose a cross-disciplinary, approach to quantitatively characterize the native three-dimensional architecture of human solid tumor tissue from triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients using a combination of the state-of-the art, yet mature technologies of tissue clearing, immunofluorescence and in situ hybridization labeling, and high-resolution lightsheet fluorescence microscopy. Analysis of these tissue volumes will enable the elucidation of the spatial interactome of different tumor, immune and stromal cells that give rise to tumor heterogeneity as well as their interactions with components of the tumor microenvironment. Our Specific Aims are (1) to image the three-dimensional spatial distribution of tumor, immune and stromal cells in relation to vasculature, lymphatics and the extracellular matrix in native solid tumor tissue from human pancreatic and breast malignancies using a combination of tissue clearing, immunofluorescence, in situ hybridization and 3D lightsheet microscopy, and (2) to develop a computational pipeline to build three-dimensional spatial maps of protein expression and RNA transcript localization in intact solid tumor tissue from human pancreatic and breast malignancies. The innovation of the proposed work lies in our cross-disciplinary strategy of combining the cutting- edge tissue clearing, multiplexed labelling and high-resolution lightsheet microscopy to better understand the native three-dimensional architecture of solid tumors. Specifically, by classifying and quantitating previously unknown three-dimensional features of solid tumor tissue we will be able to relate the spatial organization of the tumor to genomic and proteomic data taken from the same specimen. The significance of this proposal is that successful three-dimensional characterization of human tumor tissues will enable key insights to be derived on both intra- and inter-tumor heterogeneity thus facilitating the identification of cell-cell and cell-microenvironment interactions that could serve as potential therapeutic targets thus providing new routes to treatments to decrease patient mortality and improve quality of life.",2021-08-03T12:08:00Z,2024-07-31T12:07:00Z,RFA-CA-20-042,nofo_RFA-CA-20-042,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,SAINT LOUIS,MO,UNITED STATES,htan
UH3CA233229,ACCISIS-Chicago,"PROJECT SUMMARY Screening for colorectal cancer (CRC) not only detects disease early but also prevents cancer by finding and removing precancerous polyps. The overall goal of our project, Accelerating Colorectal Cancer Screening and Follow-up through Implementation Science in Chicago (ACCSIS-Chicago), is to test a multilevel, multicomponent intervention to increase rates of CRC screening, follow-up, and referral-to-care among racial/ethnic minority and low income populations in Chicago, Illinois. In this project, we will include two different types of implementation strategies: 1) evidence-based multilevel, multicomponent intervention to increase rates of CRC screening, follow-up, and referral-to-care; and 2) implementation support strategies to support the implementation process that contribute to the adoption, implementation and sustainment of our proposed multilevel, multicomponent intervention. We will partner with 4 federally qualified health centers (FQHCs), which have 35 clinics in the Chicago area and provided primary care service to nearly 188,000 racial/ethnic minority and low income populations in 2016. During the UG3 Planning-Exploratory Phase, we will work with one of the 4 FQHC partners to pilot test, measure, and refine our proposed multilevel, multicomponent intervention in preparation for the experimental trial in the UH3 Implementation Phase, as well as assess the effectiveness of our implementation support strategies. In the UH3 Implementation Phase, we will use a stepped wedge cluster randomized trial design to examine the effectiveness and impact of our multilevel, multicomponent intervention on increasing rates of CRC screening, follow-up, and referral-to-care across our 4 partner FQHCs. The selection of our intervention components will be based on intensive literature review, and findings and lessons learned from our previous studies and projects. Our multilevel intervention components will include EMR provider reminders, provider assessment and feedback, patient navigation, provider education and community outreach. We will also test one local innovation, IL ColonCARES, during the UGH Phase to increase the rate of follow-up after a positive stool test among uninsured patients by linking uninsured patients with specialty services. We expect the finding from this study to have broad impact on understanding the implementation process to increase colorectal cancer screening, follow up, and referral to care across diverse health systems.",2018-09-21T12:09:00Z,2024-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-17-038,nofo_CA-17-038,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,CHICAGO,IL,UNITED STATES,accsis
UH3CA233251,"Scaling Colorectal Cancer Screening Through Outreach, Referral, and Engagement (SCORE): A State-Level Program to Reduce Colorectal Cancer Burden in Vulnerable Populations","Modified Project Summary/Abstract Section PROJECT SUMMARY Despite strong evidence that colorectal cancer (CRC) screening reduces mortality, rates of CRC screening, follow-up, and referral-to-care (herein referred to as “CRC screening”) remain suboptimal in the US. In North Carolina (NC), underuse of screening contributes to particularly high CRC burden in certain regions. Community health centers (CHCs) play a critical role in providing CRC screening for these vulnerable populations. Yet, CRC screening rates in NC CHCs are well below the estimated national rate of 62%. Substantial efforts are needed to reach the national target of 80%. Because multiple patient-, provider-, and system-level factors contribute to low screening rates, multilevel interventions are needed to achieve screening targets. Accumulating evidence shows that interventions involving mailed screening outreach, practice-based screening in-reach (using patient navigators), and systematically improving colonoscopy access, all increase screening. However, in practice, CHCs face substantial resource limitations and lack the means to systematically implement a multi-level intervention of outreach, in-reach, and improved colonoscopy access for uninsured patients. Until a multi-level intervention is shown to be both effective and cost-effective from stakeholder perspectives, screening rates will remain low, leaving thousands of vulnerable patients at risk. We hypothesize that standardizing these interventions for CHCs at the state-level will yield cost-effective approaches to increasing screening. Our long-term goal is to reduce CRC burden and disparities through improved screening. Our objective here is to leverage our expertise in CRC screening intervention research, implementation science, stakeholder engagement, and modeling to achieve this goal for our state. Our central hypothesis is that a pragmatic trial assessing impacts and costs for combinations of these evidence-based interventions (EBIs) will yield one or more strategies that stakeholders find to be cost-effective and sustainable. The specific aims for our study are: Aim 1 (Planning and Exploratory Phase): Pilot test a multilevel intervention to increase CRC screening in vulnerable populations in three NC regions. In this phase, we will complete pilot studies needed for our signature trial, plan for implementation evaluation and sustainability, and develop a process for evaluating locally-developed innovative approaches for improving screening. Aim 2 (Implementation Phase): Building on Aim 1 findings, implement and evaluate multilevel CRC screening approaches in vulnerable populations in NC. In this phase, we will conduct our signature trial, assess implementation outcomes, evaluate the use of stakeholder-engaged modeling for sustaining and scaling the multilevel intervention, and select and evaluate locally-developed innovations for improving screening. This project is innovative in combining outreach and in-reach EBIs and in its use of stakeholder-engaged simulation modeling to inform sustainability. The proposed research is significant because it will have a substantial impact on CRC morbidity, mortality, and disparities in vulnerable communities.",2018-09-30T12:09:00Z,2024-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-17-038,nofo_CA-17-038,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,CHAPEL HILL,NC,UNITED STATES,accsis
UH3CA233282,(ACCSIS) Accelerating Colorectal Cancer Screening through Implementation Science in Appalachia,"Modified Project Summary/Abstract Section This multi-site project aims to increase screening and follow-up for colorectal cancer (CRC) in central Appalachia, a medically underserved region recognized as one of three distinct “hotspots” for CRC mortality. Specifically, the Appalachian Regional Commission classifies 32 eastern Ohio (OH) counties and the 54 counties in eastern Kentucky (KY) as north central and central Appalachia, respectively. CRC incidence and mortality rates in the area are among the highest in the nation, and neither state meets the national target of 80% of eligible residents screened for CRC. There have been few randomized intervention trials addressing multiple levels of influence on CRC screening behaviors and outcomes in this region. To address this gap, investigators at the University of Kentucky and The Ohio State University will build on a 12-year collaborative history, strong relationships with Appalachian communities and health clinics, and extensive experience with community-based cancer prevention and control intervention research to develop, implement, and evaluate a multilevel intervention (MLI) – adapted from evidence-based interventions that include components targeting clinics and providers (in-reach) and the community (outreach) – to increase CRC screening, follow-up and referral-to-care among patients age 50-74 in 12 counties in Appalachian KY and OH. The overall goals of this project are to contribute to the evidence-base for a MLI that increases rates of CRC screening, follow-up, and referral-to-care, particularly in rural, medically underserved populations, and help showcase best practices for how MLIs can be scaled-up to reduce the burden of CRC in the U.S. For the Planning-Exploratory Phase (UG3) in Year 1, our specific aims are to: 1) Pilot test, measure, and refine a MLI to increase rates of CRC screening, follow-up and referral-to-care in Appalachian OH and Appalachian KY; and 2) Provide evidence supporting transition to the Implementation Phase (UH3) [per NCI approval]. For the Implementation Phase (UH4) in Years 2-5, our specific aims are to: 1) Test the revised MLI in a group randomized trial, delayed intervention to assess the impact of the MLI on increasing rates of CRC screening, follow-up, and referral-to-care among Appalachian KY and Appalachian OH populations; and 2) Assess dissemination and sustainability of the intervention. The project will be implemented in collaboration with community and clinical partners in 12 counties, 6 in Ohio and 6 in Kentucky. Counties will be randomized to early or delayed intervention after baseline data collection. The main outcome will be CRC screening as defined by US Preventive Services Task Force guidelines and measured by clinic electronic health records and county- level behavioral assessments using random digit dialed telephone surveys similar to CDC’s Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. Our work will be accomplished through collaboration with the ACCSIS Coordinating Center, other ACCSIS Research Projects, ACCSIS Steering Committee and Workgroups, NCI, and community partners. If effective, this MLI will be disseminated to our clinical and community partners throughout Appalachia.",2018-09-19T12:09:00Z,2024-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-17-038,nofo_CA-17-038,UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY,LEXINGTON,KY,UNITED STATES,accsis
UH3CA233314,CRC-HUB-SPOKE: A ColoRectal Cancer screening Hub for Southern California community health centers.,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening and appropriate follow-up can reduce incidence and mortality. The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends CRC screening through a variety of invasive and non-invasive tests for individuals aged 50 to 75 years. Evidence-based interventions (EBIs) and other strategies exist to promote CRC screening, but adoption and implementation of these are limited, especially in CHCs. Our hypothesis is that a Hub and Spoke multilevel intervention will be superior to usual care. The hub will be Health Quality Partners of Southern California (HQP), a non-profit organization comprised of 16 CHC systems (spokes), serving 135 rural and urban clinic sites. We propose a 2-phase study to pilot and optimize (Phase I) and rigorously test (Phase II) the Hub and Spoke approach and its impact on CRC screening, follow-up, and usual care. UG3 Planning/Exploratory Phase AIM: Pilot test the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary outcomes of a multilevel intervention for CRC screening, follow-up, and referral-to-care using a mixed methods approach. The intervention includes HQP hub-based delivery of centralized mailed FIT to patients served by individual CHCs-spokes plus complimentary provider and clinic-level interventions at CHCs, and coordination of a standardized navigation strategy delivered by CHCs for abnormal FIT follow-up. UH3 Implementation Phase. We will conduct a 2-arm pragmatic randomized trial to assess impact of a regionally-developed multilevel intervention to increase CRC screening, follow-up, and referral-to-care among CHC patients. The trial will be guided by the Pragmatic, Robust Implementation and Sustainability Model (PRISM), which includes outcomes from the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework and expands them with contextual constructs. Aim 1. Assess effectiveness of the multilevel intervention based on: 1) improvement in proportion up-to-date with screening 3 years post implementation; 2) proportion with abnormal FIT who complete diagnostic colonoscopy within 6 months; and 3) proportion with CRC completing first treatment evaluation. Aim 2. Evaluate the implementation, scalability, and sustainability of a multilevel implementation strategy. Implementation will be evaluated with a mixed methods approach using the RE-AIM outcomes of Reach, Adoption, and Implementation as well as the PRISM constructs of Intervention Characteristics and Recipients from perspective of multiple stakeholders (i.e. patients, front-line staff, and operational leaders). We will also calculate replication costs. Scalability and Sustainability will be evaluated using the RE-AIM outcome of Maintenance and the PRISM constructs of Implementation & Sustainability Infrastructure and External Environment. Our study will help accelerate progress in CRC prevention in underserved populations by identifying multilevel intervention strategies that are scalable to additional CHCs in the region, with potential for larger scale implementation.",2019-09-19T12:09:00Z,2024-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-19-018,nofo_CA-19-018,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",LA JOLLA,CA,UNITED STATES,accsis
UH3CA244298,Screening More patients for CRC through Adapting and Refining Targeted Evidence-based Interventions in Rural settings (SMARTER CRC),"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: This two-phase project is designed to achieve the Cancer Moonshot objectives by reducing the burden of CRC on the US population. Specifically, we aim to improve CRC screening rates, follow-up colonoscopy, and referral to care in rural Medicaid patients by implementing a direct mail fecal testing program with targeted outreach and patient navigation for follow-up colonoscopy. We leverage partnerships with the Oregon Rural Practice-based Research Network (ORPRN), Kaiser Northwest Center for Health Research, and Medicaid Health Plans and deliver training and implementation support to participating rural primary care clinics using practice facilitation. In total, we anticipate working with 30 organizations to facilitate implementation with 130 primary care clinics (reaching 17,000+ rural Medicaid patients). In Phase I (Year 01), we will conduct a milestone driven pilot to build the necessary infrastructure for a large-scale implementation-effectiveness trial, including adapting the clinic-health plan-vendor supported direct mail program for rural Medicaid patients that have not established care and/or never been screened; conducting a pilot study testing the feasibility and acceptability of patient navigation to support follow-up colonoscopy following an abnormal fecal test; engaging Medicaid Health Plans and recruiting 30 primary care clinics located in rural and frontier counties in Oregon; and developing the training and support materials needed to implement a large-scale trial in these settings. In Phase II (Years 02-05), we will conduct an implementation-effectiveness study using a quasi- experimental stepped wedge design in 30 rural primary care clinics using program training and practice facilitation to support implementation. As in the pilot, the intervention combines: (1) a clinic-health plan- vendor supported direct-mail fecal testing program with targeted outreach for patients who have never been screened or who have yet to establish care and (2) patient navigation for those who are referred for colonoscopy as either the primary screening or for follow-up from an abnormal fecal test. We will evaluate effectiveness, implementation, and maintenance of the intervention through quantitative and qualitative measures. Results from the implementation study will inform scale-up of the program through partnerships with 20 regional and national organizations that serve rural/frontier primary care clinics using webinars, train-the-trainer workshops and collaborative learning activities using the ECHO (Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes) model.",2019-09-23T12:09:00Z,2024-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-19-018,nofo_CA-19-018,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,PORTLAND,OR,UNITED STATES,accsis
UH3CA244687,Recurrent Tumor-Specific Alternately Processed Transcripts as a Source of Neoantigens for NF1-associated Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumor Immunoprevention,"Abstract/Summary Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) syndrome is an autosomal dominant tumor predisposition syndrome that is caused by loss-of-function mutations of NF1 gene encoding neurofibromin. Among patients with NF1, loss of the non-mutant allele of NF1 in a rare Schwann cell or precursor, along with other ill-defined factors, leads to benign dermal or plexiform neurofibromas. The main cause of death among NF1 patients is the malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST), a highly aggressive soft tissue sarcoma that most likely develops from plexiform neurofibroma, in particular the so-called “atypical” plexiform neurofibroma. Approximately half of MPNSTs are NF1-associated, and NF1 patients have 10-15% lifetime risk of developing this terrible cancer.

UM1CA181255,AIDS and Cancer Specimen Resource (ACSR),"Abstract The AIDS epidemic, initially recognized in the early 1980's, currently affects more than 35 million people worldwide. Infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is associated with a wide range of long term health complications including the development of cancer, currently a major cause of death among persons living with HIV/AIDS. The early form of the AIDS and Cancer Specimen Resource (ACSR) was established in 1994 as a cooperative agreement with the NCI with a mission to provide high quality biospecimens to researchers, a mission still paramount for the current ACSR. Principle investigators (MPIs) from the two legacy sites (GWU and UCSF) oversee the function of the ACSR to ensure the adherence to NCI best practices in this multinational program. The ACSR is currently the custodian for specimen collections from more than 20,000 individuals and makes these biospecimens available to eligible researchers studying HIV and cancer through an established specimen application process. In the past five years, investigators from more than 50 institutions have received research material from the ACSR. In addition, the ACSR has provided the centralized biospecimen collection and distribution functions for the AIDS Malignancy Consortium (AMC), which represents the NCI-funded international network of more than 30 clinical institutions involved in testing novel cancer therapies in HIV-infected individuals. The ACSR is structured into regional biospecimen repositories (RBRs) located in distinct geographical regions that reflect the US and global HIV epidemic and are unified (virtually) by an informatics infrastructure managed by the Hub for Integrated Informatics and Research Support (HIIRS). The RBRs are distinct but complementary in their diverse functions, with collaborative interactions fostered through the Governing Committee and ACSR-wide Working Groups that accomplish activities related to Science and Technology, Marketing and Outreach, Informatics, and Quality Management. As the HIV epidemic has evolved the types of cancers and the technologies used to study them have also changed. The newly reconfigured ACSR will have two divisions, both focused on obtaining the most important well-annotated (demographic, clinical, pathological and outcomes data) biospecimens for research as defined by investigator inquiries and the ACSR's scientific advisory board. The two MPIs, respectively will head the national and international AMC support program and the scientific direction of the ACSR. Both MPIs will work within the structure of the ACSR to obtain and provide to researcher's specimens most important for research in the current epidemic. Specific Aims include: 1) Acquire, store, and equitably distribute tumor tissues and biological fluids from individuals with HIV-associated malignancies (AIDS-defining cancers and non-AIDS defining cancers) to meet the biospecimen needs of researchers in HIV-associated malignancies; and 2) Promote the success of AMC clinical trials through mutually beneficial collaborations.",2013-09-23T12:09:00Z,2024-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-18-012,nofo_RFA-CA-18-012,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,WASHINGTON,DC,UNITED STATES,acsr
UM1CA186644,North American Star Consortium,"This UM1 renewal application is designated the North American Star Consortium (NASC), which includes Moffitt Cancer Center (MCC) as the Lead Academic Organization (LAO) with Daniel Sullivan, MD as the contact PI. MCC is joined by four highly productive Academic Organizations (AO) including Princess Margaret Cancer Center (PMCC; Philippe Bedard, MD, multi-PI), Virginia Commonwealth University-Massey Cancer Center (VCU-Massey; Steven Grant, MD, multi-PI), University of Texas Southwestern Simmons Cancer Center (UTSW; Muhammad Beg, MD, multi-PI), and Northwestern Lurie Cancer Center (NWU; Jeffrey Sosman, MD, multi-PI). The NASC evolved from the Princess Margaret Phase 1 Consortium (PMP1C), where PMCC was the LAO and MCC and VCU-Massey AOs. The two new sites (UTSW and NWU) bring additional depth in basic/translational science and biomarker (BM) development, have active early phase clinical trial programs, prioritize the accrual of minority patients, have active mentorship programs for Early Career Clinical Investigators (ECIs), and expand the NASC expertise in investigational imaging. The PMP1C has existed from April 2014 to the present and during this time 14 ETCTN trials have been activated and 4 are pending activation. The average yearly accrual during this time was 52 patients/year (yearly goal was 50 patients/year), with 97 patients enrolled March 2018 – February 2019. The 5 NASC institutions have enrolled a total of 1703 patients on their “top 50 trials” (ETCTN + non-ETCTN) with appropriate minority patient accrual, exceptionally strong mentoring of ECIs, and significant correlative molecular analyses for integrated and exploratory BM.

UM1CA186686,NCI Experimental Therapeutics-Clinical Trials Network with Phase 1 Emphasis,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We will conduct Phase I clinical trials of new anticancer agents or combinations of anticancer agents to characterize drug toxicity, determine the maximum tolerated dose, evaluate the pharmacokinetics, perform pharmacogenetic analysis, and relating clinical endpoints to pharmacokinetics, pharmacogenetics, and/or biologic endpoints. A major focus of this proposal is the study agents that interact with novel targets such as signal transduction pathways, cell cycle checkpoint components, DNA repair pathways and apoptosis regulators, either alone or in combination with standard chemotherapy. The endpoints for the evaluation of such treatments will be clinical effect (toxicity and antineoplasti response) as well as alterations in biochemical pathways affected in preclinical model systems. The specific aims of these studies are: to determine as efficiently as compatible with patient safety the appropriate dose of new anticancer agents selected by the National Cancer Institute using novel trial designs including accelerated titration, Bayesian design, and other advanced design schemes; to identify clinical, pharmacokinetic, or other laboratory parameters that may predict toxicity; to determine whether functional polymorphisms of drug metabolizing or other enzymes associated with drug response alter pharmacokinetics, toxicity and/or activity of agents being studied; to obtain mechanistic proof-of-principle data for new agents directed at novel molecular cancer targets when appropriate; to evaluate translational endpoints in clinical trials o investigational agents such as, levels of expression and/or activity of molecular targets and/or downstream effectors pertinent to a given agent or pathway modulated by the agent under study; to identify potential biomarkers (with particular emphasis where possible on genomics and imaging) that may serve as predictors of outcome in later phase trials; to translate novel discoveries from R0l, SPORE, or other peer reviewed mechanisms into clinical trials that leverage the scientific community expertise with a team science approach. Studies will be designed to incorporate the appropriate pharmacokinetic and pharmacogenetic analysis, drug analysis, and biological analysis of drug effects on the intended target or pathway. RELEVANCE: The Mayo Clinic Cancer Center and University of Maryland Greenebaum Cancer Center provides an exceptional environment to perform early phase trials in a diverse population.

We propose to advance the development of novel therapeutics using precision oncology approaches and rationally designed clinical trials. The long-term objective is to provide the ETCTN with the joint expertise of the faculty from the four member institutions, expediting translating preclinical discoveries to the clinic, and to provide significant scientific and administrative leadership to the ETCTN. Our hypothesis for the optimal development of novel targeted agents includes testing within a molecularly profiled population, integrating pharmacodynamics markers in early clinical trials and programmatic assessment of predictors of intrinsic sensitivity/resistance and mechanisms of acquired resistance. We are proposing to achieve these goals through the following five specific aims: 1) To study, in an efficient, systematic and collaborative manner, the safety and clinical activity of new agents or hypothesis-driven novel combinations. 2) To molecularly profile tumors and patients (host tissues), to optimize selection of potentially relevant therapies based on the molecular aberrations identified in the tumor and immune environment, where appropriate. 3) To develop and validate clinically relevant of predictors and pharmacodynamic markers of response. 4) To mentor early career faculty, trainees and research personnel in the leadership, conduct, analysis, and reporting of ETCTN trials. 5) To provide scientific and administrative leadership within ETCTN. The TEX-CTN will unite four University of Texas institutions to facilitate access to novel therapies and biomarker-driven trials across the network, for patients with rare as well as common tumors, as well as patients from underserved minority populations. Our team consists of internationally recognized leaders of Phase I and II trials, multidisciplinary disease experts, interventional radiologists, translational pathologists, and diagnostic radiologists.

UM1CA186689,VICKtOrY Early Clinical Trials Consortium,"The new era in cancer drug development represents a paradigm shift in how early phase studies are conducted relative to the “conventional” approach of treating without consideration to underlying tumor genomics, biology and immunology. Translational endpoints, including levels of target expression, engagement, and modulation of downstream effectors are being assessed as early as possible, and increasing emphasis is being placed on early patient selection, utilizing novel biomarker assays and molecular characterization to identify patients most likely to respond. The ultimate purpose of the NCI Experimental Therapeutics-Clinical Trials Network (ETCTN) is to develop new therapeutic options while also defining better approaches for the development of novel anticancer agents that capitalize on the ability to characterize tumors molecularly and by also finding appropriate biomarkers to select patients most likely to respond. As biomarker-driven trials become the cornerstone of early phase investigation, allowing for the study of potential mechanisms of response and resistance, incorporation of these biomarkers is lending itself to novel trial designs which incorporate fewer, and often rarer patient subsets, defining greater patient outcomes with smaller recruited populations. As a result, a unique network such as the ETCTN, consisting of multiple scientifically-driven sites and investigators with a vast array of expertise, is needed. The ETCTN allows investigators to test relevant bench-to-bedside findings, and through integrated analysis and the development of interdisciplinary teams, incorporates reverse translation to bring the bedside back to the bench. This application is a re-competition of our previous ETCTN UM1 award (1UM1CA186689), demonstrating both our progress over the past funding period as well as our capabilities to conduct early phase clinical trials. We have slightly amended our original partnerships which now include Vanderbilt-Ingram, University of California San Diego, Karmanos Cancer Institute, University of Oklahoma Stephenson Cancer Center (new) and the Yale Cancer Center (VICKtOrY). Our team aims to 1) leverage novel scientific discoveries for translation into early phase trials, using the CTEP pharmacopeia, in rare cancers, common cancers, and uncommon variants of common cancers; 2) incorporate serum, tissue and imaging biomarkers to better understand the effects of novel agents either alone or in combination; 3) train early career investigators to be knowledgeable and proficient in conducting early phase clinical trials by providing clinical research leadership opportunities and mentoring; and 4) include as a component of our early phase clinical trial recruitment, no less than 10% underserved/special populations. The members of our team have a unique set of complementary expertise and a similar philosophy regarding collaborative research and mentorship of the next generation of cancer investigators.

UM1CA186690,NCI ETCTN Pittsburgh Cancer Consortium (PCC),"Abstract For more than 40 years, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) has supported an infrastructure program to conduct clinical trials across the US. To enhance, facilitate, and expedite the process of early-phase drug development, the NCI implemented a comprehensive plan transforming the NCI-sponsored early-phase clinical trials program from a series of separate institutions and efforts to a new, consolidated, integrated program, referred to as the NCI Experimental Therapeutics Clinical Trials Network (ETCTN). The UPMC Hillman Cancer Center (formerly the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, hereafter referred to as ‘HCC’) has been an NCI-designated comprehensive cancer center since 1990, and has been involved in the NCI Early Drug Development Program since 1999. Our group was one of 12 academic centers to be selected as an ETCTN Lead Academic Organization (LAO) for the phase 1 component, and subsequently selected as one of 10 academic centers to integrate phase 2 clinical trial efforts, with responsibility for developing, leading, and accruing to ETCTN clinical trials for adult cancer patients. We now propose to be a member of the NCI ETCTN as the Pittsburgh Cancer Consortium (PCC) Lead Academic Organization in a consortium with the University of Florida Health Cancer Center and the Albert Einstein Cancer Center. The goal of the PCC is to create a unified, integrated clinical trials network that will allow for more seamless advancement and progress of novel experimental agents and/or combinations through early stages of drug development. The eventual goal of our program is to greatly facilitate and accelerate the delivery of new cancer therapies to the citizens of Pennsylvania, North-Central Florida, Bronx, NY, and their respective catchment areas.",2014-03-25T12:03:00Z,2026-02-28T12:02:00Z,RFA-CA-13-006;RFA-CA-15-501;RFA-CA-19-007,nofo_CA19-007,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,PITTSBURGH,PA,UNITED STATES,etctn

We propose to use the combined patient and scientific resources and expertise of UCD, COH, USC, and SCI to accomplish the following Specific Aims: (Aim 1) to use the existing relevant capabilities and scientific leadership of the CCC to enhance the ETCTN program; (Aim 2) to leverage the combined breadth of the clinical programs at COH, USC, UCD, and SCI NCI-Designated Comprehensive Cancer Centers to support the rapid completion of ETCTN trials; (Aim 3) to use the central Data Coordinating Center (DCC) and Biostatistics Core (BC) at COH to facilitate frequent communication within the CCC and with the NCI and ETCTN, provide rapid development and effective oversight of trials, and ensure adherence to policies and procedures; and (Aim 4) to optimize information gained from ETCTN clinical trials by including molecular characterization of patients’ malignancies and incorporating molecular pharmacodynamic endpoints and investigational imaging. These early phase studies will lead to recommended, biologically effective doses, greater understanding of the spectrum of normal tissue toxicity of agents, and initial estimates of efficacy. They will also provide mechanistic validation of the effects of the agents on critical tumor cell targets, correlate drug-related changes in tumor and host biologic markers with clinical outcome, and develop new insights into the therapeutic mechanisms of action of the compounds both in the laboratory and the clinic. As such, they will advance the ETCTN’s overall goal of accelerating the development of novel anticancer agents that capitalize on unique molecular features of individual tumors and identifying appropriate biomarkers to select patients who are most likely to respond to specific agents.",2014-03-28T12:03:00Z,2026-02-28T12:02:00Z,RFA-CA-13-006;RFA-CA-15-501;RFA-CA-19-007,nofo_CA19-007,BECKMAN RESEARCH INSTITUTE/CITY OF HOPE,DUARTE,CA,UNITED STATES,etctn
UM1CA221939,Center for Research to Optimize Precision Lung Cancer Screening in Diverse Populations,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Lung cancer, the most significant cause of cancer deaths in the US, is an urgent public health threat. It disproportionately affects populations that are already plagued by high poverty rates and low education levels. These populations experience both health disparities in the early diagnosis and treatment of cancer and are historically difficult to reach with cancer screening initiatives. While the results from the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) indicated that low dose CT (LDCT) is an efficacious and cost-effective strategy for lung cancer screening (LCS), many uncertainties exist with respect to how patient, provider, health system, and societal factors may impact the quality, compliance, effectiveness, and the risk of harms associated with lung cancer screening, within community-based health systems who serve diverse populations. Spanning from Pennsylvania to Hawaii and including five heterogeneous health systems with diverse populations, our proposed PROSPR Research Center, the Center for Research to Optimize Precision Lung Cancer Screening (CPLS), brings together a team of experienced, interdisciplinary researchers and clinicians with long-standing collaborative ties that is well-positioned to pursue research related to the barriers and opportunities associated with the implementation of LCS programs within community settings. The health systems within CPLS include: Henry Ford Health System in Metro Detroit, Kaiser Permanente Colorado, Kaiser Permanente Hawaii, Marshfield Clinic Health System in rural Wisconsin, and University of Pennsylvania Health System. The ultimate goal of CPLS is to identify critical gaps in the LCS process and to design innovative multilevel interventions to reduce lung cancer mortality, particularly among underserved populations. To achieve this goal, CPLS will complete the following specific aims: 1) build a comprehensive data ecosystem by pooling and linking common data elements to capture the entire LCS process and to assess the patient, provider, facility, health system, and societal factors that affect LCS; 2) leverage the CPLS data resource to conduct four high- impact, observational studies of the multilevel factors associated with the LCS process; 3) based on findings from Aims 1 and 2, develop and test interventions to address identifiable gaps in care that may lead to health disparities in LCS, 4) actively participate in Trans-PROSPR research initiatives and collaborate with external investigators via the use of publicly-available CPLS datasets. Our center focuses on the inclusion of diverse, underserved populations that are defined by multiple factors that may adversely impact access to, and utilization of, cancer screening. In response to both the Surgeon General’s strong emphasis on the need to reduce lung cancer mortality and the Cancer Moonshot Blue Ribbon Panel’s focus on reducing the disproportionately high cancer death rates in underserved populations, CPLS will serve as a model for high- impact, translational research to reduce disparities in cancer mortality.",2018-04-15T12:04:00Z,2024-03-31T12:03:00Z,RFA-CA-16-016,nofo_RFA-CA-16-016,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,Oakland,CA,UNITED STATES,prospr

As technology, guidelines, and policies change, our MultilEvel OpTimization of the CeRvIcal Cancer Screening Process in Diverse Settings & Populations (METRICS) PROSPR II Research Center will elucidate multilevel factors that hamper or facilitate the cervical cancer screening process and reduce disparities in vulnerable populations. METRICS unites three PROSPR I Research Centers with demonstrated capability to provide validated data for a combined cohort of ~1.2 million screened and unscreened women. Our community settings represent 3 care delivery models—safety-net system, managed care system, and primary care provider networks in Texas, Washington, and Massachusetts. We will collect, harmonize, and document > 10 years of high-quality, comprehensive cervical cancer screening process data at the patient, provider, clinic, and system levels using a rich array of electronic clinical information systems and novel data sources. Our combined cohort is socioeconomically and geographically diverse and includes vulnerable groups such as HIV-infected and uninsured women. Our three interconnected observational projects are designed to understand how cervical cancer screening is delivered across our spectrum of delivery models, and how to optimize the screening process to reduce disparities. Innovative geospatial and Bayesian statistical methods in Project 1 will better elucidate at what levels variation in screening process occurs. Project 2 will investigate how multilevel programs and policies influence adherence to guidelines for average-risk women. Project 3 will inform precision screening for women with altered risk. Based on our observational findings, in years 4-5, we will design and implement pilot interventions leveraging IT-enabled tools to address key failures in the screening process and reduce disparities. Our transdisciplinary team has epidemiologists, primary and specialty care physicians, and intervention, implementation, and healthcare delivery experts. We are poised to efficiently evaluate the full cervical cancer screening process and provide expertise, leadership, and resources for cross-organ PROSPR II collaborations. Our cores and research projects will achieve our goals of advancing understanding of screening as practiced in community settings through: (1) analysis of multilevel observational data from our heterogeneous settings with diverse populations, (2) development and testing of impactful interventions to optimize the screening process, and (3) application of our novel observational projects and quality metrics to the cancer screening processes for other organs. Based on our successful experience leading and collaborating in PROSPR I, we thoughtfully organized our four cores to be able to launch research activities and contribute to trans-PROSPR II activities quickly and effectively.",2018-04-10T12:04:00Z,2024-03-31T12:03:00Z,RFA-CA-16-016,nofo_RFA-CA-16-016,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,DALLAS,TX,UNITED STATES,prospr
UM1CA222035,Optimizing Colorectal Cancer Screening PREcision and Outcomes in CommunIty-baSEd Populations (PRECISE),"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Most deaths are preventable through early detection, but failures of screening completion and quality substantially impair test effectiveness. This proposal unites the productive PROSPR I CRC Centers into a single collaboration to address key questions and pilot interventions to improve CRC screening outcomes. In PROSPR I, we developed a strong transdisciplinary, multisite collaboration. We collected 316 data elements, performed validation studies, created high-quality pooled data sets to identify patient, provider, and system gaps in the CRC screening process factors and published >60 manuscripts. Our unified PROSPR II Research Center (PRC) will use these proven collaborations and >10 years of longitudinal data for >8.9 million screen-eligible people (~ 1 of 40 eligible people in the US), large numbers of screening exposures (>8.4 million fecal immunochemical tests [FIT] and >1.9 million colonoscopies), and outcomes (>28,000 CRCs). Our PRC is geographically, demographically and economically diverse (three states, >800,000 African Americans, 1.6 million Hispanics, and 1 million Asian Americans). The health systems have different CRC screening patterns, different modalities, and include all major insurance/reimbursement methods (safety net, Medicare, Medicaid, high-deductible and pre-paid/fee-for-service, staff-model and incentivized providers). Our PROSPR I research identified major deficiencies in three areas of CRC screening: who should get screening and surveillance and when; why people do not complete recommended screening, surveillance or follow-up of positive tests; and how test quality and accuracy can be improved. Project 1 will identify on whom and when screening should be performed, particularly for those with conflicting recommendations (e.g., African Americans aged 40-49 years, and patients 76-85 years old). Project 2 will evaluate when surveillance should occur after a precancerous polyp diagnosis, using baseline colonoscopy results and precise new 10-year risk estimates for CRC. Project 3 will explore long-term screening patterns and multilevel drivers of why screening and surveillance are not appropriately completed, especially in understudied patients who never screen, fail to re-screen, use surveillance inappropriately or fail to follow up after a positive screening test. Project 4 will evaluate how to increase the effectiveness of FIT and colonoscopy by optimizing age- and sex-stratified quantitative FIT abnormal ranges, establishing precise adenoma detection thresholds for quality improvement and evaluating drivers of adenoma detection. We will use results from these observational studies, behavioral science methods, and stakeholder involvement to develop and pilot test multilevel interventions. Our transdisciplinary team of scientists, physicians, and healthcare experts will also provide leadership and data for trans-PROSPR, multiple-organ collaborations. The proposed research can substantially decrease the burden of CRC by reducing disparities and identifying ways to improve screening completion and effectiveness.",2018-04-15T12:04:00Z,2024-03-31T12:03:00Z,RFA-CA-16-016,nofo_RFA-CA-16-016,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,Oakland,CA,UNITED STATES,prospr
UM1CA228823,Children's Oncology Group Pediatric Early Phase Clinical Trial Network,"The mission of the Pediatric Early Phase Clinical Trials Network (PEP-CTN) is to identify and develop effective new agents for children and adolescents with cancer, through rational and efficient clinical and laboratory research. PEP-CTN clinical trials will incorporate correlative genomics, biology, pharmacology, and imaging studies to further the understanding of the disposition and action of new agents introduced into the treatment of children with cancer. Annually, the PEP-CTN will enroll approximately 120 children and adolescents with cancer onto clinical trials of novel anticancer agents at the 21 core premier pediatric oncology sites throughout the country. The network institutions are selected through a peer review process, and serve as a national and international model for new agent development in pediatric oncology. The PEP- CTN will leverage the database infrastructure and resources of the parent Children's Oncology Group while maintaining its own administrative and operational infrastructure to ensure rapid development, implementation, and reporting of specialized and complex early phase clinical trials. The PEP-CTN has expertise and resources for the conduct of translational biology, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacogenetic studies, and utilizes state-of-the-art informatics systems to facilitate the transfer of response and correlative imaging studies for central review and analyses. The PEP-CTN's primary specific aims are: 1) To safely and efficiently introduce novel anticancer agents into the pediatric setting through the conduct of early phase clinical trials; 2) To expeditiously obtain preliminary efficacy signals through use of phase 2 expansion cohorts and pilot studies in order to inform tumor specific trials that will be conducted across COG sites; 3) To perform genomic analyses, including single gene studies or gene panels, to identify appropriate patients for early phase studies of targeted agents; 4) To identify associations of tumor characteristics with response to new agents using genomic analyses such as whole exome sequencing and RNA sequencing; 5) To incorporate pharmacologic and biologic endpoints, including circulating tumor DNA, other translational laboratory studies, and imaging modalities, into early phase studies, in order to enhance our understanding of the new agents and their effect on tumors.. Development of targeted therapy for childhood cancer is a high priority as it offers the prospect of more efficacious and less toxic therapeutics.",2018-09-20T12:09:00Z,2024-07-31T12:07:00Z,RFA-CA-17-027,nofo_RFA-CA-17-027,PUBLIC HEALTH INSTITUTE,OAKLAND,CA,UNITED STATES,pep_ctn
UM1CA233033,"Enhanced, EHR-facilitated Cancer Symptom Control (E2C2) Pragmatic Clinical Trial","Cancer and its treatment engender disabling symptoms that are frequently undertreated, and associated with needlessly increased healthcare utilization, non-adherence to oncologic treatments, and reduced survival. The key to addressing this damaging situation lies in reliably detecting symptoms and providing evidence-based care. Of note, the National Academy of Medicine has identified systematic screening with patient reported outcomes (PROs) as critical, not only to symptom control, but also to enhancing the patient centricity and effectiveness of cancer care in general. Unfortunately, experience has shown that simply presenting PRO data to over-loaded, treatment-focused clinicians has minimal or no impact on the outcomes of patients with many diseases, including cancer. On the other hand, providing these data to mid-level providers and entrusting them to initiate, monitor and adapt individually tailored symptom management plans has proven robustly effective in the control of cancer-related and other symptoms. However, the high resource requirements of this approach have heretofore limited its dissemination and scalability. Encouragingly, such resource intense care is not always required for meaningfully benefit, as attested by the effectiveness of interventions that provide patients experiencing mild or moderate with self-management education. This application recognizes the need for both low- and high-touch approaches to cancer symptom control and proposes the Enhanced, EHR-facilitated Cancer Symptom Control (E2C2) pragmatic clinical trial to test a bundled intervention that leverages EHR interface and clinical decision support functionalities to operationalize the population-level implementation of an approach that automatically triages symptomatic patients to low-touch automated self-management (Level 1), or high-touch nurse care management (Level 2), both validated, depending on PRO scores, as well as patient and clinical factors. The E2C2 intervention will target Sleep disturbance, Pain, Anxiety, Depression, and Energy deficit/fatigue, the SPADE pentad which represents the most prevalent and potentially treatable group of overlapping cancer symptoms. To rigorously assess the effectiveness of discrete E2C2 intervention components, we will initially test a Stage 1 Symptom Control Bundle for 12 months, after which we will add a Stage 2 Implementation Bundle. The trial's stepped wedge design will randomize the order of E2C2 implementation among 21 clusters. Clusters will be defined at the level of the cancer care team, and will be randomized to one of five different tranches to receive the intervention at staggered 6 month intervals. Outcomes will include SPADE symptom scores (primary), physical function, social participation, quality of life, distress, healthcare utilization, adherence to cancer treatment, and vital status which will be collected for 9-12 months during each trial phase; pre-E2C2, Stage 1 and Stage 2. A multi-stakeholder, mixed methods approach will be used to comprehensively assess the impact of the Stage 2 Implementation Bundle, as well as both Stages' impact on rurally-based and elderly patients, groups prone to disparities in symptom control.",2018-09-21T12:09:00Z,2024-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-17-042,nofo_CA-17-042,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,ROCHESTER,MN,UNITED STATES,impact
UM1CA233035,"Implementation and Evaluation of an Expanded Bilingual Electronic Symptom Management Program across a Multi-site, Fully-integrated Comprehensive Cancer Center","Cancer, and cancer treatment, cause many symptoms that can adversely affect quality of life. Despite the development of improved symptom management interventions, and several evidence- and consensus-based guidelines, their timely delivery remains uneven in the health care system. Our research center, Northwestern University IMPACT (NU IMPACT), builds upon an integrated cancer symptom monitoring and management system (NMPRO), currently deployed by our health care delivery system. We will test the effectiveness of a system-wide symptom management intervention when implemented across the Northwestern Memorial HealthCare Corporation (NMHC) outpatient oncology clinics. Using a clinic-level randomized roll-out implementation trial design, we will further test, using an embedded patient-level randomized controlled clinical trial, the effectiveness of an enhanced care (EC) approach aimed to engage participants actively, and to increase self-efficacy, in the monitoring and managing of their symptoms. The existing NMPRO will constitute usual care (UC), and added patient engagement and activation features will comprise the EC condition. This innovative hybrid trial design allows for a within- and between-site evaluation of implementation along with a sufficiently powered group-based comparison to demonstrate effectiveness on individual patient outcomes. We propose three specific aims that target both patient- and system-level outcomes. Aim 1: Implement a fully-integrated oncology symptom assessment and management program across six clinical units that are part of the NMHC healthcare delivery system; Aim 2: Evaluate the impact of the program by conducting a hybrid Type I effectiveness-implementation trial to evaluate the enhanced care program (EC: symptom monitoring & self-management intervention), relative to usual care (UC) on patient- and system-level outcomes; Aim 3: Identify facilitators and barriers to implementation and disseminate to other health systems. We will enroll an estimated 12,671 participants. To address possible contamination effects within each clinical unit, and allow for unit-level data collection for pre- and post-implementation comparison within and across clinical units, 50% will be enrolled and followed prior to program implementation. The other half will be enrolled post-implementation and will be randomly assigned at a 1:1 ratio (stratified by sex and cancer phase; curative intent, non-curative intent & survivorship) to UC versus EC. Fatigue, pain, anxiety, and depression will be assessed using PROMIS® computerized adaptive tests (CATs). In addition, we will assess patient clinical outcomes, including healthcare utilization, and cancer treatment delivery outcomes. The NU IMPACT study design allows joint evaluation of system-level implementation and patient-level effectiveness metrics. An extensive array of longitudinal EHR data will be integrated using custom informatics tools and deployed for statistical analysis using plans that blend psychometric and biostatistical outcome evaluation models. Successful elements of this intervention approach will then be extended to widespread adoption.",2018-09-24T12:09:00Z,2024-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-17-042,nofo_CA-17-042,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,CHICAGO,IL,UNITED STATES,impact
UM1CA233080,SIMPRO Research Center: Integration and Implementation of PROs for Symptom Management in Oncology Practice,"Project Summary In 2018, more than 1.7 million Americans will receive a new cancer diagnosis and nearly 600,000 will die from their disease. Cancer treatments, including major surgical resection and palliative chemotherapy, are associated with frequent adverse symptoms. The primary burden for managing symptoms falls on patients and their caregivers, and there is ample evidence that untreated symptoms impair quality of life, lead to inefficient use of emergency care, avoidable hospitalizations, and even shorten survival. Electronic tracking of patient- reported outcomes (ePROs) between face-to-face clinic visits has been shown to both reduce symptom burden and decrease the need for acute care. Although there is abundant evidence that symptom monitoring can improve cancer care, current experience has been largely limited to single centers or as part of clinical trials. Using ePROs to facilitate symptom control is an attractive strategy but, evidence for effectiveness in different treatment contexts and across varied populations is needed. Further, ePRO tracking systems have not been fully integrated into health systems' electronic health records (EHR) and this deficit prevents them from delivering the maximal benefits of proactive symptom management. To fill gaps in the evidence base about the optimal strategy for deploying ePROs, a multidisciplinary team from 6 health systems have formed the Symptom Management IMplementation of Patient Reported Outcomes in Oncology (SIMPRO) Research Center. SIMPRO's overarching goal is to develop, implement, and evaluate a multi-component ePRO reporting and management system to improve symptom control for patients recovering from cancer surgery or patients receiving palliative chemotherapy in small, rural, and community cancer centers. The Specific Aims of the project are to: (1) Adapt existing ePRO symptom management systems and integrate them into the EHR and routine clinical workflow at six health systems; (2) Determine the effectiveness of an EHR-integrated ePRO symptom management system on health outcomes; and (3) Evaluate the facilitators and barriers to implementation of an EHR-integrated ePRO symptom management system from the patient, clinical and organizational perspectives. Following the adaptation of operational ePRO prototypes and full integration into an EHR, the SIMPRO investigators will conduct a pragmatic cluster randomized trial with stepped wedge rollout to investigate the effectiveness of a symptom monitoring system from a patient, clinician and health system perspective. Across all study phases, the implementation process itself, including ePRO adoption, appropriateness, acceptability, penetration/scalability, and adaptation, will be critically evaluated. This approach will create knowledge that can be used to guide dissemination of ePROs and other interventions to improve cancer care delivery.",2018-09-20T12:09:00Z,2024-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-17-042,nofo_CA-17-042,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,BOSTON,MA,UNITED STATES,impact
