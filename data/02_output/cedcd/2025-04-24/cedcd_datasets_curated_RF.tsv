It was conducted from May through October 1989. Mobile trailers were used that operated in all areas of the county and at all times of day except between 1 and 6 a.m. Brief medical histories and blood pressure readings were taken, and 20 ml of blood was drawn into heparinized Vacutainers. Specimens were refrigerated at once, and processed within 24 hours. Plasma, buffy coat, and red blood cells have been preserved at -70C. A total of 32,894 persons participated, of whom 25,079 gave Washington County, MD addresses. Comparisons with published figures from the 1990 Census indicated that  approximately 30 percent of adult residents had participated. As in CLUE I, women and the better educated had higher than average participation rates, as did the age group 45 to 70 years. Data obtained at baseline include age, race, sex, marital status, time since last menstrual period, smoking history, blood pressure, medication use, hormone use, height and weight currently and at age 21. Participants were given a food frequency questionnaire to complete at home and asked to return it (80%) with a toenail clipping for trace metal assays (76%). Cholesterol results were mailed to participants within a few days of blood draw, along with guidelines for physician referral.  Information has been collected from this cohort as far back as 1963 and as recently as 2007 from the following sources: private censuses conducted in 1963 and 1975, questionnaires completed at the times of blood donation, and follow-up information from questionnaires administered in 1996, 1998, 2000, 2003, and 2007.  Cancer has developed in 8100 CLUE II participants, and plasma remains for 98 percent of these cases. There is also some normal and cancer tissue available which we are still in process of putting together the details for.  CLUE I and II Over a third of the participants in CLUE I also participated in CLUE II (9132) with 8394 forming the Odyssey Cohort. DNA has been extracted for 99% of the Odyssey Cohort.

Referred to as CLUE I (from the slogan 'Give us a Clue to Cancer'), the study was designed to collect blood samples from as many volunteers  as possible to provide specimens for a serum bank, to 'find out if certain substances in blood serum appear before the onset of cancer and other important diseases'. Mobile trailers were stationed in a wide variety of locations in an effort to give all segments of the community ample opportunity to participate. Among the total of 26,145 persons participating, 23,950 were county residents. Linkage of the records from this program to those of a private census in the summer of 1975 indicated that almost one third of the adult population of the county had participated. Eighty three percent of CLUE I Washington County residents  participated in the 1975 county census providing household data, including smoking, pets, fuel, and drinking water sources. From the supplemental census data a socioeconomic index code and passive smoking code have been determined.   CLUE I participation was best in the age group 35 to 65 years, and was slightly better among females, the better-educated, and nonsmokers. A brief medical history form was completed at the time of blood collection. A medication history (including use of vitamins and hormones) and blood pressure were taken. Blood was drawn into 15 ml Vacutainers, allowed to clot, refrigerated until it was centrifuged, and two 6 ml aliquots of serum were removed for storage at -70C. The time from blood draw to freezing was usually only a few hours, and never more than 24 hours.  Among the CLUE I participants, 7849 cases of cancer have developed, with serum remaining from 96 percent of the cases.   CLUE I and II Over a third of the participants in CLUE I also participated in CLUE II in 1989 (9111) with 8394 forming the Odyssey Cohort. DNA has been extracted for 99% of the Odyssey Cohort. For those in CLUE I and II, data obtained in 1974 and 1989 included age, marital status, time since last menstrual period, smoking history, blood pressure, medication use, hormone use, height and weight and at age 21 (from CLUE II baseline), and dietary data from a food-frequency questionnaire (from CLUE II baseline).

Over 40,000 individuals from over 15,000 families have generously contributed questionnaire data, clinical data and/or biospecimens. Over 150 individual investigators at all stages of their careers, from pre-doctoral students to full professors have used the BCFR resources (using over 200,000 biospecimen samples) since its inception, generating over 600 scientific publications.    The BCFR provides an extensive and diverse range of resources, expertise, and specialized skills, and has several unique strengths: 1) the collection of a large number of individuals and families across a wide spectrum of breast cancer risk, including both affected and unaffected individuals; 2) the large collection of families with early-onset breast cancer; 3) the large collection of racial/ethnic minority families not replicated elsewhere; 4) the extensive molecular characterization performed to date; and 5) active follow-up of both probands and family members. Thus, the BCFR comprises a unique cohort of probands and family members at familial/genetic risk of breast cancer that will continue to facilitate a wide range of research studies, such as gene discovery, examination of cancer-related outcomes and risk factors in high-risk subjects, investigation of novel behavioral interventions, and cancer prevention trials among at-risk family members. Consequently, the BCFR Cohort, as one of the few cohorts available worldwide with biospecimens and extensive molecular and genetic characterization combined with epidemiologic data and long-term follow up, will be an invaluable resource for translational research in the genetic epidemiology of breast cancer."	191	https://cedcd.nci.nih.gov/cohort?id=191	"Irene Andrulis, PhD, Jeanine M.

The researchers selected health professionals in the belief that men who chose these types of careers would be motivated and committed to participating in a long-term project and would appreciate the necessity of answering the survey questions accurately. The purpose of the study is to evaluate a series of hypotheses about men's health relating nutritional and other factors to the incidence of serious illnesses, such as cancer, heart disease, and other vascular diseases. This all-male study is designed to complement the all-female Nurses' Health Study, which examines similar hypotheses.  Every two years, study participants complete detailed questionnaires to collect information about diseases as well as health-related topics such as smoking, physical activity, sleep patterns, screening, and medications taken. The questionnaires that ask detailed dietary information are administered in four-year intervals. For participants diagnosed with prostate cancer, there are questionnaires sent every two years about treatments, disease progression, and quality of life.

The investigators studied two high-risk populations: 4,060 men with extensive occupational exposure to asbestos, and 7,965 men and 6,289 women with at least 20 pack-years of cigarette smoking history. The trial began recruitment in 1985 and was halted in January 1996, 21 months ahead of schedule, with the twin conclusions of no benefit and substantial evidence of a harmful effect of the intervention on both lung cancer incidence and total mortality. Participants were followed for over nine years post-intervention, with updated lung cancer incidence and cardiovascular disease mortality findings published in 2004. On June 30, 2005, CARET stopped active follow-up of participants. Passive follow-up to extend cancer and death outcomes through 2013 was conducted via linkages with select state cancer registries and the National Death Index (NDI).

A pre-diagnosis blood sample was collected from 3,293 and post-diagnosis blood sample was collected on 261. Of these 4,219 subjects, 759 are incident CRC cases. A pre-diagnosis blood sample was collected on 626.   All CRC tumors have been characterized for mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency, and for BRAF p.V600E and KRAS codons 12 and 13 somatic mutations. Tumors showing loss of MLH1 protein expression were also tested for methylation of the MLH1 gene promoter. Germline mutation testing in MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2 and EPCAM genes was performed for participants with an MMR deficient CRC tumor.  All CRC-affected participants, all population-based control participants and selected family-member control participants with a blood sample have been genotyped on genome wide SNP array platforms. Germline MutYH testing has been completed on all CRC-affected probands, family members of MutYH+ probands, and a sample of population-based controls. Test results are offered to cohort participants found to carry a pathogenic germline mutation in an MMR gene or in MutYH via a genetic counselor or physician.  The Colon CFR includes lifestyle, medical history, and family history data collected from 37,435 men and women from 10,769 families with colorectal cancer. The first 5-year follow-up has been completed by 29,043 participants (89% response rate), the second (10-year) by 22,893 (93% response rate), the third (15-year) by 15,332 (93% response rate) and the fourth (20-year) by 6,165 (93% response rate). 9,260 participants have died since completing the baseline questionnaire. Date of death and cause of death have been recorded."	179	https://cedcd.nci.nih.gov/cohort?id=179	"Amanda I. Phipps, PhD, MPH, Loic Le Marchand, MD, PhD, Mark A. Jenkins, PhD (Contact PI), Rish K.

The overall design, rationale, objectives, and initial results of this intervention study have been published (Ann Epidemiol 1994 Jan;4(1):1-10). Briefly, this was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, primary prevention trial to determine whether daily supplementation with alpha-tocopherol, beta-carotene, or both would reduce the incidence of lung or other cancers among male smokers.  A total of 29,133 men between the ages of 50 and 69 years, who smoked at least five cigarettes per day, were recruited from southwestern Finland between 1985 and 1988, and randomly assigned to one of four groups based on a 2x2 factorial design. Men who had prior cancer or serious illness or who reported current use of vitamins E (>20 mg/day), A (>20,000 IU/day), or beta-carotene (>6 mg/day) were ineligible. Participants received either alpha-tocopherol (50 mg/day) as dl-alpha-tocopheryl acetate, beta-carotene (20 mg/day) as all-trans-beta-carotene, both supplements, or placebo capsules for 5 to 8 years (median 6.1 years) until death or trial closure (April 30, 1993).  The study was approved by the institutional review boards of the NCI and the National Public Health Institute of Finland, and written informed consent was obtained from each participant before randomization. Post-intervention follow-up has continued through the Finnish Cancer Registry with cancer data available through 2012 and mortality data through 2013.

EPIC was established primarily to investigate the role of nutrition in cancer development and the multi-country design was intended to capture variation in diet and lifestyle habits across Western European countries. Detailed information on diet, lifestyle characteristics, anthropometric measurements, and reproductive and medical history was collected at recruitment. Lifestyle exposures were re-assessed during follow-up in most participating centres, on average 7 years after baseline. Biological samples including plasma, serum, leukocytes, and erythrocytes were also collected at baseline from 387,889 individuals and are stored at the International Agency for Research on Cancer/World Health Organization (IARC-WHO) and mirrored at EPIC collaborating centres. EPIC is jointly coordinated by Imperial College London (Professors Elio Riboli and Marc Gunter) and IARC (Drs Pietro Ferrari and Paul Brennan) and is governed by a steering committee comprising representatives from each EPIC centre. Follow-up of study participants is coordinated by the individual EPIC centres through cancer registry linkage or active follow-up and data is centralized at IARC. Since recruitment, approximately 62,000 EPIC participants have been diagnosed with cancer including 16,000 breast cancers, 6,500 colorectal cancers, 5,000 lung cancers, 1,500 pancreatic cancers and 500 liver cancers. As a consortium EPIC has produced more than 3,000 scientific articles with numerous additional publications originating from the individual participating EPIC cohorts. Notable sub-studies within EPIC include EPIC-Interact and EPIC-CVD, case-cohort studies to investigate the etiology of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, respectively; EPIC-PANACEA, a study of the causes of weight gain and obesity, and NeuroEPIC4PD which has a focus on Parkinson's and neurodegenerative diseases."	161	https://cedcd.nci.nih.gov/cohort?id=161	"Elio Riboli, Marc Gunter, Paul Brennan, Pietro Ferrari"		Cancer Epidemiology Descriptive Cohort Database (CEDCD)						Etiology	Multiple Cancer Types	521323		https://epic.iarc.who.int/		"All Other Cancers, Bladder, Bone, Brain, Cervix (Squamous cell carcinoma, Adenocarcinoma), Colon, Corpus, body of uterus, Esophagus, Gall bladder and extrahepatic bile ducts, Hodgkin Lymphoma, Invasive Breast Cancer, Kidney and other unspecified urinary organs, Leukemia, Liver and intrahepatic bile ducts, Lung and bronchus, Melanoma (excluding mucosal sites), Myeloma, Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, Oropharyngeal, Ovary, fallopian tube, broad ligament, Pancreas, Prostate, Rectum and anus, Small intestine, Stomach, Thyroid"	"Buffy Coat and/or Lymphocytes, Feces, Saliva and/or Buccal, Serum and/or Plasma, Tumor Tissue FFPE, Tumor Tissue Fresh/Frozen, Urine"	1992	1999	30	75

To accomplish these goals, the study has enrolled WHI participants with one or more of these cancer diagnoses and collected additional information on cancer treatment and outcomes through a baseline and annual follow-up questionnaires about health conditions and well-being. The investigators have developed a biorepository of FFPE tumor tissue from both living LILAC participants and deceased WHI participants, and are obtaining  cancer treatment and recurrence data from both medical records and administrative data sources such as Medicare and HMOs. Examples of how these data may be used by future investigators include research into:      - The effect of pre and post-diagnostic risk factors on cancer outcomes by molecular subtype.     - The prognostic value of tissue-based biomarkers on cancer survival, and blood and tissue-based biomarkers on cancer recurrence.     - The relationship between treatment and comorbidities, treatment complications, functional status, cancer prognosis, second cancers and the development of new comorbid conditions compared to similar women without cancer.     - Health services resource utilization, health related quality of life, cost and cost-effectiveness as they relate to cancer diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes.     - The influence of pre-diagnostic social, physical, and clinical factors on incidence of molecularly defined cancer subtypes."	159	https://cedcd.nci.nih.gov/cohort?id=159	"Electra Paskett, Garnet Anderson"		Cancer Epidemiology Descriptive Cohort Database (CEDCD)						Survivor	Multiple Cancer Types	17140		http://sp.whi.org/studies/LILAC/Pages/Home.aspx		"All Other Cancers, Bladder, Bone, Brain, Cervix (Squamous cell carcinoma, Adenocarcinoma), Colon, Corpus, body of uterus, Esophagus, Gall bladder and extrahepatic bile ducts, Hodgkin Lymphoma, Invasive Breast Cancer, Kidney and other unspecified urinary organs, Leukemia, Liver and intrahepatic bile ducts, Lung and bronchus, Melanoma (excluding mucosal sites), Myeloma, Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, Oropharyngeal, Ovary, fallopian tube, broad ligament, Pancreas, Prostate, Rectum and anus, Small intestine, Stomach, Thyroid"	"Buffy Coat and/or Lymphocytes, Feces, Saliva and/or Buccal, Serum and/or Plasma, Tumor Tissue FFPE, Tumor Tissue Fresh/Frozen, Urine"	2013	2023	65	100

This multi-million dollar project, sponsored by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), NHLBI, involves 161,808 women aged 50 to 79, and is one of the most definitive, far-reaching clinical trials of postmenopausal women's health ever undertaken in the United States. The WHI Clinical Trial and Observational Study focused on many of the inequities in women's health research and will continue to provide practical information to women and their physicians about hormone therapy, dietary patterns, calcium/vitamin D supplementation, and their effects on the prevention of heart disease, cancer, and osteoporotic fractures.  The WHI has two major parts: a randomized Clinical Trial (CT) and an Observational Study (OS). The randomized controlled CT enrolled 68,132 postmenopausal women between the ages of 50 and 79 into trials testing three prevention strategies. If eligible, women could choose to enroll in one, two, or all three of the trial components. The components are:    -Hormone Therapy Trials (HT): This component examined the effects of combined hormones or estrogen alone on the prevention of coronary heart disease and osteoporotic fractures, and associated risk for breast cancer. Women participating in this component took hormone pills or a placebo (inactive pill) until the Estrogen plus Progestin and Estrogen Alone trials were stopped early in July 2002 and March 2004, respectively. All HT participants continued to be followed without intervention until close-out.   -Dietary Modification Trial (DM): The Dietary Modification component evaluated the effect of a low-fat and high fruit, vegetable, and grain diet on the prevention of breast and colorectal cancers and coronary heart disease. Study participants followed either their usual eating pattern or a low-fat dietary pattern.   -Calcium/Vitamin D Trial (CaD): This component began 1 to 2 years after a woman joined one or both of the other clinical trial components. It evaluated the effect of calcium and vitamin D supplementation on the prevention of osteoporotic fractures and colorectal cancer. Women in this component took calcium and vitamin D pills or a placebo."	158	https://cedcd.nci.nih.gov/cohort?id=158	"Garnet Anderson, Jean Wactawski-Wende, Mara Vitolins, Marcia Stefanick, Rebecca Jackson"		Cancer Epidemiology Descriptive Cohort Database (CEDCD)						Etiology	Multiple Cancer Types	161808		http://www.whi.org		"All Other Cancers, Bladder, Bone, Brain, Cervical carcinoma in situ (CIN II/III, CIS, AIS), Cervix (Squamous cell carcinoma, Adenocarcinoma), Colon, Corpus, body of uterus, Ductal carcinoma in situ of breast, Esophagus, Gall bladder and extrahepatic bile ducts, Hodgkin Lymphoma, Invasive Breast Cancer, Kidney and other unspecified urinary organs, Leukemia, Liver and intrahepatic bile ducts, Lung and bronchus, Melanoma (excluding mucosal sites), Myeloma, Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, Oropharyngeal, Ovary, fallopian tube, broad ligament, Pancreas, Prostate, Rectum and anus, Small intestine, Stomach, Thyroid"	"Buffy Coat and/or Lymphocytes, Feces, Saliva and/or Buccal, Serum and/or Plasma, Tumor Tissue FFPE, Tumor Tissue Fresh/Frozen, Urine"	1993	1998	50	79

Approximately one quarter of participants are Southern European migrants to Australia, who were deliberately over-sampled to extend the range of data on lifestyle-related exposures . At baseline, lifestyle exposure information, including dietary intake, was collected in a face-to-face interview. Physical measurements and blood pressure were also taken.  A sample of blood was drawn and stored for analysis of DNA.  The first wave of active follow-up occurred between 1995 and 1998; 88% of study participants completed questionnaires by mail or phone.  A second wave of active follow-up occurred between 2003 and 2007 in which 66% of study participants attended clinics  for face-to face interviews and physical measurements, and also gave a blood sample.

At the time of recruitment, each cohort subject was interviewed in-person by a trained nurse interviewer using a structured questionnaire that included background information, history of tobacco and alcohol use, current diet, and medical history.  At the completion of the interview, the nurse collected a 10 ml blood and a single void urine specimen from the study participant.  Blood and urine samples were kept in insulated boxes with ice (0-4oC).  The serum was separated from blood specimen within 3-4 hours after collection. Two sets of serum (2 ml and 1 ml, respectively) and two sets of urine samples (10 ml each) per subject have been stored at -72 to -80oC.  In the follow-up of 2000-2001, buccal cells were collected from 13,815 original cohort participants (92% of all surviving cohort members).

From 2000 to 2005, we collected biological specimens from 32,543 subjects (28,330 bloods, 4,400 buccal cells, 31,895 urines), representing a consent rate of approximately 60 percent of surviving cohort participants.   From 2006 to 2010, we conducted a second telephone follow-up interview to update information on subject's change on smoking, dietary, and other lifestyles, body weight, physical exercise, use of medication and medical history. During 2014-2017, we administered a third telephone follow-up interview that collected additional information on cognitive function measures including the Mini Mental State Exam, Geriatric Depression and Anxiety Scales, Social Support and Stress Scales, Quality of Life and Independent Living Scale.  We have assessed these new measures on 17,107 subjects that provided data resources for research on aging and healthy living and disease outcomes including cancer.

The Iowa Women's Health Study (IWHS) recruited a population-based cohort of 41,836 Iowa postmenopausal women, ages 55 to 69 years in 1986, to determine whether diet, body fat distribution, and other risk factors were related to cancer incidence. After excluding 3830 prevalent cancers at baseline, there 38,006 women (99.1% white)  Over the years, participants have completed up to six mailed questionnaires to collect data on exposures and lifestyle factors. Cancer incidence and mortality have been ascertained since 1986 by linkage with the State Health Registry of Iowa, which is part of the NCI-funded Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program;  and the National Death Index.  The follow-up for site-specific cancer incidence and mortality is through 27 years (until 2014). New data are not being collected.  A total of 12,750 primary cancers had occurred in the cohort by the end of 2012, and among the 38,006 women who were cancer free at baseline, 11,428had developed first primary cancers. The wealth of data on the cohort is enabling investigators to conduct analyses in many areas to test hypotheses on:     -potential risk factors for uncommon cancers;    -unexamined potential risk factors for incident common cancers;    -risk factors for incident cancers examined in a limited fashion previously;     -risk factors for incident cancers among elderly women     -consequences of a cancer diagnosis among elderly cancer survivors    -potential contributors to better survival from cancer  This research project is providing valuable information on the risk and survival of cancer in older women.

Komen Tissue Bank at the IU Simon Comprehensive Cancer Center (Komen Tissue Bank, or KTB), a part of Indiana University, is the only repository in the world containing breast tissue and blood products from women who do not currently show evidence of breast cancer. To more deeply understand the evolution of the disease, it is necessary to compare abnormal, cancerous tissue to normal, healthy tissue. These samples serve as a vital control, helping us understand how healthy cells become cancerous. The tissue bank is under the direction of Michele Cote, Ph.D., a molecular epidemiologist and professor at the IU Fairbanks School of Public Health.   It is a goal of the Komen Tissue Bank to acquire biomolecules and tissue specimens from the entire continuum of breast development from puberty to menopause. The KTB collects the following types of samples: fresh frozen tissue, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue, cryopreserved tissue; blood products including whole blood, plasma, serum, and DNA from lymphocytes. The samples are collected, processed, and stored immediately after removal from the body following stringent SOP based on biorepository best practices.   To date, more than 5,500 women have donated tissue samples, and more than 11,000 women have contributed blood samples. Each donor provides richly annotated medical and demographic data which includes: basic medical history, gynecologic and pregnancy information, breast cancer risk factors, other diseases, family history of breast and ovarian cancer, hormone use, breast cancer survivor information.  The Komen Tissue Bank has formally followed its donors each year since 2014 to capture updated medical information including who develops cancer following their donation.  To date the KTB is aware of more than women who have been diagnosed with breast cancer after donating their healthy breast tissue.

Funded by the NCI and conducted by SWOG, the study opened in August 2001. The trial randomized 35,533, men 34,897 of which are eligible and have proper consent for sharing data. In 2008, primary results were reported early (planned futility analysis) indicating neither VitE nor Se supplements were associated with prevention of PCa. An updated analysis in 2011 showed a statistically significant increased risk of PCa in the VitE compared to placebo arms (hazard ratio 1.17, 99% CI 1.00, 1.36). Follow-up continued until 2014 for approximately half the participants after supplementation stopped; this included monitoring new prostate and other cancers.   There was an 'Adherence Cohort' conducted within 19 representative sites.  All 2,770 participants at these sites were asked to submit additional blood specimens at 6-months, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 years.  A Quality of Life study was implemented at 151 sites covering 11,151 participants. The SF 36-V was administered to all participants at these sites at baseline and years 1, 3, 5 and 7.   There were four ancillary studies within SELECT; studies with independent study objectives, endpoints different than prostate cancer and  independent funding  The studies were (1) Prevention of Alzheimer's Disease with VitE and Se, (2) SELECT Eye Endpoint Study (Prevention of cataracts and age-related macular degeneration), (3) Respiratory Ancillary Study (Prevention of pulmonary function decrease) and (4) Adenomatous Colorectal Polyps (Prevention of colorectal adenomas).  A case-cohort was  designed within SELECT.  Cases included men with baseline blood samples available for analysis who were diagnosed with incident, primary prostate cancers before July 31, 2009. A subcohort representative of SELECT participants was created a priori as the comparison using the following approach: men were stratified into 9 age/race cohorts: <55(African American only), and 55-59, 60-64, 65-69, >=70 years for both African Americans and others. As each prostate cancer case was diagnosed,  men for the subcohort were selected at random from those with baseline blood samples available analysis within the same age-race stratum using a ratio of 1:3 for African Americans and 1:1.5 for others. Within the case-cohort there are 1890 cases and 3091 non-cases. Baseline plasma levels of alpha- and gamma-tocopherol and selenium are available as well as toenail selenium.  Tissue and pathology reports for approximately 92.4% of cases were reviewed centrally for pathological confirmation and grading using the Gleason system."	137	https://cedcd.nci.nih.gov/cohort?id=137	"Catherine Tangen, Ian Thompson, Michael LeBlanc"		Cancer Epidemiology Descriptive Cohort Database (CEDCD)						Etiology	Multiple Cancer Types	34897		https://www.swog.org/clinical-trials/biospecimen-resources/select-biorepository		"All Other Cancers, Bladder, Bone, Brain, Cervix (Squamous cell carcinoma, Adenocarcinoma), Colon, Corpus, body of uterus, Esophagus, Gall bladder and extrahepatic bile ducts, Hodgkin Lymphoma, Invasive Breast Cancer, Kidney and other unspecified urinary organs, Leukemia, Liver and intrahepatic bile ducts, Lung and bronchus, Melanoma (excluding mucosal sites), Myeloma, Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, Oropharyngeal, Ovary, fallopian tube, broad ligament, Pancreas, Prostate, Rectum and anus, Small intestine, Stomach, Thyroid"	"Buffy Coat and/or Lymphocytes, Feces, Saliva and/or Buccal, Serum and/or Plasma, Tumor Tissue FFPE, Tumor Tissue Fresh/Frozen, Urine"	2001	2004	50	93

PCPT was a double-blind placebo controlled phase III trial that randomized 18,880 eligible participants from sites in the U.S. and Canada. At study entry, men had a normal digital rectal exam (DRE) and a PSA <= 3.0 ng/dl. The men underwent annual DREs and measurements of PSA that were processed at a central lab. AUA symptom scores, clinically significant medical conditions (e.g., diabetes, cardiovascular outcomes, other cancers) and side effects were recorded. An extensive diet questionnaire was administered after the first year on study. Prostate biopsies were recommended during the trial for men with either an elevated PSA (> 4.0 ng/ml adjusted) or DRE suspicious for cancer. All men were recommended to have an end of study (EOS) biopsy regardless of their PSA level or DRE result. Tissue from all prostate biopsies was submitted to the Pathology Core Laboratory. Serum was collected annually and there was a white blood collection for which approximately 60% of the participants with a prostate cancer endpoint have a sample. The PCPT was stopped 15 months earlier than planned. Among the 9060 men who either had an interim diagnosis of prostate cancer or an end of study biopsy, there was a 24.8% relative risk reduction in prostate cancer was observed with finasteride. However, tumors of Gleason grade 7-10 were more common in the finasteride group. All participant contact ended in June 2004.   In 2012, an analysis on the survival of the participants was performed.  Updated survival information was obtained from the Social Security Death Index which does not include cause of death.  The paper concluded that after 18 years of follow-up there was no significant difference in survival between the placebo and finasteride group either overall or after the diagnosis of prostate cancer.    Within the PCPT there is a nested case-control study.  A total of 1,809 cases of prostate cancer with available baseline serum included in this project. Approximately 40% of our cases are interim and 60% are cases detected at the end-of-study biopsy.  The 1,809 controls were randomly selected from men who completed the EOS prostate biopsy and had no evidence of prostate cancer.  Controls included all eligible non-white men (primarily African-Americans and Hispanics), to better support exploratory analyses in these subgroups.  Remaining controls were frequency matched to cases by distributions of age at randomization, in 5-year intervals, first-degree family history of prostate cancer (established risk factors for prostate cancer), and intervention arm.  By oversampling the non-white men and matching on the factors listed above, the estimated race-specific odds ratios for prostate cancer are not interpretable.  The case-control study looked at genetic, metabolic and environmental factors associated with the risks of prostate cancer overall and high grade prostate cancer specifically; and the effects of these factors on the efficacy of finasteride as a cancer preventive agent."	136	https://cedcd.nci.nih.gov/cohort?id=136	"Catherine Tangen, Ian Thompson, Michael LeBlanc"		Cancer Epidemiology Descriptive Cohort Database (CEDCD)						Etiology	Multiple Cancer Types	18880		https://www.swog.org/clinical-trials/biospecimen-resources/pcpt-biorepository		"All Other Cancers, Bladder, Bone, Brain, Cervix (Squamous cell carcinoma, Adenocarcinoma), Colon, Corpus, body of uterus, Esophagus, Gall bladder and extrahepatic bile ducts, Hodgkin Lymphoma, Invasive Breast Cancer, Kidney and other unspecified urinary organs, Leukemia, Liver and intrahepatic bile ducts, Lung and bronchus, Melanoma (excluding mucosal sites), Myeloma, Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, Oropharyngeal, Ovary, fallopian tube, broad ligament, Pancreas, Prostate, Rectum and anus, Small intestine, Stomach, Thyroid"	"Buffy Coat and/or Lymphocytes, Feces, Saliva and/or Buccal, Serum and/or Plasma, Tumor Tissue FFPE, Tumor Tissue Fresh/Frozen, Urine"	1994	1997	55	86

Women were recruited and enrolled in the cohort soon after diagnosis in the Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) health care system, on average about two months after diagnosis.  Blood and saliva specimens were collected around the time of enrollment to enable investigation of molecular factors.  Follow-up questionnaires have been mailed at 6 months, 24 months, and 72 months after baseline. These questionnaires assess updates in lifestyle and other factors.  Telephone interviews occur at 12, 48, and 96 months after baseline and biennially thereafter to identify various outcomes of interest.  We also conduct ongoing passive follow-up,  i.e., without requiring contact of study participants,  through KPNC electronic medical records and linkage to mortality databases.  Recruitment began in January, 2006.  Eligibility criteria include women aged 21 years or older at diagnosis; a member of KPNC at diagnosis; a recent diagnosis of invasive breast cancer with no previous history of cancer other than non-melanoma skin cancer; speak English, Spanish, Cantonese, or Mandarin; and live within a 65-mile radius of a field interviewer.  We completed enrollment of 4,504 women into the cohort in May, 2013.  Data that are available include those from interviews or questionnaires with study participants (e.g., on breast cancer risk factors, food and beverage intake, physical activity, use of dietary supplements and complementary and alternative therapies, quality of life, other psychosocial factors); linkage with electronic health records (e.g., details of diagnosis, conventional treatments received, comorbid conditions); linkage with area-level databases such as the California Neighborhoods Data System (e.g., census-derived measures, social and built environment measures); and data derived from analysis of biospecimens (e.g., germline genome-wide assays).  Biospecimens that are available on most cohort members include blood (stored in various fractions including serum, plasma, buffy coat and whole blood), saliva, and extracted germline DNA, all stored at Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center.  Tumor specimens, stored at KPNC, and tumor DNA, RNA, and tissue microarrays, stored at Roswell Park, are available for most of the cohort, and diagnostic slide images have also been created for most of the cohort.

These sisters have about twice the risk of developing breast cancer due to their family history and are expected to be highly motivated to participate in a long-term study. The frequency of any relevant genes and shared risk factors will also be higher, increasing the statistical power of the study to assess gene and environment interactions. Women who develop breast cancer while in the Sister Study will continue to be followed to assess the influence of environment and genes on treatment outcomes and long-term survival.  Breast cancer-free sisters aged 35 to 74 years were recruited from all states, as well as Puerto Rico, through health professionals, breast cancer advocates, the Internet, recruitment volunteers, and a national media campaign with an emphasis on recruiting under-represented groups. Study materials were available in English or Spanish. Data on potential risk factors and health status were collected in telephone interviews and mail questionnaires (Diet, Family History, and Personal Care Products). Baseline questionnaires on environmental, occupational, lifestyle, and health factors cover the lifespan from in-utero exposures through reproductive years to the present. Blood, urine, and environmental samples were collected in a home visit and banked for use in nested studies. Stored samples include whole blood, cryopreserved lymphocytes (15% random sample), plasma, serum, urine, toenail clippings, and household dust collected with alcohol wipes.  The cohort is being followed prospectively for at least 25 years. Annual updates and more detailed follow-up questionnaires every 3 years provide information on changes in vital status, medical history, and exposures. Medical records, pathology reports, and tumor tissue are sought for those who develop breast cancer, and pathology reports are sought for those who develop other cancers, with tumor tissue also collected for ovarian cancer cases. A second home visit and sample collection for all breast cancer cases and a sample of the cohort was conducted in 2014. Genetic, epigenetic and environmental biomarker data are available for several subgroups, including a racially and ethnically diverse breast cancer case-cohort sample.   The Sister Study opened nationally in October 2004 after a pilot phase that began in August 2003. Enrollment was closed in March 2009, with 50,884 women completing all baseline activities by August 2009.

All women had a 4-view screening mammogram at the time of enrollment and completed a self-administered questionnaire. A majority of the cohort (14,141) also had blood available from their routine blood work, which was saved as a source of buffy coat, or DNA, and plasma. A total of 2,284 cohort participants had a history of cancer other than of the breast. Therefore, the investigators defined a healthy cohort as the 17,639 women who were free of a history of any cancer at baseline (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer).  Follow-up for all incident cancers is performed annually using linkages to Mayo Clinic databases and the tri-state cancer registries. For those participants who have moved out of the region, the investigators use self-report, with pathology confirmation. As of July 2016, the total number of incident cancers in the healthy cohort was 2041, of which 829 were breast cancers.  The MMHS was designed to answer questions surrounding mammographic breast density, a strong risk factor for breast cancer. Analyses to date have used a case-cohort approach, in which the investigators have identified a random sample of 2,300 women from the cohort at baseline. As a part of the case-cohort design, all incident breast cancer cases are included. Mammographic density has been estimated using the Cumulus program on the enrollment mammogram from all participants in the case-cohort.

The earliest reports of high incidence of esophageal cancer in the northern parts of Iran date back to the early 1970s. A population-based cancer registry established in 1969 confirmed the high incidence of the cancer in the eastern portion of the Caspian Sea littoral, in the area which is now known as Golestan Province. The highest incidence rates were reported from the semi-desert plain settled mainly by people of Turkmen ethnicity in Gonbad and Kalaleh counties. A series of studies was conducted in the region in the 1970s, but was not conclusive in explaining the very high rates.  Etiological hypotheses related to diet and lifestyle can be best addressed in prospective cohort studies, in which measurement error can be reduced and recall bias is minimal. From 2002 to 2003, a pilot study of 1,057 subjects was conducted by the Digestive Disease Research Center (DDRC), Tehran University of Medical Sciences, in collaboration with the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, National Cancer Institute (NCI), and International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), to evaluate the logistical aspects of establishing a prospective study in Golestan. Subsequently, the Golestan Cohort Study (GCS) was launched in January 2004. The study protocol and the informed consent used for this study were approved by the relevant ethical review committees. In June 2008, the accrual goal of 50,000 subjects was reached and enrollment was closed. Yearly follow-up and linkage to local cancer registry is ongoing; repeated exposure assessments were conducted for about 20% of the cohort in 2012 and 2017.  The primary aims of the GCS are to:   -Identify risk factors for a number of outcomes by a comprehensive assessment of ethnicity; occupational history; socioeconomic status; past medical history; family history of cancers; gastrointestinal symptoms and signs; tobacco, opium and alcohol use; oral health; anthropometric characteristics; physical activity; and tea drinking habits, including tea temperature. These outcomes include (but are not limited to):           - upper GI (esophageal and gastric) cancers           - other cancers           - overall and cause-specific mortality           -other common chronic disease, such as ischemic heart disease   -Establish biospecimen banks for blood, urine, hair, and nail samples to be used in molecular and genetic studies of cross-sectional or nested case-control design. -Provide a model for population-based studies in a country in economic and social transition based on collaboration between local health workers, local health authorities, national research centers, the national government, and international research institutions."	118	https://cedcd.nci.nih.gov/cohort?id=118	"Arash Etemadi, Christian Abnet, Farin Kamangar, Paolo Boffetta, Paul Brennan, Reza Malekzadeh"		Cancer Epidemiology Descriptive Cohort Database (CEDCD)						Etiology	Multiple Cancer Types	50045		https://dceg2.cancer.gov/gemshare/		"All Other Cancers, Bladder, Bone, Brain, Cervix (Squamous cell carcinoma, Adenocarcinoma), Colon, Corpus, body of uterus, Esophagus, Gall bladder and extrahepatic bile ducts, Hodgkin Lymphoma, Invasive Breast Cancer, Kidney and other unspecified urinary organs, Leukemia, Liver and intrahepatic bile ducts, Lung and bronchus, Melanoma (excluding mucosal sites), Myeloma, Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, Oropharyngeal, Ovary, fallopian tube, broad ligament, Pancreas, Prostate, Rectum and anus, Small intestine, Stomach, Thyroid"	"Buffy Coat and/or Lymphocytes, Feces, Saliva and/or Buccal, Serum and/or Plasma, Tumor Tissue FFPE, Tumor Tissue Fresh/Frozen, Urine"	2004	2008	40	75

The accumulation and severity of these acute and chronic health conditions broadly impact PCS functioning, quality of life, and health care resource utilization. Consequently, PCS are more likely to live in financial hardship, have lower educational attainment, be unemployed due to poor health, and be under- or uninsured compared with their age-based peers. Latino PCS are at particularly high risk for having a lower socioeconomic status (SES compared with non-Latino PCS. These factors contribute to reduced access to routine medical care, and lower overall survival of Latino children diagnosed with cancer. Existing and well-established patient cohorts of PCS largely include long-term (at least 5 years) survivors and a relatively small proportion of Latino PCS, so that the outcome data that inform our understanding of risk for cancer treatment late effects, and therefore our clinical practice guidelines, are largely derived from the experiences of NHW PCS. The over-arching objective of the SALUD cohort is to identify and comprehensively assess adverse outcomes among Latino PCS that will inform clinical guidelines and lay the foundation for early, targeted interventions to mitigate such outcomes in this vulnerable and growing population of PCS. Key to the success of our proposal is the prospective establishment of a Latino PCS cohort in Texas that is linked with genomic and geographic data, which will permit analyses of the interaction between ancestry and SES on risk for adverse cancer treatment outcomes. There is a significant unmet need to comprehensively characterize the socioeconomic, psychosocial, genomic, and metabolomic risk determinants of treatment-related toxicities and relapse in Latino PCS in the context of known clinical risk factors."	113	https://cedcd.nci.nih.gov/cohort?id=113	"Michael Scheurer, PhD"		Cancer Epidemiology Descriptive Cohort Database (CEDCD)						Etiology	Multiple Cancer Types					"All Other Cancers, Bladder, Bone, Brain, Cervical carcinoma in situ (CIN II/III, CIS, AIS), Cervix (Squamous cell carcinoma, Adenocarcinoma), Colon, Corpus, body of uterus, Ductal carcinoma in situ of breast, Esophagus, Gall bladder and extrahepatic bile ducts, Hodgkin Lymphoma, Invasive Breast Cancer, Kidney and other unspecified urinary organs, Leukemia, Liver and intrahepatic bile ducts, Lung and bronchus, Melanoma (excluding mucosal sites), Myeloma, No Cancer, Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, Oropharyngeal, Ovary, fallopian tube, broad ligament, Pancreas, Prostate, Rectum and anus, Small intestine, Stomach, Thyroid"	"Buffy Coat and/or Lymphocytes, Feces, Saliva and/or Buccal, Serum and/or Plasma, Tumor Tissue FFPE, Tumor Tissue Fresh/Frozen, Urine"

Self-reported cancer diagnoses are verified by medical record review. Linkage with state cancer registries is used when medical records cannot be obtained. The vital status of study participants is updated biennially through linkage with the NDI. In 1998, the CPS-II LifeLink Cohort was initiated to obtain blood samples from surviving members of the CPS-II Nutrition Cohort in 20 states who resided near blood collection centers at 312 collaborating community hospitals in urban or suburban areas. Blood samples were provided by 39,380 cohort members (30.5% of invited participants). Collection began in 1998 and was completed in 2001.

Over 30 years and more than 400 published research reports later, it continues as a prospective cohort study.  PHS I is a landmark clinical trial that began in the fall of 1982, with the aim of testing the benefits and risks of aspirin and beta-carotene in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease and cancer in 22,071 men initially aged 40-84 years. The trial's finding in 1988 that low-dose aspirin decreased the risk of a first myocardial infarction by 44% came ahead of the scheduled timeline for completion and helped focus on the role of aspirin in primary prevention of coronary heart disease. The beta-carotene component of the trial, which continued uninterrupted until the study's scheduled termination in 1995, showed no statistically significant benefit or harm after 12 years of supplementation with regard to malignant cancers, cardiovascular disease or mortality.   PHS II, began in 1997 with the aim of testing the balance of benefits and risks of beta-carotene in conjunction with three widely used supplements - vitamin E, vitamin C, and a multivitamin - in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease, cancer, age-related eye disease, and cognitive decline in 14,641 men initially aged 50+ years, including 7,641 PHS I participants and 7,000 newly recruited male physicians. It was decided in 2003 that, based on two decades' worth of data contributed by PHS participants, beta-carotene did not reduce the risk of total cardiovascular disease, total cancer, or total mortality, nor did it impact cognitive performance. The vitamin C and vitamin E components ended as planned in 2007, and these vitamin supplements did not prevent major cardiovascular events, cancer, or eye disease. The multivitamin component ended as planned in 2011, for which those taking a multivitamin had modest but significant reduction in cancer and cataract, and no overall effect on major cardiovascular events, age-related macular degeneration, or cognitive decline.

It is the only CRC cohort that includes the collection of clinical and risk factor data and the sampling of a diverse panel of biospecimens at multiple critical time points (prior to surgery and at 3, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 months post-surgery). This unique design with repeat assessments enables innovative research into the influence of lifestyle/behavioral factors on patient outcomes; ethnic/racial disparities in clinical outcomes; the discovery and validation of novel biomarkers from blood, urine and stool useful for guiding treatment decision-making and risk prediction; and interactions between treatment, risk factors, and biomarkers on clinical outcomes. ColoCare was initiated at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center (FHCC) with subsequent consortium sites at the Moffitt Cancer Center (Moffitt), German Cancer Research Center (Heidelberg, HBG), and Huntsman Cancer Institute (HCI) with predominantly institutional start-up funding for patient recruitment. Currently, n>3,500 patients have been recruited. ColoCare has successfully launched research on biologic determinants of CRC (e.g., tumor immunity, gut microbiome, epigenome), health behaviors (e.g., physical activity, adipose tissue distribution), clinical endpoints (e.g., surgical complications), as well as interrelations between these factors in the context of CRC prognosis. To accelerate patient accrual and the greater inclusion of under-represented minority participants, we propose to increase our current sample size to n=5,000 patients, further enhance our data/biospecimen collection at all US sites and  two sites with high volume of minority populations. In addition, to expand our ability to study energy balance, tumor heterogeneity, and long-term outcomes, we propose additional efforts dedicated to data collection and follow-up. Each ColoCare Study site will leverage existing infrastructure, including access to NCI comprehensive/designated cancer center cores, while utilizing well-established and consistently applied recruitment, data, and biospecimen collection protocols. Patients will be followed up both actively and passively by study staff (in-person and through medical record reviews), as well as via linkages to cancer registry and vital status records.

The parent study's goal was to investigate the role of dietary isothiocyanate exposure in recurrence and progression of NMIBC, with genetic profiles considered, and to build a resource for future collaborative studies.  A total of 1,472 newly diagnosed patients were enrolled during 2015-2019, with no prior history of bladder cancer, or other invasive cancer diagnosed within one year of NMIBC.  Lifestyle and nutritional factors were collected via participant telephone interview at two time points post-diagnosis: baseline (mean 3 months) and 12 months.  We completed chart review for treatment and recurrence and progression status confirmation at 24 months post-diagnosis.  Blood and saliva were collected after NMIBC diagnosis to provide genetic and biomarker data and are stored and analyzed at Roswell Park.  Mean time from diagnosis to baseline interview was 2.9 months and to blood collection was 5.4 months.  The overall participation rate was 54%, and of those, over 77% provided either blood samples or urine samples.  In addition, the Be-Well Study has two new goals in place.  The first is to develop and validate risk stratification and BCG response tools by incorporating molecular signatures into the current pathological classification system for optimal clinical care of NMIBC patients (R01CA257480).  The second is to comprehensively investigate body composition and the inflammatory and immune states in NMIBC patients at the time of diagnosis and evaluate how these conditions identify NMIBC patients at high risk for treatment failure and disease recurrence/progression over eight years of follow-up, considering inflammatory-related lifestyle factors (physical activity, smoking, and diet) (U01CA280991)."	95	https://cedcd.nci.nih.gov/cohort?id=95	"Li Tang, Marilyn Kwan (contact)"		Cancer Epidemiology Descriptive Cohort Database (CEDCD)						Etiology	Multiple Cancer Types	1472		kp.org/be-well		"All Other Cancers, Bladder, Bone, Brain, Cervical carcinoma in situ (CIN II/III, CIS, AIS), Cervix (Squamous cell carcinoma, Adenocarcinoma), Colon, Corpus, body of uterus, Ductal carcinoma in situ of breast, Esophagus, Gall bladder and extrahepatic bile ducts, Hodgkin Lymphoma, Invasive Breast Cancer, Kidney and other unspecified urinary organs, Leukemia, Liver and intrahepatic bile ducts, Lung and bronchus, Melanoma (excluding mucosal sites), Myeloma, No Cancer, Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, Oropharyngeal, Ovary, fallopian tube, broad ligament, Pancreas, Prostate, Rectum and anus, Small intestine, Stomach, Thyroid"	"Buffy Coat and/or Lymphocytes, Feces, Saliva and/or Buccal, Serum and/or Plasma, Tumor Tissue FFPE, Tumor Tissue Fresh/Frozen, Urine"	2015	2019	21	101

The underlying rationale for the trial is that screening for cancer may enable doctors to discover and treat the disease earlier. Numerous epidemiologic and ancillary studies are included to answer related crucial questions.  Together, these four cancers are estimated to account for about 40 percent of all diagnosed cancers in the United States and 45 percent of cancer deaths in 2009.  Sponsored and run by NCIs Division of Cancer Prevention (DCP), in collaboration with the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), the PLCO Trial is taking place at ten screening centers across the country.  Between 1992, when the trial opened, and by 2001, when enrollment ended, 155,000 women and men between the ages of 55 and 74 who had no previous diagnosis of cancer of the prostate, lung, colon/rectum, or ovary had joined. At entry, participants were randomly divided into one of two study groups. One group received routine health care from their health providers. The other group received a series of exams to screen for prostate, lung, colorectal, and ovarian cancers. Screening of participants ended in late 2006. Active follow-up is continuing for up to 14 years as originally scheduled, with an additional follow-up for at least five years being planned. New findings are noted as they are published on the  PLCO News Updates and Publications.  With more than 2.6 million biological samples collected, the PLCO Trial is a rich and unique resource for etiologic and early marker studies. The Etiology and Early Marker Studies (EEMS) program is a critical component of the PLCO Trial. By collecting biologic materials and risk factor information from trial participants before the diagnosis of disease, the EEMS adds substantial value by providing a resource for ancillary research projects investigating cancer etiology and early markers for detection of cancer."	90	https://cedcd.nci.nih.gov/cohort?id=90	"Paul Pinsky, Steve Moore"		Cancer Epidemiology Descriptive Cohort Database (CEDCD)						Etiology	Multiple Cancer Types	154907		https://biometry.nci.nih.gov/cdas/plco/		"All Other Cancers, Bladder, Bone, Brain, Cervix (Squamous cell carcinoma, Adenocarcinoma), Colon, Corpus, body of uterus, Ductal carcinoma in situ of breast, Esophagus, Gall bladder and extrahepatic bile ducts, Hodgkin Lymphoma, Invasive Breast Cancer, Kidney and other unspecified urinary organs, Leukemia, Liver and intrahepatic bile ducts, Lung and bronchus, Melanoma (excluding mucosal sites), Myeloma, Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, Oropharyngeal, Ovary, fallopian tube, broad ligament, Pancreas, Prostate, Rectum and anus, Small intestine, Stomach, Thyroid"	"Buffy Coat and/or Lymphocytes, Feces, Saliva and/or Buccal, Serum and/or Plasma, Tumor Tissue FFPE, Tumor Tissue Fresh/Frozen, Urine"	1993	2001	55	74

The study aims at providing information on determinants of health differences between Poland and other countries in the region, especially related to premature mortality. The baseline data collection contains records for 13147  individuals (201011), between 45 and 64 years of age, from the city of Kielce and surrounding rural area. All cohort members were volunteer participants and gave informed consent prior to inclusion. Data were collected on current health status, medical history and health-related behaviors with focus on preventable causes of chronic diseases, including tobacco smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity and dietary habits. In addition to an extensive questionnaire, blood and urine samples were collected for storage. The study is expected to provide valuable evidence related to various lifestyle behaviors and health, and insight into the usefulness of population approaches for preventive interventions in Polish communities.  The primary objectives of the PONS study are to:  (i) describe mortality and morbidity characteristics of the most prevalent chronic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus and cancer;  (ii) identify environmental risk factors (lifestyle, diet, occupational) and life-course determinants of common chronic diseases;  (iii) assess the effects of both established and emerging risk factors for different diseases, both overall and in subgroups of the population (e.g. at different ages and at different levels of other risk factors);  (iv) measure and describe impact of socioeconomic changes on health; and  (v) provide framework for intervention studies.

About 45,000 LSS participants completed questionnaires in the late 1960s and periodically since then on sociodemographic, lifestyle, and other disease risk factors.  Mortality and cancer incidence follow-up of the LSS cohort is continuing, and about one-third of participants are still alive.

The principal mortality and cancer incidence tabulations in relation to age, sex and radiation dose are freely available for downloading on the RERF website for analysis.  Follow-up mortality and cancer incidence data have also been maintained on about 77,000 F1 offspring of the A-bomb survivors.  A clinical subsample, the Adult Health Study (AHS), of about 17,000 participants was established in 1958 and has received biennial clinical examinations since that time.

Approximately one quarter of participants are Southern European migrants to Australia, who were deliberately over-sampled to extend the range of data on lifestyle exposures and to increase genetic variation. At baseline, lifestyle exposure information, including dietary intake, was collected in a face-to-face interview. Physical measurements and blood pressure were also taken. A sample of blood was drawn and stored for analysis of DNA and other molecules of interest.  Follow-up was conducted by mailed questionnaire and telephone to update lifestyle exposures and self-reports of non-cancer, non-fatal health events at 3 to 4 years after baseline. During 2003-2006, approximately 27,000 cohort participants attended the study centre to repeat the baseline measures and health survey. Follow-up is continuing.  The study's main focus has been on identifying risk factors for cancer and other chronic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, eye disease, and arthritis. Through data collected from this contemporary large cohort study, the investigators are studying the determinants of chronic disease, with the aim of developing prediction tools applicable to the current Australian population. Results from this study will allow future patterns of chronic disease to be accurately forecasted, which in turn permits preventive strategies to be used in a more effective manner."	24	https://cedcd.nci.nih.gov/cohort?id=24	Graham Giles		Cancer Epidemiology Descriptive Cohort Database (CEDCD)						Etiology	Multiple Cancer Types	41514		http://www.pedigree.org.au/pedigree-studies/health2020.aspx		"All Other Cancers, Bladder, Bone, Brain, Cervix (Squamous cell carcinoma, Adenocarcinoma), Colon, Corpus, body of uterus, Esophagus, Gall bladder and extrahepatic bile ducts, Hodgkin Lymphoma, Invasive Breast Cancer, Kidney and other unspecified urinary organs, Leukemia, Liver and intrahepatic bile ducts, Lung and bronchus, Melanoma (excluding mucosal sites), Myeloma, Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, Oropharyngeal, Ovary, fallopian tube, broad ligament, Pancreas, Prostate, Rectum and anus, Small intestine, Stomach, Thyroid"	"Buffy Coat and/or Lymphocytes, Feces, Saliva and/or Buccal, Serum and/or Plasma, Tumor Tissue FFPE, Tumor Tissue Fresh/Frozen, Urine"	1990	1994	27	76

This cohort will enable questions about diet and cancer to be addressed that are not easily answered with other study populations. About half of Adventists are vegetarian (about 8-9% vegan) and others eat meat with varying frequency.  Taking advantage of the unusual dietary habits of Adventists, the special focus of this research is to investigate associations between soy intake, long chain fatty acids, dairy, meats, calcium intake, and cancers of the breast, prostate, and colon. About half of black and white Adventists consume quantities of soy similar to the China or Singapore population. Adventists also vary widely in their intake of calcium and dairy products.   The very high incidence and mortality ascribed to prostate cancer in black men may be associated with their dietary habits. The investigators have completed a substantial amount of pilot work with black Adventists. In the past, however, they had not yet successfully established a cohort of black members. Cohort members were enrolled church-by-church using a pretested plan whereby institutional media and respected members at individual churches promoted the study. Participants completed a comprehensive questionnaire that was pretested.  Cancer surveillance during follow-up is by matching with state tumor registries where possible, matching with the National Death Index, and by obtaining and coding hospitalization records as necessary. Calibration studies in both black and white Adventists will allow bias correction. The investigators believe that it is important to also gather blood, urine, and subcutaneous fat from the study participants, and have a completed representative calibration study (n=1,011) to accomplish this.  The Adventist population has cooperated with epidemiologic investigators for many years and has some unusual strengths as a research population, including the virtual absence of confounding by tobacco and alcohol, the wide range of dietary habits, and the widespread use of soy products. They have made important contributions to the understanding of diet and chronic disease in the past. This cohort study will provide much greater statistical power, more accurate and documented exposure assessment, and includes a larger cohort of black Adventists than past studies."	16	https://cedcd.nci.nih.gov/cohort?id=16	Gary Fraser		Cancer Epidemiology Descriptive Cohort Database (CEDCD)						Etiology	Multiple Cancer Types	96000		http://www.llu.edu/public-health/health/index.page?rsource=adventisthealthstudy.com		"All Other Cancers, Bladder, Bone, Brain, Cervix (Squamous cell carcinoma, Adenocarcinoma), Colon, Corpus, body of uterus, Esophagus, Gall bladder and extrahepatic bile ducts, Hodgkin Lymphoma, Invasive Breast Cancer, Kidney and other unspecified urinary organs, Leukemia, Liver and intrahepatic bile ducts, Lung and bronchus, Melanoma (excluding mucosal sites), Myeloma, Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, Oropharyngeal, Ovary, fallopian tube, broad ligament, Pancreas, Prostate, Rectum and anus, Small intestine, Stomach, Thyroid"	"Buffy Coat and/or Lymphocytes, Feces, Saliva and/or Buccal, Serum and/or Plasma, Tumor Tissue FFPE, Tumor Tissue Fresh/Frozen, Urine"	2002	2007	30	111
