HGi v3 contains the post-transcriptional layer of the HGi, which includes the miRNA-target (RNA-RNA) layer of the interactome.	ctd2_001	Andrea Califano, Ph.D.	22000015		microRNA target predictions	Brain Cancer				microRNA target predictions were obtained using a two-step machine learning approach. First, sites predicted using miRanda, PITA and TargetScan were scored by classifying sites against a gold standard of validated interactions using a Support Vector Machine (SVM). The SVM is trained on features including the normalized score from the predicting algorithm, conservation across mammalian genomes, and site location relative to the start and end positions of the 3' UTR. Then co-expression, site scores, and modular site grammar were used to predict interactions with SVM. Features and parameters were selected using cross validation and produced high confidence predictions after retraining the SVM on the complete dataset.

To this end, a reverse-engineered T-ALL context-specific regulatory interaction network was created from a phenotypically diverse T-ALL gene expression dataset, and then this network was interrogated using master regulator analysis to find drivers of glucocorticoid resistance. The T-ALL gene expression dataset represented many different biological conditions, genotypes, signaling and transcriptional states, thus providing significant variation in which to detect gene expression correlations. The expression level of transcription factors is often a poor predictor of their activity and biological relevance. However, their activity at the protein level can be inferred by measuring changes in the gene expression of their targets between two phenotypes, for example between tumor and normal tissue. This approach, called master regulator analysis, has been used successfully to identify functional drivers of cancer in a number of studies. In this study, master regulator analysis was used to identify regulatory genes whose network targets were enriched in the signal transduction cascade (as reflected in a differential gene expression signature) associated with glucocorticoid resistance. Microarray gene expression data used in network generation and master regulator analysis is available in Gene Expression Omnibus under accession number GSE32215.	ctd2_002	Andrea Califano, Ph.D.	24291004		Microarray gene expression	Leukemia		https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE32215		For each gene in a list of regulatory genes (hubs), the ARACNe algorithm1,2 is used to measure the mutual information between that gene and all remaining genes in the dataset. First, a preprocessing run is performed in which a curve relating mutual information to significance is generated. Next, ARACNe is run using the adaptive partitioning algorithm, repeated 100 times with bootstrapping3. A key step after each run of ARACNe is the application of the Data Processing Inequality to remove indirect interactions, typically with a zero threshold. A final consensus network is reconstructed from the bootstrapped networks based on the support of each edge, using a null distribution obtained via permutations. Gene expression data from 223 T-ALLs (Human U133 Plus2.0 Affymetrix microarray platform) was subjected to GC Robust Multi-Aarray normalization and non-specific filtering (removing probes with no Entrez id, Affymetrix control probes, and non-informative probes by IQR variance filtering with a cutoff of 0.5). A set of hub genes was defined including genes with annotated functions in signaling transduction (GO:0007165) such as kinases, phosphatases, ubiquitin ligases, etc. to establish a signaling factor-centered interactome at the transcriptional level. ARACNe was used to identify targets of these hub genes (that is, genes with significant mutual information with the hub genes). It was run using the adaptive partitioning algorithm with a p-value threshold of 1e-7, DPI tolerance of 0, and 100 rounds of bootstrapping. For master regulator analysis, a group of 22 glucocorticoid resistant and 10 glucocorticoid sensitive T-ALLs was selected from the larger dataset used in network generation. Genes were ranked by their differential expression between these two conditions. The MARINa algorithm uses Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)4 to test the differential enrichment of the regulons of hub genes (network first-degree neighbors) in the rank of genes differentially expressed between glucocorticoid sensitive and glucocorticoid resistant samples5. For GSEA method the 'maxmean' statistic6 was applied to score the enrichment of the gene set in the glucocorticoid resistant vs. glucocorticoid sensitive leukemias and sample permutation was used to build the null distribution for statistical significance.

As a component of this project, we used drug perturbation assays to scan a library of compounds against the H-STS neuroendocrine tumor cell line. We evaluated each compound's ability to invert the concerted activity of master regulator proteins that mechanistically regulate tumor cell state.	ctd2_003	Andrea Califano, Ph.D.	29915428		Small Molecule Screening	Multiple Cancer Types		https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE96760		H-STS cells were perturbed with a library of 107 small-molecule compounds at their corresponding ED20 concentration and one-tenth of it. Cells were lysed at 6?h and 24?h after small-molecule compound perturbation and total RNA was isolated for RNA-Seq analysis. Libraries for RNA-seq were generated with the TruSeq protocol (Illumina) and sequenced in a Hi-Seq 2500 instrument (Illumina).

Here we describe its application to small molecule perturbation experiments using BT20 breast cancer cells. PLATE-Seq is part of a larger analysis pipeline that uses reverse-engineered gene regulatory networks, greatly reducing the sample sizes required to infer regulatory protein activity.	ctd2_004	Andrea Califano, Ph.D.	28740083		Pooled Library Amplification for Transcriptome Expression (PLATE-Seq)	Multiple Cancer Types		https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE97460		We use automated liquid-handling to introduce lysis buffer, capture polyadenylated mRNA with an oligo(dT)-grafted plate, and deliver well-specific, barcoded oligo(dT) primers to every sample in a multi-well plate. After reverse transcription, the cDNA in each well contains a specific barcode sequence on its 5'-end and a common adapter, such that all samples can be combined into a single pool for purification and concentration. We then use Klenow large fragment for pooled second-strand synthesis from adapter-linked random primers. Because this polymerase lacks strand-displacement and 5'-to-3' exonuclease activities, each cDNA molecule produces at most, one second-strand synthesis product containing the sample barcode. Finally, the pooled library is enriched in a single PCR prior to sequencing. The resulting libraries represent the 3'-ends of mRNAs and are sequenced to a depth of 0.5-2 million raw reads per sample. To characterize the performance of PLATE-Seq, we conducted a fully automated, 96-well screen to profile BT20 breast cancer cells following treatment with seven well-characterized small-molecule perturbagens (plus DMSO controls) and 12 replicates per condition.

In the course of validating the approach, we reverse-engineered a gene regulatory network using gene expression profiles from a cohort of 212 gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs), a rare malignancy originating in the pancreas and gastrointestinal tract.	ctd2_005	Andrea Califano, Ph.D.			RNA Sequencing	Multiple Cancer Types		https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE98894		Expression profiles were obtained for the samples by RNA-Seq.

The results show the critical effect of disrupting a 10-protein module centered around a YAP/TAZ-independent TEAD4-MYCN positive-feedback loop in MYCNAmp neuroblastomas, nominating TEAD4 as a novel candidate for therapeutic intervention.	ctd2_006	Andrea Califano, Ph.D.	29510988		Master Regulator (MR) Protein Screening	Neuroblastoma				The subtype-specific candidate master regulator (MR) proteins were inferred by independent analysis of the National Cancer Institute's Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments (TARGET) and the European Neuroblastoma Research Consortium (NRC) datasets. Algorithm for the Reconstruction of Accurate Cellular Networks based on an Adaptive Partitioning strategy (ARACNe-AP) was used to assemble cohort specific interactomes from the gene-expression profiles of neuroblastoma samples from TARGET and NRC datasets. Candidate MR proteins for each of the high-risk subtypes were then prioritized based on the enrichment of their transcriptional target genes in the subtype-specific signature using the Virtual Inference of Protein activity by Enriched Regulon (VIPER) algorithm.

In this study, pARACNe was applied to analyze published mass spectrometry-based phosphotyrosine profile data from 250 lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) samples. The resulting network includes 43 Tyrosine Kinases (TKs) and 415 inferred, LUAD-specific substrates. The predictions were validated at >60% accuracy by Stable Isotope Labeling with Amino acids in Cell culture (SILAC) assays, including 'novel' substrates of the EGFR and c-MET TKs, which play a critical oncogenic role in lung cancer.	ctd2_007	Andrea Califano, Ph.D.	30615629		Statistical Analysis	Lung Cancer				The Califano lab developed a new algorithm, pARACNe, for inferring signaling networks from phosphoproteomics data. This method reports the abundance of phospho-proteins as measured by high-throughput mass spectroscopy (MS) based assay, to reveal how kinases interact with their substrates. Inferring transcriptional regulatory networks with ARACNe relies on the gene-expression data that are usually continuous and non-sparse. Data obtained from methods, such as liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) via spectral counting, are typically discrete and very sparse. To handle these discrete abundances, the mutual information computation approach was modified from a kernel density estimation-based method to a histogram-based Naive-Bayes approach.

The drug perturbational profiles on 11 cell lines and their dose-response curves for 32 chosen compounds with well-established targets will be provided to challenge participants, without revealing the identity of the drugs. These profiles will be removed from any public dataset and added back only after the challenge is completed. Transcriptional profiles for all the cell lines in which the compounds have been profiled have been provided to challenge participants, including the specific concentration at which the compound was titrated.	ctd2_008	Andrea Califano, Ph.D.	35106508		Statistical Analysis	Multiple Cancer Types				This dataset was developed in collaboration between Columbia University Irving Medical Centers (CUIMC)'s High Throughput Screening Center (HTS), Sulzberger Genome Center and the Califano Laboratory in the Department of Systems Biology. Briefly, HTS handled cell-culture, cell-perturbation experiments and RNA extraction; the Genome Center performed RNA sequencing and the Califano laboratory performed data normalization, quality control, benchmarking and scientific and statistical analysis. To determine the 48h ED20 of each drug, cell lines were plated into 96-well tissue culture plates, in 100 ?L total volume, and incubated at 37C. After 16 hours the plates were removed from the incubator and compounds were transferred into assay wells (1 ?L) in triplicate. Plates were then returned to the incubator. After 48 hours the assay plates were removed from the incubator and allowed to cool to room temperature prior to the addition of 100 ?L of CellTiter-Glo (Promega Inc.) per well. The plates were then mechanically shaken for 5 minutes prior to readout on the EnVision Multi-Label Reader (Perkin Elmer Inc.) using the enhanced luminescence module. Relative cell viability was computed using matched DMSO control wells as reference. ED20 was estimated by fitting a four-parameter sigmoid model to the titration results. Using the previously described plating and perturbation procedure we perturbed each cell-line with each drug at its 48h ED20 value (measured above) or its CMax concentration. In order to optimize the clinical translation potential of the perturbation databases, we used the CMax, defined as the maximum plasma concentration after the administration of the drug at the maximum tolerated dose in patients, (whenever available from published pharmacokinetic studies), as an upper bound for the perturbation studies (Table S1). The mRNA from these cells was isolated and profiled by PLATESeq (Nat. Commun. 2017, 8, 105) at 24h after each perturbation. RNASeq reads were mapped for each well to the human reference genome assembly 38 using the STAR aligner,57 version 2.5.2b. Individual plates counts files were then combined, normalized and corrected for batch effects. First, individual counts files were combined across genes and ERCC2 spike-in counts removed, yielding the raw counts file for each cell-line experiment. Second, raw counts were quantile normalized and variance stabilized based on the negative binomial distribution with the DESeq R system package.59 To account for plate-based batch effects (which are common with drug-perturbed transcriptomic data) normalized expression was batch corrected using ComBat.60	Columbia University	Eugene Douglass	eugene.douglass@uga.edu

To circumvent these challenges, we introduce OncoLoop, a precision medicine framework to predict drug sensitivity in both a human tumor and its highest-fidelity (cognate) model(s)-for contextual in vivo validation- by leveraging perturbational profiles of clinically-relevant oncology drugs. As proof-of-concept, we applied OncoLoop to prostate cancer using a series of genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) that capture the broad spectrum of disease states, including metastatic, castration-resistant, and neuroendocrine prostate cancer. Interrogation of published cohorts revealed that most patients were represented by at least one cognate GEMM-derived tumor (GEMM-DT), based on Master Regulator (MR) conservation analysis. Drugs recurrently predicted to invert MR protein activity in patients and their cognate GEMM-DTs were successfully validated, including in two cognate allografts and one patient derived xenograft (PDX). OncoLoop is highly generalizable and can be extended to other cancers and other pathologies.	ctd2_009	Andrea Califano, Ph.D.	36374194		Precision Cancer Medicine	Multiple Cancer Types		https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE199800			Columbia University	Alessandro Vasciaveo	av2729@cumc.columbia.edu

The drug perturbational profiles on 11 cell lines and for 30 chosen compounds will be provided to challenge participants, without revealing the identity of the drugs. In addition, basal RNAseq and Achilles RNAi dependency data will be provided for 515 cell-lines which also occur within the CTRP drug-sensitivity data set. Participants will be asked to use this data on drug-gene perturbations (PANACEA) and gene expression (RNAseq) and dependency (Achilles) to predict drug sensitivity for 30 drugs across 515 cell-lines. Predictions will be evaluated by looking at the enrichment of 'sensitive cell-lines' within the ranked predictions. 'Sensitive cell-lines' are defined by fitting raw CTRP AUC data to a bimodal normal mixture model and establishing a threshold for sensitivity at a p-value of 0.5 with respect to the most resistant sub-population.

Analysis of TI vs. peripheral Tregs (P-Tregs) from 36 patients, across four malignancies, identified 17 candidate master regulators (MRs) as mechanistic determinants of TI-Treg transcriptional state. Pooled CRISPR-Cas9 screening in vivo, using a chimeric hematopoietic stem cell transplant model, confirmed the essentiality of eight MRs in TI-Treg recruitment and/or retention without affecting other T cell subtypes, and targeting one of the most significant MRs (Trps1) by CRISPR KO significantly reduced ectopic tumor growth. Analysis of drugs capable of inverting TI-Treg MR activity identified low-dose gemcitabine as the top prediction. Indeed, gemcitabine treatment inhibited tumor growth in immunocompetent but not immunocompromised allografts, increased anti-PD-1 efficacy, and depleted MR-expressing TI-Tregs in vivo. This study provides key insight into Treg signaling, specifically in the context of cancer, and a generalizable strategy to systematically elucidate and target MR proteins in immunosuppressive subpopulations.	ctd2_012	Andrea Califano, Ph.D.	37116491		Master Regulator (MR) Protein Screening	Multiple Cancer Types	36.0				Columbia University	Luca Zanella	lz2841@cumc.columbia.edu

We performed a first-of-kind evaluation of two transcriptome-based precision cancer medicine methodologies to predict tumor sensitivity to a comprehensive repertoire of clinically relevant oncology drugs, whose mechanism of action we experimentally assessed in cognate cell lines. We enrolled patients with histologically distinct, poor-prognosis malignancies who had progressed on multiple therapies, and developed low-passage, patient-derived xenograft models that were used to validate 35 patient-specific drug predictions. Both OncoTarget, which identifies high-affinity inhibitors of individual master regulator (MR) proteins, and OncoTreat, which identifies drugs that invert the transcriptional activity of hyperconnected MR modules, produced highly significant 30-day disease control rates. Predicted drugs significantly outperformed antineoplastic drugs selected as unpredicted controls, suggesting these methods may substantively complement existing precision cancer medicine approaches, as also illustrated by a case study.	ctd2_013	Andrea Califano, Ph.D.	37061969		Precision Cancer Medicine	Multiple Cancer Types		https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE212854		We have generated comprehensive molecular interaction networks (interactomes) using the Algorithm for the Reconstruction of Accurate Cellular Networks (ARACNe) [1, 2], although other suitable algorithms may be used. The networks were reverse engineered by ARACNe from ? 100 RNASeq profiles of human cancer tissue from (a) The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and (b) for meningioma and neuroendocrine tumors, from Columbia University collected datasets. TCGA RNASeq level 3 data were downloaded from NCI Genomics Data Commons [3]. Raw counts were normalized and variance stabilized as implemented in the DESeq2 R-package [4]. The Virtual Proteomics by Enriched Regulon analysis (VIPER) algorithm is a tool for the accurate inference of regulatory protein activity in tissue context-dependent manner [5-7]. VIPER leverages accurate tissue-specific gene regulatory networks, to measure differential protein activity from bulk or single-cell gene expression signatures (GES). For each cancer sample, we generate a differential gene expression signature (DGES)-the gene-wise relative expression to the distribution of the expression of that gene across 11,289 TCGA samples-and expressed as its quantile relative to the reference model. Next, VIPER computes enrichment scores for the targets of each regulatory protein in the DGES [5]. When cancer type specific networks are not available, we use an integrated network approach as implemented in metaVIPER [8, 9]. Through the use of (a) DrugBank [10], (b) the SelleckChem database [11], (c) published literature, and (d) publicly available information on pharmaceutical company drug development pipelines, we have curated a refined list of 180 actionable proteins representing validated targets of high-affinity pharmacological inhibitors, either FDA approved or in clinical trials. This manually curated target-drug(s) database is dominated by signaling proteins and established oncoproteins, as expected. Pharmacological agents with narrow therapeutic indices-such as those targeting neurotransmitters, ion channels, and vasoactive drugs-were purposefully removed from the database as less likely to be successfully repurposed in oncology. OncoTarget simply analyzes the VIPER outputted protein activity measurements for these 180 actionable proteins, and provides a multiple-testing corrected significance value for the corresponding NES. For the current study, we broadly adapted OncoTreat to identify tumor checkpoint module (TCM)-inverter compounds. We identify sample-specific candidate MRs and the TCMs they comprise, by VIPER analysis of the sample's DGES, compared to the set of TCGA samples (reference model). We assess drug effect by completing high throughput drug screens in relevant cognate cell lines with post-perturbation RNASeq using the multiplexed PLATESeq platform. Pharmacological agents were prioritized based on the statistical significance of the enrichment of the tumor sample's TCM-activity signature (i.e., 25?+25? MRs) in proteins inactivated and activated in drug vs. DMSO-treated cells. Model fidelity was assessed based on the statistical significance of the TCM-activity conservation between a human-derived sample and a model-derived sample. The analysis was used to (a) select optimal cell lines for the generation of perturbational profiles that effectively track the activity of tested drugs on TCM proteins and (b) to assess the fidelity of PDXs prior to validation of drugs predicted from the human sample. Fresh tumor tissue was fragmented and implanted subcutaneously into nonobese/severe combined immunodeficiency IL2Rg null, hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT)-null (NSGH) mice (Jackson Labs, IMSR catalog no. JAX:012480, RRID: IMSR_JAX:012480) and tumor engraftment monitored by visual and manual inspection. Engrafted tumors were measured twice weekly with calipers and drug treatment initiated when tumor volume (TV) reached ~100 mm3 (TV = width2 X  length). Early passage animals (Passage 1 - 5) were used for all therapeutic studies. Samples for PD assessment were procured from two mice per treatment arm. We performed RNASeq and subsequent VIPER on paired drug vs. Vehicle control-treated PDX tumor samples. TCM-inversion was assessed based on the statistical significance of the enrichment of the TCM-activity signature (i.e., 25?+25? MRs of the patient tumor) in proteins inactivated and activated in drug vs. Vehicle control-treated PDX tumors, respectively.	Columbia University	Luca Zanella	lz2841@cumc.columbia.edu
dataset	4f2e21ed-c146-57e1-8b43-44100d24da30	CTD² Network	Kinases Controlling Stability of the Oncogenic MYCN Protein	MYCN is an oncogene that codes for a driver protein often found to be aberrantly activated or amplified in the cells of tumors with poor prognoses. We previously identified the natural products isopomiferin and pomiferin as powerful, indirect MYCN-ablating agents. In this work, we expand on their mechanism of action and find that casein kinase 2 (CK2), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1) and serine/threonine protein kinase 38-like (STK38L), as well as STK38, work synchronously to create a field effect that maintains MYCN stability. By systematically inhibiting these kinases, we degraded MYCN and induced cell death. Additionally, we synthesized and tested several simpler and more cost-effective pomiferin analogues, which successfully emulated the compound's MYCN ablating activity. Our work identified and characterized key kinases that can be targeted to interfere with the stability of the MYCN protein in NBL cells, demonstrating the efficacy of an indirect approach to targeting 'undruggable' cancer drivers.	ctd2_014	Andrea Califano, Ph.D.	38116412		Competitive Binding Assay	Multiple Cancer Types				The KINOMEscan conducted by Eurofins DiscoverX is a competitive binding assay.

The beads were resuspended in elution buffer (1X PBS, 0.05% Tween 20 and 0.5 ?M non biotinylated affinity ligand) and incubated at RT while shaking for 30 minutes. The amount of kinase bound to the ligand in the eluates were measured via qPCR and compared to the DMSO control to determine %Ctrl.	Columbia University	Luca Zanella	lz2841@cumc.columbia.edu

Disruption of protein expression can suppress targets and enable therapeutic intervention. To this end, we developed a drug discovery workflow that incorporates cell-line-selective screening and high-throughput expression profiling followed by regulatory network analysis to identify compounds that suppress regulatory drivers of disease. Applying this approach to neuroblastoma (NBL), we screened bioactive molecules in cell lines representing its MYC-dependent (MYCNA) and mesenchymal (MES) subtypes to identify selective compounds, followed by PLATESeq profiling of treated cells. This revealed compounds that disrupt a sub-network of MYCNA-specific regulatory proteins, resulting in MYCN degradation in vivo. The top hit was isopomiferin, a prenylated isoflavonoid that inhibited casein kinase 2 (CK2) in cells. Isopomiferin and its structural analogs inhibited MYC and MYCN in NBL and lung cancer cells, highlighting the general MYC-inhibiting potential of this unique scaffold.	ctd2_015	Andrea Califano, Ph.D.	38061356		Pooled Library Amplification for Transcriptome Expression (PLATE-Seq)	Multiple Cancer Types		https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE245006		First Experiment (PLATESeq): To identify NBL MYCNA subtype-selective inhibitors, we systematically screened >5,000 compounds from three chemical libraries chosen for their enrichment of bioactive molecules, diversity in chemical structure, and for inclusion of compounds with known mechanisms of action. Compounds were initially tested at a single concentration and time-point (20 M for 72 h) to eliminate those with no in vitro activity in NBL cell lines. Lethal compounds were rescreened across a five-point dilution series ranging from 20 M to ~250 nM, to determine IC50 values in each of the four cell lines. By ranking compounds based on average IC50 values for each of the two subtypes, MYCNA or MES-selective compounds were identified. The top 90 compounds with the highest relative MYCNA-specific selectivity were then used to generate PLATESeq expression profiles following 24 hours of treatment in SK-N-Be2 cell lines at their respective IC20 concentration. Second Experiment (PLATESeq): top 15 compounds were screened with PLATESeq at 6 and 24 hours at multiple concentrations in three replicates Third Experiment (PLATESeq): In an effort to identify a potent analog of isopomiferin, we assembled a small collection of structurally-related analogs and known CK2 inhibitors, and tested them in SK-N-Be2 cells using PLATESeq TruSeq Experiment (RNASeq): To uncover kinase targets of isopomiferin and its functional analogs, we developed a novel algorithm, the Virtual-Inference of Kinase INhibiton by Gene regulatory networks (VIKING), to enable data-driven inference of drug targets based on activity dysregulation of protein-protein interactions (PPIs). VIKING was run using RNASeq (TruSeq) data on isopomiferin, pomiferin and its null analog, at multiple concentrations and timepoints.	Columbia University	Luca Zanella	lz2841@cumc.columbia.edu

Panc1 and Aspc1 pancreatic cancer cells were cultured in white 96-well tissue culture-treated plates at optimized density, in 100 ?l of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine. After 24 h of incubation, the plates were treated with following drugs: RAF inhibitors - Sorafenib, Dabrafenib, RAF709, PLX8394, GDC-0879; MEK inhibitors - Trametinib, Cobimetinib, Binimetinib, Selumetinib, Rafametinib; and ERK inhibitors - SCH772984, Ulixertinib, AZD0364, Ravoxertinib. Each drug was dosed at the concentration at which the cells were 80% viable after 48 h of treatment. After 24 h of treatment, the medium was replaced with 100 ml of FBS supplemented with 10% DMSO and the plates were frozen at ?80 C prior to PLATE-Seq. Detailed protocol for preparation of the automated PLATE-SEQ experiment was described by Bush et al. (Bush, Erin C., et al. 'PLATE-Seq for genome-wide regulatory network analysis of high-throughput screens.' Nature communications 8.1 (2017): 105, https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-00136-z).

The gene expression was quantified as both raw counts (i.e. sequencing fragments per genomic locus) and transcripts per million (i.e. sequencing fragments per genomic locus normalized for transcript/gene length and sample sequencing depth). Single sample differential gene expression signatures were computed independently for each one of the two cell lines and then integrated in order to derive a consensus MAPK signature. The z-score method was used to generate differential gene expression signatures of each drug-treated sample with respect to the DMSO-treated samples. Raw data (FASTQs) and processed data (raw counts) for generation of experimental MAPK pathway gene expression signature have been deposited to GEO, accession number GSE252002.

Hahn, M.D., Ph.D.	28753430		Genetic Screening	Multiple Cancer Types				DFCI extended their previous study of 216 cell lines1 by performing genome-wide pooled loss - of - function screening on additional 285 cancer cell lines across approximately 100k shRNAs (final files include 107,523 shRNA values in Achilles_v2.19.2 to produce 17,098 DEMETER gene solutions in Achilles_v2.20.2). Each cell line was infected with the shRNA pool by lentivirus, in quadruplicate and propagated for at least 16 population doublings or 40 days, whichever came first. To determine the viral volume needed to achieve the desired transduction rate of ~40%, each cell line was titrated with 6 volumes of virus (0-500 ul) in a 12 well plate at a concentration of 3E6 cells/well. Then cells were cultured in the presence or absence of puromycin in 6 well dishes before infection rates were determined. Cells were expanded for infection in quadruplicate with a target of 3.7E7 infected cells. Before infection, cells were filtered through a 40 um cell strainer to remove clumps, then resuspended in media containing 4 ug/ml polybrene, and the appropriate volume of 98K library lentivirus to achieve a cell concentration of 1.5E6 cells/ml. This cell suspension was seeded into 12 well plates at 2 ml/well and centrifuged for 2 hours at 930xg at 30 C. After the spin infection, 2 ml of fresh media was added to each well. After 24 hours, the cells from each replicate infection were pooled into T225 flasks with 60ml medium containing puromycin. To provide an in-line assessment of transduction rate, 150k of infected and uninfected cells were cultured in 6 well dishes in the presence or absence of puromycin. After 96 hours, both the in-line assay wells and the screen replicates were trypsinized. The infection rate was determined by calculating the number of viable cells selected in puromycin divided by the number of viable cells without puromycin selection. Screening was continued if the infection rates were within the range of 30-65% so that the selected cells were nearly all MOI = 1 and so that there was a sufficient number of cells to provide adequate representation of each shRNA. For each of the replicates, 6E7 cells were plated into new T225 flasks in 60ml of media with puromycin. For the remaining passages, only 3E7 cells per replicate were carried over, and the remaining cells were spun down and resuspended in PBS for genomic DNA isolation. Passaging for each cell line was continued for at least 16 population doublings or 28 days, whichever was longer. Puromycin selection was maintained until day 7. At the end of passaging, genomic DNA from the screen endpoints were used to measure the abundance of shRNAs in comparison to the initial DNA plasmid pool. Samples were sequenced using a custom sequencing primer using standard Illumina conditions. Deconvolution was performed similar to that described in Ashton et al.2 and all steps are described more completely in Cowley et al.1 with the following alterations. A total of 280??g gDNA was used as template for PCR from each replicate. Thermal cycler PCR conditions consisted of heating samples to 95?C for 5?min; 28 cycles of 94?C for 30?s, 53?C for 30?s, and 72?C for 20?s; and 72?C for 10?min. PCR reactions were then pooled per sample. After PCR and additional of sample barcodes, 20 replicates were multiplexed into a single Illumina sample, and run on multiple lanes to achieve a minimum of 27 reads per replicate.

Each Cas9-expressing cell line was subjected to a Cas9 activity assay1 to characterize the efficacy of CRISPR/Cas9 in these cell lines. Cell lines with less than 45% measured Cas9 activity were considered ineligible for screening. Stable polyclonal Cas9+ cell lines were then infected at low multiplicity of infection (MOI < 1) with a library of 76,106 unique sgRNAs (Avana), which upon remapping was composed of 72,753 targeting 18,566 genes (~4 sgRNAs per gene) annotated in the Consensus CoDing Sequence (CCDS) database, 3,353 targeting either non-coding sequences or sequences previously annotated as coding, and 995 non-targeting control sgRNAs. Cells were split into at least two replicates and selected in puromycin and blasticidin for 7 days and then passaged without selection while maintaining a representation of 500 cells per sgRNA until 21 days after infection. Genomic DNA was purified from endpoint cell pellets, the sgRNA barcodes were PCR amplified with sufficient gDNA to maintain representation, and the PCR products were sequenced using standard Illumina machines and protocols. Cell lines that failed the Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) fingerprinting described above were removed. Raw sgRNA barcode counts were deconvoluted from sequence data using PoolQ software (https://portals.broadinstitute.org/gpp/public/software/poolq) and summed across sequencing lanes. Samples were removed if they failed to reach 15 million reads. Normalized read counts for each sample were calculated according to the procedure described in Cowley et al.2 Pairwise Pearson correlation coefficients between replicate samples from the same cell line were calculated to identify and remove poor quality replicates using a threshold of 0.7. All sample read counts were then divided by their representation in the starting plasmid DNA library (pDNA) to compute a Fold-Change (FC). Strictly Standardized Mean Difference (SSMD)3 statistics were computed for the replicates using FCs between non-targeting control sgRNAs and FCs from sgRNAs targeting the spliceosomal, ribosomal, or proteasomal genes in KEGG genesets (https://www.kegg.jp/kegg). Replicates with SSMDs that fail to reach -0.5 were removed. logFC data were then normalized within each cell line replicate by subtracting the median logFC value and dividing by the Median Average Deviation (MAD) before input to CERES. After QC, 18 cell lines had one replicate, 206 cell lines had two replicates, 93 cell lines had three replicates, and 24 cell lines had four replicates. Copy Number (CN) data for all cancer cell lines were obtained from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE)4 data portal (https://portals.broadinstitute.org/ccle). The dataset CCLE_copynumber_2013-12-03.seg.txt was used for analysis. This set was derived from Affymetrix SNP6.0 arrays. Segmentation of normalized log2 ratios was performed using the Circular Binary Segmentation (CBS) algorithm. All copy-number data presented represent a relative copy number for each cell line where a value of two represents the average ploidy of the cell line. Subsequently, logFC scores for each sgRNA in each cell line and segmented copy number for each cell line were supplied to CERES, together with a mapping of sgRNAs to the hg19 reference genome to infer gene knockout effect and sgRNA on-target efficacy. Additional details regarding the experimental protocols and CERES algorithm can be found in Meyers et al 5.  Additional details regarding data processing can be found in Dempster et al 6.

The neuroblastoma cell lines were: SK-N-BE2 (MYCN amplified) and SK-N-AS (non-amplified). The kinase Hits for the MYCN amplified cell line were selected using a combination of their differential activity when compared to the non-MYCN amplified cells and also ranked by P-values, based on the replicates.	ctd2_042	Christopher Kemp, Ph.D.			Genetic Screening	Neuroblastoma			MYCN 	Neuroblastoma cell lines, SK-N-BE2 (MYCN-amplified) and SK-N-AS (non-amplified) were obtained from the American Tissue Type Collection (ATCC) and cultured in RPMI with 10% FBS and Penicillin and Streptomycin at the concentration recommended.  25mM HEPES was added during the screens to minimize variation of pH during handling of the plates. Transfection feasibility for each cell line was established using a factorial-based optimization scheme with variable parameters in cell density, liposomal, and siRNA concentration. All transfection conditions were statistically evaluated using a simple Z-factor score to determine differentials between mock-transfected cells (transfection reagent only) versus a positive control for growth inhibition (KIF11) and a negative control (non-targeting siRNA).  Based on these preliminary experiments performed on each cell line, the optimal transfection condition selected for each cell line was: 1)SK-N-BE2, cells were seeded at 1600 cells/well in 384 well. The next day 5 ?l of Dharmafect I (18.75 ?l/ml) and siRNA (2.5 pM/well) mix was added and viability with CellTiter-Glo was read at 96 hr after plating; 2)SK-N-AS: seeded at 2000 cells/well and the next day 5 ?l of Dharmafect I (18.75 ?l/ml) and siRNA (2.5 pM/well) mix was added and viability with CellTiter-Glo was read at 96 hr after plating.

While the addition of RA has greatly increased the survival of children with neuroblastoma, there is still a high frequency of relapse.  With the goal of identifying novel drug combinations that would enhance the effect of RA on neuroblastoma, an siRNA screen in the presence or absence of sub-lethal concentrations of RA was carried out. For this project, three neuroblastoma cell lines were selected based on their sensitivity to RA: 1) SY-5Y, a non-MYCN amplified line with high sensitivity to RA; 2) SK-N-BE2, intermediate sensitivity to RA; 3) SK-N-AS, a cell line insensitive to the effect of RA.  The siRNA library was a kinase targeting library as described for the previous screen (0001_NB_kinome).  The Hits from each cell line were determined based on their significance with respect to their differential activity in the presence or absence of RA within each cell line and also ranked on P-value, based the three replicates.	ctd2_043	Christopher Kemp, Ph.D.			Genetic Screening	Neuroblastoma				SY-5Y, SK-N-BE2 and SK-N-AS were obtained from the American Tissue Type Collection (ATCC) and cultured in RPMI with 10% FBS and Penicillin and Streptomycin at the concentration recommended.  25mM HEPES was added during the screens to minimize variation of pH during handling of the plates. Retinoic Acid (RA) was used at 5?M, which is half the optimal concentration used in vitro to obtain differentiation of most NB cell lines, and which is comparable to half of the therapeutic concentration achieved in vivo.

Epithelial tumor cells were enriched by selective culturing and magnetic-activated cell sorting with EpCAM microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec, San Diego, CA). The established primary cell culture was confirmed by immunohistochemistry staining with cytokeratin antibody ab961 and vimentin antibody EPR868(2) (Abcam, Cambridge, MA), and named FHCRC_SCC_11. MISSION Human Druggable Genome siRNA library (Sigma) consists of three siRNAs per gene targeting 6,659 genes. The human druggable genome siRNA working library was constructed and arrayed in a 384-well format with pools of the three independent siRNAs targeting each gene, in a one gene per well approach. A DNA damage and repair (DDR) siRNA library (318 genes) was also added to this druggable genome screen. Cisplatin dose-response curve was generated on the FHCRC_SCC_1 primary cell culture and a IC30 value was determined (ie. inhibitory concentration of cisplatin resulting in 30% reduced viability). The FHCRC_SCC_1 primary cell culture siRNA screen was performed in parallel with vehicle and cisplatin modifier at IC30 concentration to identify cisplatin sensitizers and genes that demonstrate a role in cisplatin biology. RNA interference (RNAi) druggable genome screen was performed utilizing an array-based siRNA platform on FHCRC_SCC_1. RNAi screen was performed in 384-well format in triplicate, in independent plates, utilizing robotics instrumentation. FHCRC_SCC_1 cells were plated in 384-well plates in 50 ?l per well of complete medium using a WellMate (Matrix Technologies, Canada) and transfected with siRNAs 24 hours later using Dharmafect 1 Reagent (GE Dharmacon, USA), with three siRNAs targeting the same gene pooled at equal molarities. The siRNA library was tested in triplicates to establish experimental variability and statistical validity. Cells were treated with vehicle or with cisplatin at IC30 concentration at 24 hours following transfection, and were incubated at 37C in a 5% CO2 incubator for 72 hours. Cell viability was measured as a phenotypic endpoint using the Cell-TiterGlo assay (Promega) and raw luminescence detected and quantified with an Envision Multilabel plate reader (PerkinElmer). Raw luminescence values were mock normalized per plate and plotted for distribution and data mining using a negative control siRNA (non-targeting siRNA) and a positive control siRNA targeting the kinesin motor protein (Kif11).

MSCC cell lines were derived from DMBA/TPA induced squamous cell carcinoma using a standard outgrowth explant method. A normal murine keratinocyte cell line (NIHK1) was derived from NIH/Ola strain as described in Nowak3 et al. Ambion murine kinome siRNA library contains three siRNAs per gene targeting 571 murine kinase genes. The Ambion murine kinome siRNA working library was constructed and arrayed in a 384-well format with pools of 3 independent siRNAs targeting each gene, in a one gene per well approach -Ambion Murine Kinome Library-Table S44. A custom designed murine Ras physiological regulators siRNA gene panel targeting 44 genes (4 siRNAs/gene), and a DNA repair siRNA gene panel targeting 19 genes (3 siRNAs/gene) was also added to the kinome screen. Doxorubicin dose-response curves were generated on the two MSCC cell lines and the normal keratinocyte cell line and IC30 and IC60 values were determined for each cell line. Each MSCC/NIHK1 cell line siRNA screen was performed in parallel with vehicle and doxorubicin modifier at IC30 and IC60 concentrations. Kinome-wide siRNA screens were performed on two low passage murine squamous cell carcinoma (MSCC) cell lines and a normal keratinocyte cell line (NIHK1) with cellular viability as the phenotypic endpoint. MSCC cells were plated in 384-well plates in 50 ?l per well of complete medium using a WellMate (Matrix Technologies, Canada) and transfected with siRNAs 24 hours later using Dharmafect1 Reagent (GE Dharmacon, USA), with three siRNAs targeting the same gene pooled at equal molarities. The siRNA library was tested in triplicates to establish experimental variability and statistical validity. Cells were treated with vehicle or with doxorubicin at IC30 and IC60 concentrations at 24 hours following transfection, and the plates were incubated at 37C in a 5% CO2 incubator for ~60 hours. Cell viability was assessed by CellTiter-Glo assay (Promega, WI, USA), and luminescence was quantified using an Envision multilabel plate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, MA, USA). Raw luminescence values were mock normalized per plate and plotted for distribution and data mining using a negative control siRNA (non-targeting siRNA) and a positive control siRNA targeting the kinesin motor protein (Kif11). A detailed description of methods is available in Moser4 et al., Birmingham5 et al., and Cheung6 et al. The NIHK1 keratinocyte control cell line has innate biological differences related to intensity of siRNA efficiency and universal negative control normalization yielded a more desirable relative assay range for comparing the control to the MSCC.

This project used high-throughput siRNA and drug screening of patient-derived ovarian cancer cell lines to identify gene targets and drugs that synergize with rucaparib and could be advanced in clinical trials.	ctd2_053	Christopher Kemp, Ph.D.	32927276		Genetic Screening;Small Molecule Screening	Ovarian Cancer				This project utilized two patient-derived Ovarian Cancer Ince (OCI) cell lines, OCI-P5x from serous subtype and OCI-C5x from clear-cell subtype for target discovery1. A custom siRNA working library was constructed targeting 2,187 unique genes and arrayed in a 384-well format and consisting of three independent siRNAs targeting each gene in a one-gene-per-well approach. The full custom siRNA library targets 2,400 genes in total and consists of an epigenome library (1195 genes - Ambion Silencer siRNA library - Catalog Number: 4404028), kinome library (713 genes) (Sigma), DNA damage and repair (DDR) library (318 genes) (Qiagen), and an ovarian cancer-specific library (174 genes) (Qiagen). All working libraries were arrayed at Quelllos High-throughput Screening Facility at University of Washington Institute for Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine (ISCRM). Rucaparib concentration/dose-response curves were generated on OCI-P5x and OCI-C5x cell lines and an IC30 value was determined (i.e., inhibitory concentration of rucaparib resulting in 30% reduced viability). The OCI-P5x and OCI-C5x cell lines' siRNA screens were performed in parallel with vehicle and rucaparib modifier at 20 M rucaparib (IC30) in order to identify rucaparib sensitizer genes. RNA interference (RNAi) screens were performed utilizing an array-based siRNA platform on OCI-P5x and OCI-C5x cell lines. RNAi screens were performed in a 384-well format in triplicate, in independent plates, utilizing robotics instrumentation. OCI-P5x and OCI-C5x cell lines were plated in 384-well plates in 50 ?l per well of complete medium using a WellMate (Matrix Technologies, Canada) and transfected with siRNAs (1.25 pmol/well) 24 hours later using Dharmafect 1 Reagent (Horizon Discovery), with three siRNAs targeting the same gene pooled at equal molarities. The siRNA library was tested in triplicate to establish experimental variability and statistical validity. Cells were treated with vehicle or with rucaparib at IC30 concentration 24 hours following transfection, and the plates were incubated at 37C in a 5% CO2 incubator for 72 and 96 hr for OCI-C5x and OCI-P5x, respectively. Cell viability was measured as a phenotypic endpoint using the Cell-TiterGlo assay (Promega) and raw luminescence detected and quantified with an Envision Multilabel plate reader (PerkinElmer). Raw luminescence values were mock-treatment normalized per plate and plotted for distribution and data mining using a negative control siRNA (non-targeting siRNA) and a positive control siRNA targeting the kinesin motor protein (Kif11). RNAi screens were analyzed using methods in Birmingham et al.2, and Cheung et al.3. SelleckChem custom 395-compound library was purchased from SelleckChem targeting a broad range of cancer-related pathways and containing FDA-approved and tool compounds that target oncogenic processes and include PI3K, HDAC, mTOR, CDK, JAK, and RTK inhibitors (Catalog # L3000; anti-cancer compound library). Single-agent and combination drug screens were performed on OCI-C5x and OCI-P5x cell lines with rucaparib and a 395-compound SelleckChem custom drug library. Drug library working plates were generated as an 8-point concentration curve for all 395 compounds. Final concentrations for drug screening of all compounds range from 0.3 nM - 5 M with DMSO/PBS vehicle at 0.05%. OCI-C5x and OCI-P5x cell lines were seeded at ~30% confluence in 384-well microtiter plates, and at 24 hours the working library (395 drugs; 8-point, maximum final - 5 M) and Rucaparib (OCI-C5x-[10 M], OCIP5x-[20 M]) were added using a CyBio-FeliX liquid handler (Analytik Jena AG), and cells were incubated for 144 hr. Cell viability was determined using CellTiter-Glo 2.0 and a BioTek H4 Synergy plate reader. Single-agent responses were normalized to the solvent concentration (0.05% PBS/DMSO) while the combination drug responses were normalized to the solvent concentration and rucaparib.

This method could be used for better power to detect the molecular mechanisms of breast cancer metastasis.	ctd2_055	Joel S. Bader, Ph.D.	31961880		Statistical Analysis	Breast Cancer		https://github.com/baderzone/invasion_2019		Tumor invasiveness and metastasis risk vary between individuals, and even within a single tumor vary between different regions and cells. Although variation within a tumor introduces clinical challenges, it can also enable within-tumor statistical tests that are powerful because they subtract each patient's individual background. Organoids are used as a model system to probe variation in invasiveness between tumors and within tumors. Invasiveness itself is quantified through spectral analysis of the organoid boundary. A variance components model estimates that between-tumor variation contributes 28% of organoid-to-organoid variation in invasiveness, and within-tumor variation contributes the remaining 72%. Thus, individual organoids are close to independent observations, and, for example, a study of 100 tumors each generating 1000 organoids may have similar power to a bulk study of 10,000 to 100,000 individuals. All data and methods are available at GitHub.	Johns Hopkins University	Joel S. Bader, Ph.D.	joel.bader@jhu.edu

The study summarizes the initial findings of the analyses of ex vivo drug sensitivity. Samples were characterized using whole-exome sequencing and RNA sequencing and this data is available through NCI Genomics Data Commons. These datasets can be leveraged to address clinical, genomic, transcriptomic, and functional analyses of the biology of AML.	ctd2_056	Brian J. Druker, M.D.	30333627		Genomic Sequencing	Leukemia		https://gdc.cancer.gov/about-data/publications/BEATAML1-0-CRENOLANIB-2019		Ex vivo functional drug screens were performed on freshly isolated mononuclear cells. In brief, 10,000 cells per well were arrayed into three, 384-well plates containing 122 small-molecule inhibitors. This panel contained graded concentrations of drugs with activity against two-thirds of the tyrosine kinome as well as other non-tyrosine kinase pathways, including mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), the pathway involving phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase, AKT serine/threonine kinase 1 and mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase (PIK3C-AKT-MTOR); protein kinase AMP-activated (AMPK, also known as PRKAA1), ATM serine/threonine kinase (ATM), aurora kinases, calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CAMKs), cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), serine/threonine protein kinase 3 (GSK3), I?B kinase (I?K), cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), protein kinase C (PKC), polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) and RAF proto-oncogene serine/threonine kinase (RAF). In addition, the library contained small-molecule inhibitors with activity against the BCL2 family, bromodomain containing 4 (BRD4), hedgehog heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), NOTCH/?-secretase, proteasome, survivin, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), histone deacetylase (HDAC), and WNT/?-catenin. Drug plates were created using inhibitors purchased from LC Laboratories and Selleck Chemicals and master stocks were reconstituted in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and stored at ?80 C. Master plates were created by distributing a single agent per well in a seven-point concentration series, created from threefold dilutions of the most concentrated stock resulting in a range of 10 ?M to 0.0137 ?M for each drug (except dasatinib, ponatinib, sunitinib and YM-155, which were plated at a concentration range of 1 ?M to 0.00137 ?M). DMSO-control wells and positive-control wells containing a drug combination of flavopiridol, staurosporine and velcade were placed on each plate, with the final concentration of DMSO ?0.1% in all wells. Daughter plates were created using a V&P Scientific 384-well pin tool head operated by the Caliper Sciclone ALH 3000 and equipped with 0.457-mm diameter, 30-nl, slotted stainless-steel pins (FP1NS30). Daughter and destination plates were sealed with pealable thermal seals using a PlateLoc thermal sealer. Destination plates were stored at ?20 C for no more than three months and thawed immediately before use. Primary mononuclear cells were plated across single-agent inhibitor panels within 24 h of collection. Cells were seeded into 384-well assay plates at 10,000 cells per well in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum (FBS) (10%), L-glutamine, penicillin-streptomycin, and ?-mercaptoethanol (10-4 M). After three days of culture at 37 C in 5% CO2, MTS reagent (CellTiter96 AQueous One; Promega) was added, the optical density was measured at 490 nm, and raw absorbance values were adjusted to a reference blank value and then used to determine cell viability (normalized to untreated control wells). A given sample was run on one or more panels and within each panel, the majority of drugs were run without within-panel replicates. Two steps were performed to harmonize these data before model fitting. First, a 'curve-free' AUC (integration based on fine linear interpolation between the seven data points themselves) was calculated for those runs with within-panel replicates after applying a ceiling of 100 and a floor of 0 for the normalized viability. The maximum change in AUC among the replicates was noted and those runs with differences >100 were removed. Second, the remaining within-plate replicates had their normalized viability averaged subject to a ceiling of 100 and floor of 0. An additional set of 'curve-free' AUCs was computed for sample-inhibitor pairs run on multiple panels. The maximum change in AUC among the across-panel replicates was noted and those runs with differences >75 were removed. At this point, the within- and across-plate replicates for the normalized viability were averaged together and a ceiling of 100 was applied. From the steps above, the floor was already at 0. On the basis of the methodology used in the prior drug-combination study1, a probit regression was fit to all possible run groups using the model: (normalized viability/100) ~ 1 + log10 (concentration). For all groups there were n=7 dose-response measurements. The summary analyses of curve fit were inspected and cut-offs were devised removing all runs with an Akaike information criteria (AIC) > 12 and deviance >2. For inhibitors that were run using multiple concentration ranges, only the most-recent concentration range was kept. Finally, these data were compared to the AUC values from third-order polynomial fits. Those runs that were discrepant in terms of sensitive or resistant calls were manually reviewed as subject to removal.	Oregon Health and Science University	Jeffrey Tyner	tynerj@ohsu.edu

This allowed to identify hyper and hypomethylated genes across colorectal cancer. We specifically focused on hypo-methylated genes and identified 58 genes that are significantly hypo-methylated, have a strong negative correlation between gene expression and DNA methylation, and are highly prevalent in the colorectal TCGA cohort.	ctd2_058	Calvin J. Kuo, M.D., Ph.D.			DNA Methylation	Colon Cancer				To identify key methylation-driven genes, we developed a model-based method called MethylMix that addresses three criteria. First, MethylMix uses a univariate Beta mixture model to identify 'methylation states' for each CpG site (or cluster of correlated CpG sites). Each methylation state is defined by a statistically similar methylation pattern across a large number of patients without relying on arbitrary thresholds and is associated with its nearest gene. Secondly, MethylMix compares the DNA methylation of cancer with normal tissue to determine if a specific gene is differentially methylated in cancer. Since the normal state of DNA methylation is tissue specific, MethylMix incorporates the DNA methylation of normal tissue obtained from a subset of patients in the same tissue to determine if a specific gene is hyper or hypomethylated across each cancer. Next, MethylMix produces a new metric called the 'Differential Methylation value' or 'DM-value' to identify genes that are differentially methylated in cancer relative to normal by leveraging the CpG methylation distribution across an entire patient cohort. Finally, MethylMix defines the methylation state of a gene as 'functional' if its gene expression can sufficiently be predicted by methylation of its CpG sites using a linear regression model.

These engineered ARID1A-deficient organoids mirror several clinicopathologic features of ARID1A-mutant gastric cancer.

Transient transfection of an all-in-one construct expressing both Cas9 and sgRNA targeting TP53 exon 4 followed by a recently developed nutlin-3 functional selection yielded numerous organoid colonies, whereas no growth was seen in non-transfected cells.  After clonal expansion, a nutilin-3-resistant organoid clone harboring a 1 bp cytosine deletion (327delC; TTCCG to TTCG) within TP53 exon 4 was chosen for further analysis. We next applied a dual lentiviral system to ARID1A genetic knockout in the same TP53-null organoids. Briefly, the TP53 KO organoids were transducted with a lentiviral Cas9 construct conferring blasticidin resistance followed by a secondary transduction targeting of ARID1A exon 1 in a lentiviral sgRNA vector with BFP reporter. We established a spectrum of clonal TP53/ARID1A DKO organoid lines. The loss of ARID1A was further confirmed by Sanger sequencing, Western blotting and immunohistochemical (IHC) staining. In parallel, an empty lentiviral sgRNA-BFP vector was transduced into the same Cas9-TP53 KO organoids, and represented the control. The TP53 KO organoids (control) and TP53/ARID1A DKO organoids (ARID1A KO) were established, grown, maintained and passaged using identical culture conditions throughout this study. In this dataset, we investigated ARID1A-associated transcripts by bulk RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) in the control TP53 KO and two of the TP53/ARID1A DKO organoid lines.

We evaluated candidate oncogenic loci identified via integrative computational analysis of extreme copy gains overlapping with extreme expression dysregulation in The Cancer Genome Atlas using organoid modeling. A subset of 'outlier' candidates was contextually screened with lentiviral libraries of tissue-specific cDNAs within cognate esophageal, oral cavity, colon, stomach, pancreas, and pulmonary organoids bearing initial mutations that were attributable to cancer. As a result of iterative analysis, the kinase DYRK2 at 12q15 was identified as an oncogene amplified in p53-/- oral mucosal organoids.

dataset	7d356db1-e1de-5dcc-809c-97b4fbd7cb48	CTD² Network	Screening for Dependencies in Cancer Cell Lines Using Small Molecules	Using cancer cell-line profiling, we established an ongoing resource to identify, as comprehensively as possible, the drug-targetable dependencies that specific genomic alterations impart on human cancers. We measured the sensitivity of hundreds of genetically characterized cancer cell lines to hundreds of small-molecule probes and drugs that have highly selective interactions with their targets, and that collectively modulate many distinct nodes in cancer cell circuitry. Using robust analytical methods, we connected sensitivity measurements to genetic and cellular features of the cell lines in order to identify dependencies conferred by specific genotypes. We developed a growing resource, the Cancer Therapeutics Response Portal (CTRP)Exit Disclaimer, to provide analysis results and visualizations of statistically significant connections and to serve as a hypothesis-generating resource for the cancer biology community. Additionally, we made available all primary data such that it can be re-analyzed to yield further hypotheses as additional computational approaches and deeper genetic and epigenetic characterization of the cancer cell lines become available. Our hope is that insights developed from CTRP, first based on cell line models of cancer and then substantiated in more complex environments, will yield clinical predictions of how patients will respond to novel types of targeted therapies and to accelerate the discovery of new genetically matched medicines.	ctd2_066	Stuart L. Schreiber, Ph.D.	23993102;26482930		Small Molecule Screening	Multiple Cancer Types		https://github.com/remontoire-pac/ctrp-reference		"Informer Set Assembly: Small molecules were selected to perturb potential targets and processes on which cancer cells may become dependent, including but not limited to oncogenes/tumor suppressors, DNA-damage response, reactive-oxygen species metabolism, electrophile-stress response, protein degradation, hypoxic-stress response, mitotic-stress response, survival/apoptosis, nutrient metabolism, nutrient-stress response, chromatin modification, and other major signaling pathways (e.g., PI3K/mTOR; NFkB; others). We performed an evaluation of the probe-development literature including: seminars, peer-reviewed journals, NIH Molecular Libraries Initiative Probe Reports, and patents. Many of our compounds were accessed through synthetic organic chemistry, either externally or with collaborators in the probe-development community. Where multiple probes existed for a target, we prioritized those in clinical development, with stronger selectivity data, or with pharmacokinetic metadata that should enable more rapid drug development. Whenever possible, concentration ranges for each compound were defined by review of literature to ensure plating at the optimal concentration for sensitivity measurements.

Cell-Line Selection: Cancer cell lines (CCLs) were selected from among human cancer cell lines available primarily from public organizations such as ATCC and were drawn from lineages being studied by the NCI's TCGA program and to align with genome-wide genetic perturbation screening efforts funded by NCI (such as lung, haematopoetic/lymphoma, large intestine, and ovarian). Most CCLs have been characterized for global gene expression, gene copy number (amplifications/deletions), somatic mutations in 1,645 cancer genes, and lineage and histological subtypes (see https://portals.broadinstitute.org/ccleExit Disclaimer).

Small-Molecule Sensitivity Profiling: We profiled human CCLs in parallel in 384-well (CTRP v1) or 1536-well (CTRP v2) plates, with each cell line propagated and carefully expanded in its preferred medium. To determine the optimal density for profiling, each CCL underwent an assay-development step with a control compound (staurosporine or MG-132). Cells were plated at the optimal density, compounds were pinned in 8-point (CTRP v1) or 16-point (CTRP v2), 2-fold concentration series, and sensitivity was assayed using CellTiter-Glo, which measures cellular ATP levels as a surrogate for cell number and growth. Raw data were merged with assay metadata, and percent-viability scores were calculated relative to DMSO controls, after which concentration-response curves were fit for percent viability. The areas under percent-viability curves were computed and used as the measure of sensitivity. These data are being analyzed by our Center using a number of computational approaches to relate patterns of sensitivity to cellular and genetic features of CCLs. Connections and visualizations based on these approaches are available via the CTRP websiteExit Disclaimer.

Annotated Cluster Multidimensional Enrichment(ACME) Analysis: For CTRP v2 data, we developed a new data-mining approach, annotated cluster multidimensional enrichment (ACME) analysis. Unlike previous methods, which aim to identify response biomarkers with compounds individually, ACME analysis detects multiple small molecules sharing a common protein target that perform similarly across CCLs. Concurrently, ACME identifies common genetic or cellular features among multiple CCLs that share a pattern of response to small molecules, establishing a connection between the protein target and candidate response biomarkers. See Seashore-Ludlow et al. for computational details.

Correlation Analysis: For CTRP v2 data, we evaluated whether small-molecule sensitivity could be correlated with basal gene-expression levels or copy-number variation to identify new biomarkers of sensitivity, candidate protein targets, or other biological determinants of small-molecule sensitivity. We performed correlation analyses both across all cancer types ('pan-can') as well as within each lineage or subtype for which a sufficient number of CCLs was available. Pearson correlation coefficients were normalized between analyses using Fisher's Z transformation to account for different numbers of CCLs participating in different analyses.

For each condition, possible dependency network structures are enumerated and their likelihoods are computed to represent a probability distribution of dependency networks. The difference between the probability distributions of dependency networks is computed between conditions, and its statistical significance is evaluated with random permutations of condition labels on the samples. For this project, the CTD2 Center at the Translational Genomics Research Institute applied EDDY to the gene expression data of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to reveal the functional difference between the four subtypes of GBM - Proneural (PN), Neural (N), Mesenchymal (MES) and Classical (CL).  The results show that the proposed method can identify novel gene sets that could not be found with Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, which is considered a representative method of considering only differential expressions, while providing many results specific to the subtypes of GBM.	ctd2_068	Michael E.

To study the impact of aberrant gene activity in isolation, they developed an isogenic model of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) using the hormone receptor negative MCF10A non-tumorigenic cell line derived from healthy breast tissue which is diploid and largely devoid of somatic alterations. They created 51 stable cell lines by ectopic expression of wild-type and mutant genes to model the impact of recurrent gene mutation, amplification, and overexpression common in breast and other cancers. These cell lines were used in a drug screen to identify genes which could alter responses to a panel of 90 FDA-approved and emerging clinical compounds. The data represent a quantitative measure of the degree to which aberrant gene expression drives the sensitivity or resistance to compounds.	ctd2_070	Michael McManus, Ph.D.	25501949		Small Molecule Screening	Breast Cancer				To measure the impact of gene activation on cellular responses systematically, they screened their isogenic panel against a library of 90 anti-cancer therapeutics spanning multiple stages of clinical development, with 79% used in at least one clinical trial and targeting a broad variety of canonical cancer pathways and targets. They developed a robust screening method to quantitatively assess the impact of gene expression on drug responses. In this screen, isogenic cells expressing control vector or a gene of interest are plated separately and their relative proliferation after 72 hours of drug treatment is compared by high-content microscopy. Cell numbers from each line and treatment are compared to determine the effect size measured by the fold-change in cell number at the IC50 compared to control, and the significance of the effect over replicates. The p-value of significance was converted to a signed chemical-genetic interaction score (S) with positive values indicating that the expression of the gene drove drug resistance and negative values indicating that the gene caused drug sensitivity as compared to vector controls. The screen had a high correlation of scores across replicates (r=0.618) and an empirical false-discovery rate (FDR) of 1% and 10% at score cutoffs of approximately S=4 and S=2.5, respectively. The quantitative scores for 4,541 gene-drug interactions were determined, and 174 resistance interactions and 97 sensitivity interactions at S=2 were identified, corresponding to a 10% FDR.

Cells were transfected for 24 hr, and then the entire plate was treated with one drug at a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) or DMSO for 72 hr, after which cells were stained with Hoescht 33342 and counted using a Thermo CellInsight high-content microscope. After drug or DMSO treatment, each plate was median centered to 2,000 cells per well to normalize relative proliferation rates. Plates had a minimum internal correlation across the 4 replicate wells of 0.7. Each well in the drug-treated plate was then compared to the same well in the DMSO-treated plate. We observed an overall linear relationship between drug and DMSO plates, indicating that most esiRNAs have no effect on drug sensitivity. Next, the set of 4 normalized replicate values in the DMSO plate was compared to the same in the drug plate, and both the fold change in cell number and the p-value of significance of this difference in medians were calculated using a modified t-test. The S score of genetic interaction is defined by the negative log10 of the t-test p-value and signed with either positive (gene loss drives resistance to drug) or negative (gene loss drives sensitivity to drug) values. False Discovery Rate (FDR) was calculated based on the percentage of negative-control knockdowns (GFP) whose score exceeded a given threshold. The described protocol is available in MATLAB, and code and raw data to recreate the dataset are available at https://github.com/BandyopadhyayLab/.

Mills, M.D., Ph.D.	25284480		Oncogenic Variants	Multiple Cancer Types			PIK3R1 	A high-throughput BaF3 differential cytotoxicity screen was used to examine whether specific mutations in PIK3R1 alter sensitivity towards a collection of 145 compounds targeting major signaling pathways. The normally interleukin 3 (IL3)-dependent BaF3 cells were rendered IL3-independent by stable expression of the mutants. Importantly, growth inhibition or cell death induced by inhibitors can be rescued by exogenous IL3, providing an internal control, or 'counterscreen' for the cytotoxic activity of the compounds. The day before treatment, stable construct expressing BaF3 cells were seeded in 96-well plates in medium with or without IL3. Cells were treated with DMSO or inhibitors (1 nM to 10 ?M) in the presence or absence of IL3 for 72 hours. Cell viability was determined using PrestoBlue (Promega, Madison, WI). Two independent experiments, each in duplicate, were performed. Some of these compounds were also tested in a panel of parental endometrial or ovarian cancer cells. To determine whether pathway activation correlates with drug sensitivity, reverse-phase protein arrays (RPPA) were performed with the BaF3 stable cells in the RPPA Core Facility in MD Anderson Cancer Center. Protein lysates were arrayed on nitrocellulose-coated slides, which were then probed with validated primary antibodies plus biotin-conjugated secondary antibodies. The signal obtained was amplified and visualized. The slides were scanned, analyzed, and quantified to generate spot intensity. Each dilution curve was fitted with a logistic model ('Supercurve Fitting' developed by the Department of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology in MD Anderson Cancer Center, 'https://bioinformatics.mdanderson.org/Exit Disclaimer'). This fits a single curve using all the samples (i.e., dilution series) on a slide with the signal intensity as the response variable and the dilution steps are independent variable. The fitted curve is plotted with the signal intensities both observed and fitted on the y-axis and the log2-concentration of proteins on the x-axis for diagnostic purposes. The protein concentrations of each set of slides were then normalized by median polish, which was corrected across samples by the linear expression values using the median expression levels of all antibody experiments to calculate a loading correction factor for each sample. This assay was used to determine the oncogenic potential of the aberration. Plasmid constructs for expression of the mutants were introduced into BaF3 cells by electroporation. PrestoBlue was then added to assess cell viability. Endometrial cancer cells stably expressing the PIK3R1 mutations were subjected to in vitro functional assays to assess the tumorigenic effects of the mutations and to investigate whether the effects could be blocked by inhibitors. The assays measured cell proliferation indicated by BrdU incorporation and cell apoptosis indicated by DNA fragmentation. The assay was used to evaluate the antitumor effect of inhibitors in vivo. All animal experiments were approved by MDACC's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Animal care was followed according to Institutional guidelines. Endometrial cancer cells or parental OVK18 ovarian cancer cells were injected subcutaneously into female athymic (nu/nu) mice (National Cancer Institute, Fredrick, MD). Treatments began on day 21 post-implantation. Tumor measurements were taken and total tumor volume was estimated. Antitumor effects are expressed as tumor growth inhibition (TGI; treated versus control), calculated by the equation, %TGI=100 ? [100  (T ? T0)/(C ? C0)].

Given the large numbers of somatic mutations typically detected by this approach, a key challenge in the downstream analysis is to distinguish 'drivers' that functionally contribute to tumorigenesis from 'passengers' that occur as the consequence of genomic instability. For this study, the CTD^2 Center at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center implemented a systems biology approach to identify driver cancer genes in endometrial cancers.	ctd2_074	Gordon B.

This 'sensor' cell platform was used to functionally annotate 29 mutations occurring in PIK3CA, which is commonly mutated in breast and other cancer types, including frequent 'hotspot' events (e.g., E545K and H1047R) and other mutations occurring less frequently across the cancer patient population.	ctd2_075	Gordon B. Mills, M.D., Ph.D.	26627007		Oncogenic Variants	Breast Cancer			PIK3CA	Allelic series construction and cell line production: To efficiently engineer PIK3CA expression vectors, they utilized a high-throughput mutagenesis and molecular barcoding (HiTMMoB) platform that permitted simultaneous completion of site-directed mutagenesis and recombination-based cloning of wild-type and mutant PIK3CA cDNAs into the pLenti6.3 V5/DEST (Life Technologies) lentiviral expression vector.  Lentivirus encoding these alleles was used to stably infect MCF10A cells for entry into anchorage-independent growth and proliferation assays as outlined below. Anchorage-independent growth assays: Soft agar assays were performed on 6-well plates in triplicate for cells transduced with pLenti6.3 V5/DEST-PIK3CA virus encoding individual wild-type or mutant alleles. Cells were selected for 5 days with 5.0 ?g/?l blastocidin, and 1  104 cells were mixed thoroughly in cell growth medium containing 0.4% SeaKem LE agarose (Fisher Scientific) in RPMI plus 10% FBS, followed by plating onto bottom agarose prepared with 0.65% agarose in RPMI plus 10% FBS. Each well was allowed to solidify and subsequently covered in 1 ml RPMI plus 10% FBS plus P/S, which was refreshed every 4 days. Colonies were stained with 0.05% (wt/vol) iodonitrotetrazolium chloride (Sigma) and scanned at 1200 dpi using a flatbed scanner for colony quantitation. Proliferation assays: Proliferation assays without growth factors (-insulin, -EGF or -insulin alone) were performed on 96-well opaque tissue culture plates. MCF10A cells expressing individual wild-type and mutant PIK3CA alleles were trypsinized and counted. Cells (300 per well) were resuspended in MEGM media (Lonza) with or without growth factors for daily serial time course growth measurements using Cell-Titer-Glo (Promega) following the manufacturer's recommendations. Values were normalized to Day 0 and then average of all negative controls to calculate fold change at the indicated time points. Ba/F3 IL-less survival assays: Ba/F3 lines were created by cloning PIK3CA variants into pHAGE-DEST-IRES-GFP vector and then infecting Ba/F3 cells by lentiviruses encoding individual wild-type or mutant alleles.  Ba/F3 IL-less survival assays were performed by removing medium after viral infection and culturing cells in low IL3 medium (1:10000 dilution) in duplicates. Cell viability was measured after 7 days using Cell-Titer-Glo (Promega) following the manufacturer's recommendations. Tumor formation assays: For PIK3CA  variant tumorigenesis competition assays,1X105 cells from each of the HMLER cell lines expressing GFP, PIK3CAWT, eight PIK3CA constructs with silent mutations and twenty rare PIK3CA mutants were pooled and re-suspended in a 1:1 solution of Hank's balanced salts and Matrigel (BD Bioscience) and then subcutaneously injected into female nude animals (Harlan, Indianapolis, IN). Tumors were collected at the tumor burden limit described in our IACUC-approved animal protocol at Baylor College of Medicine. Then gDNA obtained and barcode regions were PCR amplified using T3 and V5 primers. After PCR product purification, samples were analyzed by IonTorrent PGM sequencing machine.

Mills, M.D., Ph.D.	29533785		Oncogenic Variants	Multiple Cancer Types				To assess the function of the mutation candidates, two growth-factor-dependent cell models, Ba/F3 and MCF10A cell models, were used. Both cell types stop proliferating and die in the absence of the required factor(s). The rationale is that a 'driver' mutation will confer survival and proliferation advantages to the cells in the absence of required growth factor(s), but 'passenger' mutations will not. The mutation candidates were put into both cell models with various types of controls. First, two experimental negative controls (GFP, mCherry, or Luciferase) and three experimental positive controls (PIK3CA wild-type, M1043I, and H1047R) with different activities (i.e. wild-type < M1043I < H1047R) served as technical controls to check if the experiments performed well. Second, mutations and their corresponding wild-type counterparts were assessed in parallel in the same experiment, the latter of which determined the basal activity of the genes in the cell models. Third, for selected genes, silent and literature-reported driver mutations were used as additional controls to determine the basal and activated activities of the genes, respectively. In total, 1,049 mutations were tested in batches, with up to 33 mutations per batch. In each experiment (i.e. batch), the set of five experimental controls (two negative and three positive) and corresponding wild-type clones were included. Additional silent and gene-specific positive mutations were also included, if available. For each experiment, pHAGE constructs of mutants and wild-type genes were freshly prepared from a single colony and used for generating lentivirus for Ba/F3 and MCF10A transduction. Lentivirus was generated in the LentiX-293T cells by transfecting the pHAGE and two packaging plasmids (psPAX2 and pMD2.G). The medium of the transfected cells was refreshed at 16 hours post-transfection. The virus was harvested at three days post-transfection by filtering with 0.45 M filter. Ba/F3 cells (0.6 million cells) were transduced by spinoculation (centrifugal inoculation) at 1000 g for three hours in the presence of polybrene (final concentration: 8 g/ml). After spinning, cells were resuspended in the Ba/F3 assay medium in a 24-well plate format. For MCF10A cells, 5,000 cells were seeded into 96-well plates one day before transduction and transduced by spinoculation at 906 g for two hours in the presence of polybrene (final concentration: 2.7 g/ml). The medium was refreshed after spinoculation with the MCF10A assay medium. Transduced cells were incubated at 37C for three weeks. Cell viability of Ba/F3 and MCF10A cells were measured at four time points (at intervals of three or four days) during the three-week assay period. The functional annotations of mutations were based on a comparison to the corresponding wild-type clones.	University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center	Prahlad Ram	pram@mdanderson.org

This new library is derived from a diverse collection of marine bacteria (prepared by Dr. John MacMillan, University of Texas Southwestern). Because of the higher potency of natural products observed in previous screening projects, this collection was screened using a limited dose response approach in a viability format (see Experimental Approaches).	ctd2_080	Michael Roth, Ph.D.			Small Molecule Screening	Lung Cancer				Screens were conducted using the Cell Titer Glo assay platform from Promega, Inc.

Using bioinformatics tools, the CTD^2 Center at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center are discovering associations between this functional data (siRNAs) and NSCLC mutational status, methylation arrays, gene expression arrays, and copy number variation data that will help us identify new targets and enrollment biomarkers. 	ctd2_081	Michael Roth, Ph.D.			Small Molecule Screening	Lung Cancer				Two commercial genome wide siRNA libraries from Ambion (library 1; 21,585 genes) and Dharmacon (library 2; 18,175 genes) were purchased in the 96-well plate format. siRNAs were dissolved in 13 siRNA buffer (Dharmacon) overnight to a final concentration of 10 mM and stored at 80C prior to use. Library 1 and 2 are mixes of 3 and 4 individual siRNA oligos/genes, respectively. For the primary and secondary screens, cells were cultured in ACL4 (normal cell lines and HCC4017) with 2% FBS or RPMI medium (all other cancer lines) with 5% FBS. For reverse transfections 10 pmole of each siRNA pool was transferred (3 ml) to serum free media (95 ml/well) in empty 96-well assay plates (Costar). Thirty ?l of this siRNA solution was transferred to an empty 96-well optical assay plate (BioMek), incubated for 5 minutes, then mixed with 10 ml transfection reagent solution (0.13 ml RNAiMax [Invitrogen] in 10 ml serum free medium), and incubated for 15 minutes. Cells were harvested and diluted in parallel (10,000 cells/100 ml), then added to the siRNA-lipid mix and incubated for 96 hours. CellTiter-Glo (Promega) assays were performed using 15 ml reagent/well followed by a 10 minute incubation prior to quantitation of luminescence with an Envision plate reader (PerkinElmer). Primary screen data were normalized by top quantile per plate. Standard Deviations of the triplicate activities were calculated for each gene.

Sources of data include the TCGA serous cystadenocarcinoma (OV) study, the GTEx program surveying gene expression in many normal tissue types, the Illumina BodyMap 2.0 dataset, and the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia. Several additional ovarian tumors were profiled by RNA-seq and ribosome footprinting to assess evidence for translation.	ctd2_087	Christopher Kemp, Ph.D.			Genomic Sequencing	Ovarian Cancer				We applied a consistent splicing-aware short-read processing workflow to all samples, using the same software versions, genome assembly and transcriptome reference sequences for all samples. Summary information about each splice junction, such as the number of supporting reads and maximum number of nucleotides sequenced on either side of each junction, was gathered into a large overview matrix with one row per splicing event and one column per sample. We gathered from public repositories, or generated locally, RNA-seq data from a large number of source tissues including: 100 TCGA OV tumors, 53 local serous cystadenocarcinoma tumors with at least 70% malignant cells, 160 GTEx samples from 26 normal tissues, 16 Illumina BodyMap 2.0 normal tissues (each profiled with single- and paired-end reads), 10 local benign ovarian tumors, and 6 CCLE ovarian cancer cell lines. All data were aligned with TopHat 2.0.9, in conjunction with Bowtie 2.1.0, using the UCSC hg19 human reference assembly as distributed with the Illumina iGenomes release of March 2013. TopHat was allowed to infer unannotated splicing events de novo. To reduce false positive inferences, TopHat was also provided with a collection of known gene models from the same iGenomes hg19 release. The resulting splice-junction summaries, collected from TopHat junctions.bed files, were combined into a single table with one column for each sample and one row for each observed splice junction. Each cell contains the unfiltered count of reads spanning a particular splice junction in a given sample. We apply several filters to suppress inferred splice junctions that are likely to result from misalignment of reads. First we apply a very liberal prevalence and abundance filter, requiring at least two independent samples to support each junction with at least five reads; this excludes junctions supported by only a handful of reads in a small number of samples. We further require that each splice junction alignment be supported by at least 15nt of aligned sequence in each flanking exon; this eliminates many spurious junctions with little alignment support at the cost of excluding a small number of potential alignments involving microexons. Finally, we remove splicing events in regions known to be difficult to resolve correctly without special-purpose software or sample preparation, such as immunoglobulin loci on chromosomes 2, 22, and 14. Each of these steps eliminates predominantly de novo inferred splice junctions. Public mRNA and EST sequence resources provide another rich source of information about splicing in a wide range of tissues, tumors, and cell lines. We have characterized several million such sequences by broad categories of tissue origin (normal tissue, tumor tissue, cell line, or non-cancer disease) and developmental stage (adult, fetal/embryonic, or pooled). Each row in the splice junction array is also annotated with the number of supporting mRNA and EST sequences falling into each of these categories. This information may be used to, for example, exclude splice junctions sampled by ESTs from normal tissue or to provide support for a novel junction inferred by RNA-seq that is also supported by a tumor-derived EST.

To characterize the relative abundance of these variants in large numbers of tissues, we designed custom NanoString nCounter assays to quantify five novel exons and eight novel splice variants of MUC16. Panels also include probes to previously-reported MUC16 exons and splice variants and also to two markers, epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EPCAM) for epithelial cells and Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Receptor Type, C (PTPRC) (CD45) for hematopoietic cells, to help gauge relative amounts of different cell types in each sample. For the NanoString assays presented here, total RNA was extracted from 28 serous ovarian cancer tumors, 1 ovarian cancer cell line (OVCAR3), 8 benign ovarian tumors, and a panel of 16 normal tissues (acquired commercially from Ambion and Agilent). 150ng of Total RNA from each sample was used as input to the standard NanoString Gene Expression Assay protocol. Data presented here are raw counts for each probe in each sample. Two files are provided, one for the exon assay and the other for the splicing assay, since these two assays must be run separately.

These features include per-nucleotide read coverage histograms and read pairs that map discordantly, with its mate being on another chromosome or in an unexpected orientation.	ctd2_089	Christopher Kemp, Ph.D.			Genomic Sequencing	Ovarian Cancer				For locally-derived RNA-seq samples, nearly all of the samples were prepped with the Illumina TruSeq kit and protocol. We started with at least 500ng of total RNA and used the above to capture ployA+ mRNA, fragment the mRNA, convert to double-stranded cDNA, perform end repair, and add the adapters used for cluster generation/sequencing. Local sequence was generated with paired-end 50nt reads. For locally-derived ribosome protected tag sequencing (files with 'RPT' in the names) we used Nextera low-input kits. For all samples, RNA-seq data from locally obtained SOC tissues, benign tumors, and the OVCAR3 cell line were aligned with the TopHat 2.0.9 splice-aware short read aligner, in conjunction with Bowtie 2.1.0.  All alignments used the UCSC hg19 human reference assembly distributed with the Illumina iGenomes release of March 2013. To facilitate comparison, TCGA OV RNA-seq data was downloaded and processed with the same software versions, reference assembly, and reference annotations. For each sample, various features of interest were extracted. One such feature set includes annotated lists of 'discordant mates', where one read in a pair aligns to a gene of interest while its mate aligns to a different gene or even chromosome.  A second set of features is, for each gene and sample of interest, a coverage histogram showing the number of reads covering each nucleotide. Coverage is reported separately for different classes of reads that might suggest a fusion, such as singletons (where a mate does not align) or reads whose mate is in a different gene.

Here we thus explore mechanisms underlying sensitivity and resistance to PARPi using two intrinsically PARPi sensitive (T22) and resistant (T127) syngeneic murine breast cancer models in female mice. We demonstrate that tumor associated macrophages (TAM) potentially contribute to the differential sensitivity to PARPi. By single-cell RNA-sequencing, we identify a TAM_C3 cluster, expressing genes implicated in anti-inflammatory activity, that is enriched in PARPi resistant T127 tumors and markedly decreased by PARPi in T22 tumors. Rps19/C5aR1 signaling is selectively elevated in TAM_C3. C5aR1 inhibition or transferring C5aR1hi cells increases and decreases PARPi sensitivity, respectively. High C5aR1 levels in human breast cancers are associated with poor responses to immune checkpoint blockade. Thus, targeting C5aR1 may selectively deplete pro-tumoral macrophages and engender sensitivity to PARPi and potentially other therapies.	ctd2_093	Gordon Mills, M.D., Ph.D.	38802355		Genomic Sequencing	Breast Cancer			C5aR1	For MDST assays, female FVB mice at 6 weeks of age were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory.

However, toxicity and rapid emergence of resistance have limited their clinical implementation. To identify state changes underlying acquisition of resistance to the JQ1 BETi, we reanalyzed single-cell RNAseq data from JQ1 sensitive and resistant SUM149 and SUM159 triple-negative breast cancer cell lines. Parental and JQ1-resistant SUM149 and SUM159 exhibited a stem cell-like and embryonic diapause (SCLED) cell state as well as a transitional cell state between the SCLED state that is present in both treatment naive and JQ1 treated cells, and a number of JQ1 resistant cell states. A transitional cell state transcriptional signature but not a SCLED state transcriptional signature predicted worsened outcomes in basal-like breast cancer patients suggesting that transit from the SCLED state to drug-resistant states contributes to patient outcomes. Entry of SUM149 and SUM159 into the transitional cell state was characterized by elevated expression of the CD9 tetraspanin. Knockdown or inhibition of CD9-sensitized cells to multiple targeted and cytotoxic drugs in vitro. Importantly, CD9 knockdown or blockade sensitized SUM149 to JQ1 in vivo by trapping cells in the SCLED state and limiting transit to resistant cell states. Thus, CD9 appears to be critical for the transition from a SCLED state into treatment-resistant cell states and warrants exploration as a therapeutic target in basal-like breast cancer.	ctd2_094	Gordon Mills, M.D., Ph.D.	37542044		Genomic Sequencing	Multiple Cancer Types				shRNA (shCD9_1 #TRCN0000296954, shCD9_2 #TRCN0000291711, shCD9_3 #TRCN0000296958, shCON #SHC201) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Lentivirus were packaged in 293?T cell line by cotransfected into 293?T cells with Lentiviral Packaging Mix (#SHP001, Sigma Aldrich). 72?h after co-transfection, 293?T medium with packaged lentivirus was harvested. SUM149, MDAMB231 and MDAMB468 cells were transfected with 293?T medium containing lentivirus by spinning (1000??g) for 2?h at 25?C. Cells were selected in puromycin. SUM149 transfected with shCD9_3 which targets the CD9 3' untranslated region (UTR) was transfected with CD9-mGFP (0.5?ng/?L, Addgene, #182864) that lacks the CD9 3' untranslated region to rescue CD9 expression in SUM149 CD9 knockdown cells. scRNA-seq by 10x genomics of shCD9 or shCON SUM149 tumors growing in NSG mouse after 30 days of 25mg/kg/day JQ1 treatment. For xenograft assays 6 weeks old female NSG (NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ) mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory. Tumors were induced by unilateral orthotopic mammary fat pad injection of 2*106 SUM149 cells transfected with shCON or shCD9 lentivirus and suspended in 50 ?L of culture medium/Matrigel Growth Factor Reduced Basement Membrane Matrix, Phenol Red-Free (Corning, CLS356231) in a 1:1 ratio. After 14 days, mice were randomized to treatment groups (n=8) based on tumor size. tumor was harvested from NSG mouse mamary pad. Tumor tissue was dissociated with gentleMACS tissue dissociation kits (SUM149 xenograft tumors were disaggregated by gentleMACS kits (Miltenyi Biotec, #130-096-730), and incubated in TotelseqA hashtag antibodies (Biolegend, #394601, #394603, #394605, #394607, #394609, #394611, #394613, #394615) following the manufactural instructions. Live cells were isolated by EasySep Dead Cell Removal (Annexin V) Kit (STEMCELL Technologies, #17899). Single cell suspensions were processed according to 10xGenomics scRNAseq sample preparation protocol (Chromium Single Cell 3' v3.1 Reagent Kit, 10xGenomics). 1000 cells were targeted for each sample.) RNA libraries were prepared for sequensing using standard library construction protocol by 10x Genomics. Sequenced reads were demultiplexed by Cell Ranger v6.0.0. Sequenced reads were mapped to GRCh38 whole genome with all transcripts by Cell Ranger v6.0.0 with default parameters. Sequenced reads were mapped to GRCh38 whole genome with only exons by velocyto v0.17.	Oregon Health and Science University	Jun Li	JLi14@mdanderson.org
