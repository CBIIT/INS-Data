"phs003569.v1.p1","Aberrant Activation of Wound Healing Programs within the Metastatic Niche    Facilitates Lung Colonization by Osteosarcoma Cells","Lung metastasis is responsible for nearly all deaths caused by osteosarcoma, the most common pediatric bone tumor. How malignant bone cells coerce the lung microenvironment to support metastatic growth is  unclear. This study delineates how osteosarcoma cells educate the lung microenvironment during metastatic progression.

To evaluate if OPN5 treatment could relieve  fixed chromatin states associated with terminal T-cell dysfunction, ATAC-sequencing was performed on CLL patient T-cells.

"phs003503.v1.p1","ILyAD (Indolent Lymphoma And vitamin D)","Indolent non-Hodgkin lymphomas are incurable diseases, and require intermittent and often morbid and expensive therapy during their prolonged natural history. Lower intensity and better-tolerated, cost-effective treatment strategies are needed for  these patients. Low vitamin D levels at diagnosis of indolent lymphomas are strongly associated with inferior outcomes to treatment.

"phs003462.v1.p1","Tumor detection by analysis of both symmetric- and hemi-methylation of    plasma cell-free DNA","Aberrant DNA methylation plays a critical role in tumorigenesis. While DNA methylation has been used for cancer detection and classification, DNA hemi-methylation, a novel epigenetic mark has not been analyzed  extensively in cancer epigenomes.
