This is true both in international comparisons of rates of ALL in African nations to those elsewhere, and in comparing rate of B-ALL in African-American (AA) children to that in European-American (EA) children in the United States. The inverse association of African ancestry with incidence of B-ALL is independent of established perinatal risk factors for the disease. Moreover, AA children have lower incidence despite having greater exposure to many putatively causal environmental risk factors for B-ALL than do EA children. Common genetic variants established by genomewide association studies incompletely explain the deficit of B-ALL in AA children, suggesting undiscovered contributing genetic factors may be detected by admixture mapping. We have assembled existing DNA samples and data for 930 B-ALL patients with AA ancestry and will additionally accrue ~590 over the life of the project. We will conduct admixture mapping in the assembled group of patients to detect new genetic loci and new variants at established loci associated with occurrence of B-ALL. In addition, we will examine admixture in association with clinical characteristics at diagnosis and survival. Candidate genes/variants will be functionally evaluated through both in silico and in vitro techniques. The proposed research will potentially answer a long- standing mystery by revealing critical genes or loci that explain the comparative deficit of B-ALL in AA compared to EA children.

We have recently revealed critical transcriptional programs downstream of CIC-DUX4 that drive malignant phenotypes, including tumor growth and metastasis. Additionally, recent studies demonstrate that Capicua (CIC) protein expression is directly modulated by the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-signaling pathway. The long-term goal of our laboratory is to identify and dissect the critical molecular pathways that regulate fusion oncoprotein stability and expression in human sarcoma. Our studies will reveal fusion oncoprotein-specific vulnerabilities that can facilitate precision-based therapeutic design to improve outcomes for patients with universally lethal forms of sarcomas. The objective of this proposal is to fuse our expertise in Capicua (CIC) biology and MAPK signaling to develop the first precision-based therapeutic approach for CIC-DUX4 sarcomas. We hypothesize, that genetic or pharmacologic MAPK activation will lead to the degradation of the CIC-DUX4 oncoprotein. Our rationale is based on our prior studies demonstrating MAPK-mediated regulation of wild-type (non-fused) CIC protein expression in the context of human cancer. Our specific aims will test the following hypotheses: (Aim 1) human ERK physically interacts with nuclear CIC-DUX4; (Aim 2) MAPK-ERK pathway activation decreases CIC-fused oncoprotein stability, leading to degradation; and (Aim 3) pharmacologic activation of the MAPK pathway decreases tumor cell survival through rapid degradation of the CIC-DUX4 fusion oncoprotein. The significance of these findings are highly impactful, as there are no effective therapeutic strategies to target CIC- DUX4 sarcomas, which remain lethal in the metastatic setting.

The long-term goal of the Mosse and Maris translational research programs is to substantively improve neuroblastoma cure rates by developing patient-specific therapies that target the unique oncogenic drivers of each case. Within the context of the National Cancer Institute's Pediatric In Vivo Testing Program (Ped-In Vivo-TP) we propose a Neuroblastoma Research Program built on richly annotated and highly characterized patient derived xenograft (PDX) and other recently developed murine models of this disease. The central hypothesis to be tested in this Program is that neuroblastoma-specific oncogenic drivers and optimal immunotherapeutic targets can be defined and exploited through rationally designed therapies based on validated and clinically measurable biomarkers. Through our dedicated focus on neuroblastoma and our central role in the former Pediatric Preclinical Testing Program and Consortium, we have developed an investigative team and rich set of resources and reagents to be uniquely positioned to achieve the goals of the Ped-In Vivo-TP. Here we propose to use a large (and growing) collection of PDX models that have been fully characterized with the most modern genomic technologies to address the challenge of prioritizing the large armamentarium of anti-cancer agents in development so that early phase biomarker-driven clinical trials can be designed with the objective of showing potent and specific anti-tumor activity. We propose three specific aims directed towards 1) developing and characterizing highly annotated models of human neuroblastoma; 2) performing preclinical trials with drugs directed against defined therapeutic vulnerabilities in order to prioritize agents for the clinic, and 3) developing the portfolio of preclinical data required for design of clinical trials with robust biomarkers for patient selection and monitoring. In collaboration with other preclinical testing programs, we will seek to determine if discoveries in our program are relevant to other childhood cancers and collaborate across disease groups on clinical development strategies. Thus, this Program will seek to shift the paradigm for how high-risk neuroblastoma patients are treated with the goal of substantively improving the outcomes, both in terms of cure rates, but also by decreasing the toxicity associated with current standards of care.",Address;Adolescent;Adrenocortical carcinoma;Adult;Allografting;Antineoplastic Agents;Biological Assay;Biological Markers;Caring;Cause of Death;Cessation of life;Chemotherapy and/or radiation;Child;Child Development;Childhood;Clinic;Clinical;Clinical Trials;Clinical Trials Design;Collaborations;Collection;Communities;Coupled;Data;Development;Diagnosis;Disease;Disease model;Drug Modelings;Drug Targeting;Foundations;Funding;Genetic Fingerprintings;Genetic Predisposition to Disease;Genomics;Glioma;Goals;Health;Immunooncology;Immunotherapeutic agent;Immunotherapy;In Vitro;Industry;Inflammatory Pseudotumor;Infrastructure;Ki-1 Large-Cell Lymphoma;Knowledge;Leadership;MYCN gene;Malignant Childhood Neoplasm;Malignant Neoplasms;Measurable;Mission;Modeling;Modernization;Molecular;Morbidity - disease rate;Mus;National Cancer Institute;Neoplasm Metastasis;Neuroblastoma;Oncogenic;Patient Monitoring;Patient Selection;Patients;Pediatric Oncology;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacology;Phase;Play;Positioning Attribute;Pre-Clinical Model;Preclinical Testing;Public Health;Radiation therapy;Reagent;Recurrent disease;Relapse;Research;Resource Sharing;Resources;Role;Sampling;Series;Solid;Solid Neoplasm;Survivors;Technology;Testing;Therapeutic;Therapeutic Intervention;Therapeutic Trials;Toxic effect;Translating;Treatment Failure;United States National Institutes of Health;Work;anticancer research;base;biomarker-driven;chemotherapy;clinical development;companion diagnostics;design;disorder risk;drug testing;early phase clinical trial;evidence base;high risk;human model;improved;improved outcome;in vivo;in vivo evaluation;individualized medicine;infancy;innovation;melanoma;mouse model;next generation sequencing;novel;novel therapeutics;patient biomarkers;patient derived xenograft model;pre-clinical;preclinical trial;programs;public-private partnership;rare condition;refractory cancer;response;screening;targeted treatment;therapy design;tool;translational research program;tumor,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,PHILADELPHIA,PA,UNITED STATES,Yael P Mosse,Malcolm M Smith,712800,712800,2021-06-24,2021-07-01,2026-06-30,RFA-CA-20-034,True duplicate in all columns.

Accordingly, there is a pressing need for clinically relevant preclinical studies that can help prioritize pediatric indications for clinical application of nearly the entire universe of cancer drugs currently in development. To meet this need, we established a preclinical testing program that has created >300 genomically-characterized pediatric solid tumor patient- derived xenograft (PDX) models between the pediatric oncology programs at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and University of California San Francisco. We propose to leverage this large portfolio of models across a diversity of diseases, along with the deep expertise of the team, to establish a NCI Pediatric In Vivo Testing Program (Ped-In Vivo-TP) Research Team focused on pediatric bone and soft tissue sarcomas, renal tumors, desmoplastic small round cell tumor (DSRCT) and other rare pediatric solid tumors. The Aims of this Research Team are: Aim 1. Integrate with the Coordinating Center and other Research Teams to prioritize agents for preclinical evaluation. We will leverage our team's translational expertise as well as existing connections to disease committees within cooperative groups to inform and facilitate new agent selection and preclinical evaluation in appropriate models to prioritize agents to advance into pediatric oncology clinical trials. Aim 2. Utilize PDX portfolios representative of disease heterogeneity to assess therapeutic agents. We will utilize the >300 PDX models from MSKCC and UCSF, supplemented with models from the PROXC consortium where necessary, to assess 8-10 therapeutic agents/year using study designs matched to the therapeutic question. All preclinical drug testing will be conducted at MSKCC. Aim 3. Align central and local data analyses to ensure rigor in results reporting. For the purposes of prioritization, we will maintain equipoise in validating ('go') or invalidating ('no go') therapeutic hypotheses, and will complement central data analyses with advanced local biostatistical expertise. Aim 4. Translational biomarker discovery. We will leverage the combined expertise of our Research Team to identify clinically translatable biomarkers predictive of enhanced response or drug resistance. In some cases, predictive biomarkers may not be genetic, but instead will depend on transcriptional or protein-based assays of target activity. In other cases, genomically identified biomarkers have to be translated to clinically utilizable assays. Together, the expertise and capabilities of this Research Team will support the rigorous evaluation of novel therapeutic hypotheses in clinically-representative models to enable prioritization and translation of the most promising emerging agents into biomarker-informed clinical trials for children with high risk solid tumors.",Adoption;Antineoplastic Agents;Biological Assay;Biological Markers;Biometry;Bone Tissue;California;Cancer Biology;Cancer Model;Cause of Death;Cell Line;Characteristics;Child;Childhood;Childhood Solid Neoplasm;Clinical;Clinical Trials;Complement;Coupled;Cytotoxic Chemotherapy;Data Analyses;Death Rate;Desmoplastic Small Round Cell Tumor;Development;Disease;Drug resistance;Ensure;Equipoise;Evaluation;Excision;Failure;Genetic;Genetic Transcription;Genomics;Growth;Histologic;In Vitro;Inter-tumoral heterogeneity;Kidney Neoplasms;Light;Malignant Childhood Neoplasm;Malignant Neoplasms;Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center;Methodology;Modeling;Mus;New Agents;Operative Surgical Procedures;Outcome;Patients;Pediatric Oncology;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Preclinical Testing;Predictive Value;Proteins;Radiation therapy;Refractory;Relapse;Reporting;Research;Research Design;San Francisco;Serial Passage;Soft tissue sarcoma;Solid Neoplasm;Therapeutic;Therapeutic Agents;Time;Translating;Translations;United States;Universities;Xenograft Model;Xenograft procedure;advanced disease;base;biomarker discovery;biomedical referral center;cancer clinical trial;childhood sarcoma;clinical application;clinical development;clinical translation;clinically relevant;clinically translatable;conventional therapy;curative treatments;disease heterogeneity;disorder risk;drug development;drug testing;early phase clinical trial;effective therapy;established cell line;experience;high risk;improved;in vivo;in vivo evaluation;molecular drug target;novel therapeutics;oncology program;patient derived xenograft model;patient population;patient response;pre-clinical;preclinical evaluation;preclinical study;predictive marker;programs;response;sarcoma;targeted treatment;treatment response;tumor;tumor xenograft,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,NEW YORK,NY,UNITED STATES,Filemon S Dela Cruz;Andrew L Kung,Malcolm M Smith,749282,749282,2021-06-23,2021-07-01,2026-06-30,RFA-CA-20-034,True duplicate in all columns.

For children with recurrent disease, survival is below 30%, and long-term survivors have an increased burden of disease associated with the curative therapies they received. Therefore, the goal of our research team is to improve the survival and quality of life of children with STS by integrating basic, translational, and clinical research. For the past 10 years, we have consented STS and other solid tumor patients to donate tissue for orthotopic implantation into immunocompromised mice to develop orthotopic patient derived xenografts (O-PDXs). Our O-PDXs have been used for ex vivo high- throughput drug screening and in vivo testing using a standardized preclinical phase I, II, III paradigm. Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is the most common STS in children and genomic studies have shown that rare subsets of clonally related cells can survive treatment and contribute to disease recurrence. Subsequent integrated analyses using transcriptomic, epigenetic and proteomic data showed that RMS tumors retain lineage-specific transcriptional and epigenetic signatures of their developmental origins. More recently, single cell and single nucleus RNA-seq (sc/snRNA-seq) and in vivo lineage-tracing showed that clones of cells can transition through their normal developmental programs. Indeed, single- cell ATAC-seq demonstrated that the cell- and developmental stage-specific super-enhancer activity is correlated with those clonal changes in gene expression. Chemotherapy eliminates the most proliferative tumor cell populations, and the surviving dormant tumor cells rapidly expand and re- establish their developmental hierarchy, which leads to disease recurrence. This is a striking example of the complex cell-intrinsic and -extrinsic signaling within STS and the intricate connection between developmental and oncogenic pathways in childhood cancer. In this proposal, we will perform in vivo testing for 8-10 drugs per year using our STS O-PDX models. The most compelling pathways are developmental kinase pathways (Aim 1), cell stress pathways (Aim 2) and G2/M cell cycle checkpoints (Aim 3). Novel drug combinations will be tested as well as those that include conventional chemotherapy for standard of care. Particular emphasis will be placed on eliminating all the clones in the tumor to improve survival by reducing disease recurrence.",ATAC-seq;Affect;Area;Basic Science;Biology;Cell Cycle Checkpoint;Cell Line;Cell Nucleus;Cells;Cellular Stress;Charge;Child;Childhood Soft Tissue Sarcoma;Childhood Solid Neoplasm;Clinical;Clinical Research;Clinical Trials;Clinical Trials Cooperative Group;Clone Cells;Communication;Complex;Consent;DNA Damage;DNA Repair;Data;Data Analyses;Dependence;Development;Disease;Dose;Drug Combinations;Drug Kinetics;Enhancers;Ensure;Epigenetic Process;Etiology;Evaluation;Exhibits;FRAP1 gene;G2/M Checkpoint Pathway;Gene Expression;Genetic Transcription;Genomics;Goals;Government;Health;Homeostasis;Human;Immunocompromised Host;Journals;Long-Term Survivors;Malignant Childhood Neoplasm;Mitotic;Modeling;Mus;Nature;Oncogenic;Pathway interactions;Patients;Persons;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacodynamics;Phase;Phosphotransferases;Population;Positioning Attribute;Preclinical Testing;Proteomics;Publishing;Quality of life;Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases;Recurrence;Recurrent disease;Reporting;Research;Research Proposals;Rhabdomyosarcoma;Saint Jude Children&apos;s Research Hospital;Schedule;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;Small Nuclear RNA;Soft tissue sarcoma;Solid Neoplasm;Somatic Mutation;Standardization;Testing;Tissues;Translating;Translational Research;anticancer research;base;burden of illness;cancer cell;cellular targeting;chemotherapy;clinically relevant;curative treatments;drug use screening;experience;genomic data;high-throughput drug screening;implantation;improved;improved outcome;in vivo;in vivo evaluation;molecular targeted therapies;neoplastic cell;next generation;novel drug combination;novel therapeutics;patient derived xenograft model;pre-clinical;programs;response;standard of care;therapeutic target;transcriptome sequencing;transcriptomics;tumor;tumor heterogeneity,ST.

grant,1U01CA263981-01,U01CA263981,10300383,2021,"A Testing Program to Identify Novel Agents for Treatment of Pediatric and AYA High-Risk Sarcoma, Kidney and Liver Cancer","ABSTRACT Cancer in children is rare with approximately 15,700 new cases diagnosed annually in children 21 years or younger in the U.S. Through use of multimodality therapy (surgery, radiation therapy, and aggressive chemotherapy), 70% of patients will be `cured' of their disease, and 5-year Event-Free Survival (EFS) exceeds 80%. Consequently, the number of patients that can be enrolled in phase I/II clinical trials is small, and most patients will have been extensively treated, hence drug/radiation resistant. Thus, preclinical studies that accurately translate into effective clinical therapy are an essential component of pediatric drug development. Our group has contributed to studies in the PPTP/C that have led to clinical studies through Children's Oncology Group (COG). Of importance, we have developed and characterized over 330 Patient Derived Xenografts (PDX), developed from tumors both at diagnosis and relapse, that can be used to facilitate pediatric drug development as directed by FDA under the Research to Accelerate Cures and Equity for Children Act (RACE for Children Act). Based on our studies, both in and outside the PPTC, we propose to use PDX/CDX models of sarcoma, kidney cancer, and hepatoblastoma derived from high-risk patients to identify novel agents and combinations, and to test at least 8-10 agents per year, for which we have expertise. We will explore specific hypotheses to integrate molecular-targeted agents with conventional chemo-radiation treatment, advanced drug delivery systems (antibody-drug conjugates, nanoparticles), and the use of Single Mouse Testing (SMT) as the primary screening approach. In collaborative studies, we will evaluate a new humanized mouse model where testing of immuno-oncology agents is a priority to treat these PDX models. One of the objective limitations of PPTP/C testing was that relatively few tumor models representing a specific disease (n=3-8/disease) could be used within the resource constraints, a number clearly insufficient to recapitulate the genetic/epigenetic heterogeneity of each clinical disease. Our retrospective analysis of PPTP data, and recent prospective testing in the PPTC, shows that a single mouse/tumor line gives essentially similar data to conventional testing' (using 10 mice/group for each tumor line). The advantage of the SMT design is that it allows for incorporation of up to 20-fold more models, more accurately representing the genetic/epigenetic diversity of each pediatric cancer within the same resource constraints. The proposed studies will adopt SMT as the primary screening approach to identify agents that have biologically meaningful activity (i.e. large antitumor effects) and identify tumors that are `exceptional responders' for validation. The SMT approach, when linked to the molecular characterization of PDX models, potentially increases the power to identify biomarkers associated with response. Using SMT we can essentially conduct preclinical phase II trials and simulate the likely clinical response rate more accurately for a given disease.

Precision medicine holds great promise for these kids, but matching children to available clinical trials remains a challenge due a lack of up-to-date information and highly complex eligibility criteria based on clinical information and genomic and immunophenotype biomarker data. In collaboration with The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, the Pediatric Cancer Data Commons (PCDC) team has developed GEARBOx (Genomic Eligibility Algorithm at Relapse for Better Outcomes), a clinical trial matching tool to allow clinicians to quickly find potential matches for their patients with relapsed or refractory acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). We now endeavor to expand GEARBOx to include several more tumor types, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia, neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, and osteosarcoma. Additionally, we will augment the often-manual abstraction of eligibility criteria from clinical trials with new automated methods. The information available to clinicians about trials will be supplemented to include critical data for how to quickly and efficiently enroll a child on a matched study. Finally, the PCDC team will partner with a third-party flow cytometry lab (Hematologics) to create ways to automatically pull and incorporate structured immunophenotype data directly into the GEARBOx tool. These enhancements will greatly enhance the process of finding appropriate clinical trials for patients and then getting them enrolled, thus improving access to critical precision therapy for these children.",3-Dimensional;Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia;Acute Myelocytic Leukemia;Agreement;Algorithms;Biological Markers;Cancer Relapse;Caring;Characteristics;Chicago;Child;Clinical;Clinical Data;Clinical Trials;Collaborations;Community Clinical Oncology Program;Complex;Data;Data Commons;Data Sources;Development;Disease;Eligibility Determination;Enrollment;Ewings sarcoma;Exclusion Criteria;Feedback;Flow Cytometry;Genomics;Hematology;Immunophenotyping;Improve Access;International;Logic;Malignant Childhood Neoplasm;Malignant Neoplasms;Manuals;Measures;Methods;Monitor;Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial;Multiomic Data;Natural Language Processing;Neuroblastoma;Outcome;Patients;Pediatric Oncologist;Pediatric Oncology;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacologic Substance;Precision therapeutics;Process;Protocols documentation;Rare Diseases;Recurrent disease;Refractory;Refractory Disease;Relapse;Research Personnel;Resources;Rhabdomyosarcoma;Site;Societies;Solid Neoplasm;Source;Structure;Supervision;System;Testing;Time;Universities;Visualization;Work;base;chemotherapy;cooperative study;data sharing;improved;improved outcome;leukemia/lymphoma;novel therapeutics;osteosarcoma;precision medicine;refractory cancer;success;targeted therapy trials;tool;tumor;unsupervised learning;usability,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,CHICAGO,IL,UNITED STATES,Samuel Volchenboum,Anita H.

To coordinate the activities of the new Ped-In Vivo-TP initiative, we have assembled a team of investigators from The Jackson Laboratory (JAX) and Seven Bridges Genomics (SB) with unique combined expertise and experience with in vivo cancer models, scalable cloud-based data management and analysis systems, informatics resource development, and multi-site project coordination. Combining the complementary strengths of JAX and SB provides the ideal foundation for a coordinating center to maximize the short- and long-term impacts of the Pediatric In Vivo Testing Program for advancing the application of precision medicine in pediatric oncology. We will manage a comprehensive and cohesive testing program to advance precision medicine in pediatric oncology through effective public-private partnerships among pharmaceutical companies, regulatory agencies, funders, and research organizations. We will achieve this goal through the following aims: Aim 1: Establish and maintain the Pediatric In Vivo Testing Coordinating Center (PIVOT CC) to provide administrative and logistical support for diverse stakeholders in the Pediatric in Vivo Testing Program consortium. We will draw on our team's combined decades of experience with multi-site program management, cancer model development, standardized testing of in vivo cancer models, data management and analysis, and informatics resource development to ensure timely decision making, conformance to standard protocols, resource tracking, and effective communications within the Ped-In Vivo-TP. Aim 2: Provide data management, statistical, and bioinformatics support to ensure data security and integrity. We will leverage existing protocols and software systems at JAX and SB to identify relevant in vivo cancer models and to collect, analyze, and securely manage data generated from testing centers within the consortium. We will perform statistical and bioinformatic analyses on consortium data to reliably inform the evaluation of the efficacy of novel therapeutic agents in a pediatric oncology setting. We will develop a public- facing data portal for sharing of data and methods with the broader scientific community. Aim 3: Provide scientific coordination to maintain an efficient and effective preclinical testing pipeline. We will draw from the extensive experience of our team with in vivo pharmacology and coordination of similar consortia to manage and coordinate the testing of agents by the Ped-In Vivo-TP centers at all stages of the process, from the identification of relevant in vivo models to the generation of final technical reports and publication of results.

Recent US Government legislation, combined with the relative rarity and higher cure rates of childhood cancer compared with adults, emphasize the importance of new agent preclinical testing programs aimed at maximizing the likelihood that only the most active drugs will be advanced into early phase clinical trials. The broad aim of this application is to improve the treatment options for children with aggressive and/or drug resistant ALL by prioritizing new drugs for clinical trials in the disease using state-of-the-art preclinical experimental models. This aim will be accomplished using a large panel of 90 pediatric ALL patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) that have undergone a high level of cell and molecular characterization and authentication. The PDXs to be used in this study were all established as models of orthotopic disease in immune- deficient (NOD/SCID or NSG) mice from direct patient explants without prior ex vivo culture. The PDXs develop as systemic disease in NSG mice and infiltrate the same major organs in mice as the primary disease in human patients. Engraftment and responses to treatment are monitored by measuring the proportion of human leukemia cells in the peripheral blood of mice on a weekly basis, which provides a reliable representation of overall leukemia burden in the animals. Where luciferase-expressing PDXs are available, this testing will be augmented by bioluminescence imaging of animals. The broad methodology will involve inoculation of PDX cells into NSG mice, a lag time to allow the disease to establish, followed by drug treatment and monitoring to assess drug responses. Methods of response evaluation have been developed using stringent criteria modeled after the clinical setting, in order to minimize the likelihood of over-predicting drug responses in mice leading to failure of drugs in the clinic. The proposed drug testing will adopt multiple formats, including conventional drug testing (6- 10 mice/group), single-mouse trial testing (1 PDX x 1 mouse x 1 drug) and testing of new agents in combination with standard-of-care drugs. In this fashion, this Research Program aims to test 8-10 new agents per year. By completing the major objectives outlined in this proposal, the long term health benefit aims to improve the treatment options and quality of life for children with aggressive forms of ALL who would otherwise succumb to their disease.",Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia;Adopted;Adult;Advisory Committees;Animals;Aspirate substance;B-Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia;Biopsy;Bone Marrow;Cancer Patient;Cells;Characteristics;Child;Childhood;Childhood Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia;Clinic;Clinical;Clinical Trials;Data;Diagnosis;Disease;Drug Combinations;Drug Kinetics;Drug Monitoring;Drug resistance;Engraftment;Ensure;Evaluation;Experimental Models;Exposure to;Failure;Foundations;Funding;Future;Gene Expression Profiling;Government;Health Benefit;Heterogeneity;Human;Immune;Industry Collaboration;Infant;Lesion;Leukemic Cell;Liver;Luciferases;MLL-rearranged leukemia;Malignant Childhood Neoplasm;Manuscripts;Measures;Methodology;Methods;Modeling;Molecular;Monitor;Mus;Mutation;New Agents;Organ;Outcome;Outcomes Research;PTPRC gene;Patients;Performance;Ph+ ALL;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacodynamics;Pharmacotherapy;Philadelphia Chromosome;Play;Preclinical Testing;Preparation;Publications;Quality Control;Quality of life;Relapse;Reproducibility;Research;Research Personnel;Resources;Role;SNP genotyping;Schedule;Spleen;Statutes and Laws;Structure;Systemic disease;T-Lymphocyte;Tail;Testing;Time;Toxic effect;Transplantation;United States National Institutes of Health;Variant;Veins;animal imaging;bioluminescence imaging;clinical development;cost estimate;design;drug response prediction;drug testing;early phase clinical trial;exome sequencing;experience;experimental study;flexibility;follow-up;high risk;improved;improved outcome;in vivo;in vivo evaluation;lentivirally transduced;leukemia;novel;novel therapeutics;patient derived xenograft model;peripheral blood;pre-clinical;programs;public-private partnership;response;standard of care;transcriptome sequencing;treatment response,UNIVERSITY OF NEW SOUTH WALES,SYDNEY,,AUSTRALIA,Richard B Lock,Malcolm M Smith,454976,454976,2021-08-17,2015-08-01,2026-06-30,RFA-CA-20-034,True duplicate in all columns.

Our lab's long- term mission is to identify novel molecular targets in osteosarcoma via comprehensive genomic and proteomic profiling of patient-derived cell lines and xenografts as well as human tumors with the ultimate goal of identifying and/or developing and testing therapeutics against these targets. To achieve this goal, we have a) built a robust profiling platform to identify novel targets; b) expanded our repertoire of osteosarcoma patient derived xenograft (PDX) models to reflect disease heterogeneity; and c) conducted high-throughput in vivo testing of 8-10 new agents each year both as part of Pediatric Preclinical Testing Consortium (PPTC) as well as independent of it. All of these efforts form the basis of our current research proposal and place us strongly poised to successfully achieve our goals. Our overall objective is to efficiently evaluate the efficacy of new agents with high potential to have activity in osteosarcoma based on target data from our genomic and proteomic profiling both as single agents and in rational combinations, with the vision of moving effective agents into clinical trials through the Children's Oncology Group. We have three specific aims- 1) to select and test agents in vivo against surface targets identified by comprehensive proteomic profiling of osteosarcoma xenografts and patient tumors; 2) to select and test agents in vivo against targets identified by comprehensive genomic profiling of osteosarcoma xenografts and patient tumors; and 3) to perform testing of rationally combined agents based on target, toxicity and efficacy data of single agents. Agents from the PPTC pipeline will be selected based on either the proteomic target or genomic alteration being present in at least a subset of available osteosarcoma PDX models. The agent will be tested in selected cohorts of low/ high expressing protein target or present/ absent genomic alteration. In cases with multiple models with target expression, 3-5 mice per model will be used and in cases with few models available, 8-10 mice per model will be used for control and experiment groups with an overall n per arm per experiment of approximately 30 mice. Standard PPTC procedures will be used for tumor implantation and treatment. Tumor dimensions will be measured twice a week and response quantified as per standard PPTC definitions of complete response, maintained complete response, partial response, stable disease and progressive disease. For combination studies, three potential types of combinations will be considered based on efficacy and toxicity data- a) two surface protein targeted agents such as two antibody-drug conjugates; 2) two molecularly targeted agents and 3) a surface protein targeted agent and a molecularly targeted agent.

Specifically, we propose to continue the in vivo testing program for central nervous system (CNS) tumors using our panel of patient derived orthotopic xenograft (PDOX) models. Brain tumor is the leading cause of cancer-related death in children. One of the challenges in clinical drug development is how to effectively prioritize drug candidates to ensure clinical success in cancer patients. However, efforts in identifying new anti-cancer agents for that are most likely to be effective in the clinic have been blocked for many years due to the lack of clinically relevant and molecularly accurate model system. Fortunately, we have established a panel of 150 PDOX models of pediatric brain tumors through direct injection of patient tumor specimens into the brains of SCID mice. These PDOX models are shown to have replicated the histopathology and major genetic abnormalities of the original patient tumors even during serial sub-transplantations in vivo in mouse brains. They not only represent different clinical stage (i.e., at diagnosis, relapse and terminal/autopsy) but also replicate a broad spectrum of the newly identified molecular subtypes of nearly all types of pediatric brain tumors. The xenograft tumor cells can also be cryopreserved for sustained and on-demand supply of tumorigenic PDOX cells. This capacity combined with our optimized surgical procedure, with which we can implant up to 260 mice per day, makes it possible for us to test multiple (e.g., 6-10) drugs per year for every tumor type. Our objective is therefore to make use of this unique panel of PDOX models to examine therapeutic efficacy of new agents and to analyze mechanisms of action and therapy resistance in high grade glioma, medulloblastoma, ependymoma, DIPG and ATRT. Our hypothesis is that these patient-specific PDOX tumors will respond to anti-cancer therapies similarly to the corresponding human primary tumors, and the effective agents identified through this system would have better chances of clinical success. To test this hypothesis, we will perform a series of in vitro and in vivo assays to achieve the following aims: 1) to identify genetically accurate candidate PDOX models that bear the therapeutic target(s) of new investigational drugs through data mining of our mouse model molecular characterization databases; 2) to select the most responsive models through functional in vitro screening to determine time- and dose-responses; 3) to demonstrate therapeutic efficacy of new investigational drugs in multiple target-bearing PDOX models; and 4) to perform detailed analysis of cellular and molecular mechanisms of cell killing as well as the causes of therapy resistance both in vitro and in vivo. Our novel panel of PDOX mouse models represents a broad spectrum of genetic abnormalities of pediatric CNS tumors. All the assays are well established and routinely performed in our laboratory; we are uniquely positioned to accomplish the proposed drug studies in vivo.

Relatively few driver mutations actually alter the function of proteins in tumor cells, whereas most mutations are considered to be functionally neutral passenger mutations. Over the past decade, the search for cancer driver mutations has focused on coding regions and several mutational significance algorithms have been developed for coding mutations. The contribution of mutations in noncoding regulatory regions to tumor formation largely remains unknown and current mutational significance algorithms are not designed to detect driver mutations in noncoding regions, due to biological differences between coding and noncoding mutations. The emerging availability of large whole- genome sequencing datasets (e.g. PCAWG and HMF datasets) creates an ample opportunity to develop new mutational significance algorithms that are particularly designed for the interpretation of noncoding regions. Recently, we have developed a new statistical approach that identifies driver mutations in coding regions based on the nucleotide context. Critically, consideration of the nucleotide context around mutations does not require prior knowledge for functional consequences associated with these mutations. Hence, we hypothesize that generalizing our nucleotide context model to noncoding regions will uncover novel noncoding driver mutations that cannot be detected using the mutational significance approaches currently available. For this purpose, we will develop a statistical framework that incorporates the biological differences between coding and noncoding mutations and that is specifically designed to detect driver mutations in noncoding regions. Specifically, we will consider the context-dependent distribution of passenger mutations, modeling of the background mutation rate, accurately partition the background mutation rate, model the sequence composition of the reference genome, and account for coverage fluctuation. We will then combine these statistical components by computing an independent product of their underlying probabilities. We will derive a significance p-value using a Monte-Carlo simulation approach, and use FDR for multiple hypothesis test correction. This strategy will allow us to accurately estimate the significance of somatic mutations in noncoding genomic regions. We will next apply this statistical framework to whole-genome sequencing data of 5,523 tumor patients, thereby deriving a comprehensive list of candidate driver mutations in noncoding regions. Finally, we will investigate whether noncoding mutations are overrepresented in transcription factor binding sites, regulate gene expression levels, induce alternative splicing, or affect epigenomic states. Upon the completion of this project, we will have developed and applied a statistical framework for discovery of significant somatic mutations in noncoding regions, and defined the mutational landscape of the non-coding cancer genome.

With the recent successful expansion of the cohort to include survivors diagnosed and treated over three decades (1970-1999), the CCSS is the world's largest established open resource for survivorship research with 35,923 eligible survivors available for investigation of late mortality, and 24,368 participants who have contributed health-related and quality of life outcomes. The resource includes comprehensive annotation of treatment exposure, ongoing longitudinal follow-up and an established biorepository, from which genotyping (SNP array) and sequencing (whole exome) of almost 6,000 survivors will be available for investigators for identification of genetic susceptibility for disease- and treatment-induced late effects.

Recent US Government legislation, combined with the relative rarity and higher cure rates of childhood cancer compared with adults, emphasize the importance of new agent preclinical testing programs aimed at maximizing the likelihood that only the most active drugs will be advanced into early phase clinical trials. The broad aim of this application is to improve the treatment options for children with aggressive and/or drug resistant ALL by prioritizing new drugs for clinical trials in the disease using state-of-the-art preclinical experimental models. This aim will be accomplished using a large panel of 90 pediatric ALL patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) that have undergone a high level of cell and molecular characterization and authentication. The PDXs to be used in this study were all established as models of orthotopic disease in immune- deficient (NOD/SCID or NSG) mice from direct patient explants without prior ex vivo culture. The PDXs develop as systemic disease in NSG mice and infiltrate the same major organs in mice as the primary disease in human patients. Engraftment and responses to treatment are monitored by measuring the proportion of human leukemia cells in the peripheral blood of mice on a weekly basis, which provides a reliable representation of overall leukemia burden in the animals. Where luciferase-expressing PDXs are available, this testing will be augmented by bioluminescence imaging of animals. The broad methodology will involve inoculation of PDX cells into NSG mice, a lag time to allow the disease to establish, followed by drug treatment and monitoring to assess drug responses. Methods of response evaluation have been developed using stringent criteria modeled after the clinical setting, in order to minimize the likelihood of over-predicting drug responses in mice leading to failure of drugs in the clinic. The proposed drug testing will adopt multiple formats, including conventional drug testing (6- 10 mice/group), single-mouse trial testing (1 PDX x 1 mouse x 1 drug) and testing of new agents in combination with standard-of-care drugs. In this fashion, this Research Program aims to test 8-10 new agents per year. By completing the major objectives outlined in this proposal, the long term health benefit aims to improve the treatment options and quality of life for children with aggressive forms of ALL who would otherwise succumb to their disease.",Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia;Adopted;Adult;Advisory Committees;Animals;Aspirate substance;B-Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia;Biopsy;Bone Marrow;Cancer Patient;Cells;Characteristics;Child;Childhood;Childhood Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia;Clinic;Clinical;Clinical Trials;Data;Diagnosis;Disease;Drug Combinations;Drug Kinetics;Drug Monitoring;Drug resistance;Engraftment;Ensure;Evaluation;Experimental Models;Exposure to;Failure;Foundations;Funding;Future;Gene Expression Profiling;Government;Health Benefit;Heterogeneity;Human;Immune;Industry Collaboration;Infant;Lesion;Leukemic Cell;Liver;Luciferases;MLL-rearranged leukemia;Malignant Childhood Neoplasm;Manuscripts;Measures;Methodology;Methods;Modeling;Molecular;Monitor;Mus;Mutation;New Agents;Organ;Outcome;Outcomes Research;PTPRC gene;Patients;Performance;Ph+ ALL;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacodynamics;Pharmacotherapy;Philadelphia Chromosome;Play;Preclinical Testing;Preparation;Publications;Quality Control;Quality of life;Relapse;Reproducibility;Research;Research Personnel;Resources;Role;SNP genotyping;Schedule;Spleen;Statutes and Laws;Systemic disease;T-Lymphocyte;Tail;Testing;Time;Toxic effect;Transplantation;United States National Institutes of Health;Variant;Veins;animal imaging;bioluminescence imaging;clinical development;cost estimate;design;drug response prediction;drug testing;early phase clinical trial;exome sequencing;experience;experimental study;flexibility;follow-up;high risk;improved;improved outcome;in vivo;in vivo evaluation;lentivirally transduced;leukemia;novel;novel therapeutics;patient derived xenograft model;peripheral blood;pre-clinical;programs;public-private partnership;response;standard of care;transcriptome sequencing;treatment response,UNIVERSITY OF NEW SOUTH WALES,SYDNEY,,AUSTRALIA,Richard B Lock,Malcolm M Smith,445877,445877,2022-08-11,2015-08-01,2026-06-30,RFA-CA-20-034,True duplicate in all columns.

Our lab's long- term mission is to identify novel molecular targets in osteosarcoma via comprehensive genomic and proteomic profiling of patient-derived cell lines and xenografts as well as human tumors with the ultimate goal of identifying and/or developing and testing therapeutics against these targets. To achieve this goal, we have a) built a robust profiling platform to identify novel targets; b) expanded our repertoire of osteosarcoma patient derived xenograft (PDX) models to reflect disease heterogeneity; and c) conducted high-throughput in vivo testing of 8-10 new agents each year both as part of Pediatric Preclinical Testing Consortium (PPTC) as well as independent of it. All of these efforts form the basis of our current research proposal and place us strongly poised to successfully achieve our goals. Our overall objective is to efficiently evaluate the efficacy of new agents with high potential to have activity in osteosarcoma based on target data from our genomic and proteomic profiling both as single agents and in rational combinations, with the vision of moving effective agents into clinical trials through the Children's Oncology Group. We have three specific aims- 1) to select and test agents in vivo against surface targets identified by comprehensive proteomic profiling of osteosarcoma xenografts and patient tumors; 2) to select and test agents in vivo against targets identified by comprehensive genomic profiling of osteosarcoma xenografts and patient tumors; and 3) to perform testing of rationally combined agents based on target, toxicity and efficacy data of single agents. Agents from the PPTC pipeline will be selected based on either the proteomic target or genomic alteration being present in at least a subset of available osteosarcoma PDX models. The agent will be tested in selected cohorts of low/ high expressing protein target or present/ absent genomic alteration. In cases with multiple models with target expression, 3-5 mice per model will be used and in cases with few models available, 8-10 mice per model will be used for control and experiment groups with an overall n per arm per experiment of approximately 30 mice. Standard PPTC procedures will be used for tumor implantation and treatment. Tumor dimensions will be measured twice a week and response quantified as per standard PPTC definitions of complete response, maintained complete response, partial response, stable disease and progressive disease. For combination studies, three potential types of combinations will be considered based on efficacy and toxicity data- a) two surface protein targeted agents such as two antibody-drug conjugates; 2) two molecularly targeted agents and 3) a surface protein targeted agent and a molecularly targeted agent. Our results will guide the development of the next generation of clinical trials in osteosarcoma.",Adolescence;Adolescent and Young Adult;Antibodies;Antibody-drug conjugates;Biological Markers;CCNE1 gene;CD276 gene;CDK4 gene;Cell Line;Child;Childhood;Clinical Trials;Complement;Cytotoxic Chemotherapy;DNA Sequence Alteration;Data;Development;Dimensions;Disease;Drug Combinations;Drug Screening;Ensure;Foundations;Future;Genomics;Goals;Heterogeneity;Human;In complete remission;Incidence;Laboratories;Lead;Malignant - descriptor;Malignant Bone Neoplasm;Measures;Membrane Proteins;Mission;Modeling;Modernization;Molecular;Molecular Profiling;Molecular Target;Mus;New Agents;Normal tissue morphology;Oncogenic;Pathway interactions;Patient-Focused Outcomes;Patients;Pediatric Oncology Group;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phase II Clinical Trials;Population;Pre-Clinical Model;Preclinical Testing;Procedures;Progressive Disease;Proteins;Proteomics;Research Proposals;Resources;Sampling;Stable Disease;Surface;Surface Antigens;Testing;Therapeutic;Toxic effect;Vision;Work;Xenograft procedure;arm;base;biomarker development;biomarker selection;chemotherapy;clinical development;clinical efficacy;clinical translation;clinically actionable;cohort;disease heterogeneity;effective therapy;efficacy evaluation;experience;experimental study;genomic profiles;implantation;improved;in vivo;in vivo evaluation;inhibitor;molecular marker;next generation;novel;novel strategies;osteosarcoma;partial response;patient derived xenograft model;patient population;pre-clinical;precision medicine;preservation;primary bone cancer;protein expression;response;screening;screening program;survival outcome;targeted agent;targeted treatment;therapeutic evaluation;treatment response;tumor;tumorigenesis;young adult,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,HOUSTON,TX,UNITED STATES,Richard G.

PEP-CTN clinical trials will incorporate correlative genomics, biology, pharmacology, and imaging studies to further the understanding of the disposition and action of new agents introduced into the treatment of children with cancer. Annually, the PEP-CTN will enroll approximately 120 children and adolescents with cancer onto clinical trials of novel anticancer agents at the 21 core premier pediatric oncology sites throughout the country. The network institutions are selected through a peer review process, and serve as a national and international model for new agent development in pediatric oncology. The PEP- CTN will leverage the database infrastructure and resources of the parent Children's Oncology Group while maintaining its own administrative and operational infrastructure to ensure rapid development, implementation, and reporting of specialized and complex early phase clinical trials. The PEP-CTN has expertise and resources for the conduct of translational biology, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacogenetic studies, and utilizes state-of-the-art informatics systems to facilitate the transfer of response and correlative imaging studies for central review and analyses. The PEP-CTN's primary specific aims are: 1) To safely and efficiently introduce novel anticancer agents into the pediatric setting through the conduct of early phase clinical trials; 2) To expeditiously obtain preliminary efficacy signals through use of phase 2 expansion cohorts and pilot studies in order to inform tumor specific trials that will be conducted across COG sites; 3) To perform genomic analyses, including single gene studies or gene panels, to identify appropriate patients for early phase studies of targeted agents; 4) To identify associations of tumor characteristics with response to new agents using genomic analyses such as whole exome sequencing and RNA sequencing; 5) To incorporate pharmacologic and biologic endpoints, including circulating tumor DNA, other translational laboratory studies, and imaging modalities, into early phase studies, in order to enhance our understanding of the new agents and their effect on tumors..

Its full potential has yet to be realized, due in part, to a lack of biomarkers predicting response to treatment. Multiple immune and genomic biomarkers of response based on analysis of pre-treatment specimens have been described but most are not very robust with significant overlap between responders and non-responders. Therefore, there is a critical unmet need to perform comprehensive characterization of candidate biomarkers in early phase IMT trials using standardized assays and novel methodologies. Recognizing the need for comprehensive immune monitoring for IMT clinical trials, in 2017 NCI developed the Cancer Immune Monitoring and Analysis Center (CIMAC) and Cancer Immunologic Data Commons (CIDC) Network, with the goal of identifying biomarkers of response, resistance, and adverse events to optimize immunotherapy approaches for patients with cancer. The MD Anderson Cancer Immune Monitoring and Analysis Center (MDA-CIMAC) is one of four CIMAC sites established five years ago that has been standardizing genomic, pathology and immunology assays and supporting profiling of tissue and blood specimens from patients treated in IMT trials. The MDA-CIMAC will be co-led by Drs. Ignacio Wistuba, renowned cancer surgical and molecular pathologist, Gheath Al-Atrash, well-known medical oncologist with expertise in stem cell transplantation and immunotherapy, and Cara Haymaker, cancer immunologist with expertise in immune biomarker analysis. They will be supported by a multidisciplinary team of world-class and highly collaborative experts on cancer and immunotherapy. The main goals of MDA-CIMAC are to: 1) provide a centralized and harmonized platform for sample collection, processing and quality assurance, and 2) use analytically-validated and standardized (Tiers 1 and 2) and highly innovative (Tier 3) assays to offer analyses for phenotypic, genomic, and functional characterization of responses of patients enrolled on IMT clinical trials. In Aim 1, we will utilize Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) following the developed CIMAC umbrella protocol to provide services for processing and distribution of annotated biospecimens from the NCI-sponsored early phase immunotherapy clinical trials and to link the specimens to relevant clinical, pathological, immune and molecular data within the CIMAC-CIDC Network. In Aim 2, we will perform routine and innovative pathological, immunological and molecular analyses using standardized and validated and highly innovative assays to aid the completion of NCI- sponsored early phase clinical trials and the development of novel predictive IMT biomarkers. In Aim 3, in conjunction with the CIDC team, we will provide biostatistics and computational services for data collection and analysis, and will perform, interpret and predict modeling of high dimensional ('omic') data. We envision that the MDA-CIMAC will be indispensable as we make meaningful progress in cancer immunotherapeutic approaches.",Adverse event;Affect;Basic Science;Bioinformatics;Biological Assay;Biological Markers;Biometry;Blood;Blood specimen;Cancer Center;Cancer Patient;Categories;Cells;Clinical;Clinical Sciences;Complex;Computer software;Data;Data Analyses;Data Collection;Data Commons;Databases;Development;Disease;Genomics;Goals;Human;Immune;Immune checkpoint inhibitor;Immune response;Immune system;Immunologic Markers;Immunologic Monitoring;Immunologics;Immunologist;Immunology;Immunotherapeutic agent;Immunotherapy;Infrastructure;Integration Host Factors;Knowledge;Lateral;Lead;Link;Liquid substance;Malignant Neoplasms;Medical Oncologist;Methodology;Molecular;Molecular Analysis;Molecular Profiling;Outcome;Pathologic;Pathologist;Pathology;Patients;Phase;Phenotype;Procedures;Process;Protocols documentation;Publishing;Quality Control;Reporting;Research;Research Personnel;Resistance;Resources;Sampling;Secure;Services;Site;Specimen;Standardization;Stem cell transplant;System;Technology;Therapeutic;Tissues;Validation;anti-cancer;biomarker development;biomarker identification;biomarker signature;cancer immunotherapeutics;cancer immunotherapy;cancer surgery;cancer type;candidate marker;clinically relevant;data integration;data management;data quality;design;early phase clinical trial;experimental study;genomic biomarker;genomic data;genomic platform;high dimensionality;immune checkpoint;immunotherapy clinical trials;immunotherapy trials;improved;inhibitor;innovation;multidisciplinary;next generation;novel;participant enrollment;patient response;predictive marker;predictive modeling;prospective;quality assurance;responders and non-responders;response;response biomarker;sample collection;standard of care;translational potential;treatment optimization;treatment response;treatment strategy;tumor;tumor immunology;tumor microenvironment;web services,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,HOUSTON,TX,UNITED STATES,Gheath Al-Atrash;Cara L Haymaker;Ignacio I.

We will participate in working group calls, network meetings, and coordination with clinical teams. The Stanford CIMAC performs highly comprehensive assays of immune phenotype and function for NCI-identified clinical trials. These will include already validated and harmonized Tier 1 assays, validated Tier 2 assays, and newly proposed exploratory Tier 3 assays. For Tier 1 assays, we propose CyTOF, singleplex IHC, Olink, TCRseq and RNAseq. For Tier 2, we propose single-cell TCRseq, MIBI, ATACseq, and CyTOF proteomics. For Tier 3, we propose single-cell glycan imaging (by MALDI-ToF), spatial transcriptomics (Nanostring DSP platform), and single-cell genomics/proteomics (Mission Bio Tapestri and BD Rhapsody platforms). We will use longitudinal reference materials for tracking inter-batch and inter-project consistency. We will assess quality control measures on all assays before uploading data to the Cancer Immune Data Commons (CIDC) according to their specifications. We will also perform biostatistical analysis of results for all assays performed, in relation to clinical outcome data. For those trials where Stanford is the lead CIMAC, we will perform integrative analysis across assays, using appropriate machine learning techniques and multivariate regression algorithms such as LASSO or Elastic Net. We will work closely with the clinical teams to obtain standardized clinical data, and to disseminate and publish results in accordance with NCI guidelines.","ATAC-seq;Biological Assay;Biological Markers;Biometry;Cancer Center;Cancer Control;Cells;Clinical;Clinical Data;Clinical Trials;Collaborations;Correlative Study;Data;Data Commons;Databases;Elasticity;Ensure;Genomics;Grant;Guidelines;Image;Immune;Immunologic Monitoring;Immunology procedure;Immunotherapy;Lead;Machine Learning;Malignant Neoplasms;Measures;Mining;Mission;Outcome;Phenotype;Polysaccharides;Proteomics;Publishing;Quality Control;Regimen;Research;Sampling;Specific qualifier value;Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization;Standardization;T cell receptor repertoire sequencing;Techniques;Technology;Testing;Work;cancer clinical trial;data submission;innovation;meetings;nano-string;novel;predictive marker;regression algorithm;transcriptome sequencing;transcriptomics;treatment response;working group",STANFORD UNIVERSITY,STANFORD,CA,UNITED STATES,Sean Curtis Bendall;Holden T.

Most clinical trials of novel combinations either fail to include any support for complex correlative biomarker discovery, often due to costs of specimen collection and assays, or are performed in an idiosyncratic manner, making non- standardized data difficult to integrate as part of a larger repository. There is a need to go beyond just PD-L1 tissue expression and tumor mutation burden as FDA-approved yet imperfect predictors of immune checkpoint blockade, by generating high-dimensional datasets that characterize the tumor immune microenvironment, systemic circulating immune and proteomic markers from blood, and host-level immune fitness information (microbiome). The Cancer Immune Monitoring and Analysis Centers, Cancer Immunologic Data Commons, and Partnership for Accelerating Cancer Therapies (CIMAC-CIDC-PACT) is a Cancer Moonshot-funded network that brings together laboratory, clinical, and computational scientists, administrators, and regulatory specialists from four institutions, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (ISMMS), MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC), Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI), and Stanford University. Our unprecedented, coordinated effort to conduct IO clinical trial correlative studies and define new candidate biomarkers to improve immunotherapy had resulted in 37 clinical trials selected in the first funding period, with ongoing datasets resulted for 17 of them. This was achieved using rigorously assessed SOPs and processes from trial selection to data sharing. We propose to continue and expand these efforts as follows: A set of well-established, harmonized, high-dimensional tumor and blood-based assays will be applied to all newly selected trials, with the aim of evaluating and validating novel biomarker of treatment, clinical response, and/or adverse events (Aim 1). To spur innovation and increase granularity of our understanding of mechanism of action, high-tech yet validated single cell and spatial transcriptomic technologies as well as other omics will be proposed in exceptional patients for unbiased phenotyping, tissue composition, architectural organization, and immune profiling (Aim 2). The resulting unified data repository will be mined to define multi-omic and cross-trial markers, through biostatistical and computational innovative design to integrate datasets from various assays into higher analytical archetypes across studies (Aim 3). Together, our network is at the forefront of immune monitoring standards, by balancing innovation with reproducibility, to comprehensively assess biomarkers and strive for precision cancer treatment. We are poised to create an unparalleled resource of harmonized, clinically annotated datasets shared with the public that will establish best practice guidelines with the research community. Through rigorous implementation of state-of-the-art, cross-compared platforms, the CIMAC-CIDC initiative aims to accelerate identification of clinically actionable biomarkers of response, resistance, and adverse events, and define mechanisms at play.",16S ribosomal RNA sequencing;Acceleration;Achievement;Administrator;Adverse event;Agreement;Antigens;Architecture;Biological Assay;Biological Markers;Biometry;Blood;Cancer Center;Cell Therapy;Cells;Characteristics;Clinical;Clinical Trials;Collaborations;Communities;Complex;Correlative Study;Dana-Farber Cancer Institute;Data;Data Commons;Data Scientist;Data Set;Dedications;Ensure;FDA approved;Fruit;Funding;Genetic;Goals;Heart;Hematologic Neoplasms;Human;Human Resources;Immune;Immunologic Monitoring;Immunologics;Immunologist;Immunooncology;Immunotherapy;Institution;Joints;Knowledge;Laboratories;Leadership;Malignant Neoplasms;Manuscripts;Methodology;Mission;Modality;Modeling;Molecular;Molecular Profiling;Mutation;Outcome;Output;Pathologist;Pathology;Pathway interactions;Patients;Phenotype;Play;Postdoctoral Fellow;Practice Guidelines;Procedures;Process;Prognostic Marker;Proteomics;Protocols documentation;Recommendation;Reproducibility;Research;Resistance;Resources;Sampling;Scientist;Serum;Solid Neoplasm;Specialist;Specimen;Standardization;T cell receptor repertoire sequencing;Technology;Thinking;Time;Tissues;Tumor Tissue;Universities;Viral;Work;biomarker discovery;cancer clinical trial;cancer immunotherapy;cancer therapy;candidate marker;clinically actionable;complex data;cost;data integration;data repository;data sharing;demographics;design;early phase clinical trial;empowerment;exceptional responders;expectation;fitness;high dimensionality;immune checkpoint;immune checkpoint blockade;immunotherapy clinical trials;immunotherapy trials;improved;innovation;interest;machine learning method;medical schools;microbiome;multidimensional data;multiple omics;new therapeutic target;next generation;novel;novel marker;pharmacodynamic biomarker;predictive marker;programmed cell death ligand 1;programs;repository;response;response biomarker;sample collection;technology platform;transcriptome sequencing;transcriptomics;tumor;tumor-immune system interactions,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,NEW YORK,NY,UNITED STATES,Sacha Gnjatic;Seunghee Kim-Schulze,Min-Kyung H Song,1983570,1983570,2023-07-21,2017-09-30,2028-06-30,RFA-CA-22-038,True duplicate in all columns.

grant,2U24CA224331-02,U24CA224331,10730296,2023,Cancer Immune Monitoring and Analysis Center,"Summary Because cancer immunotherapy constitutes one of the most transformative therapeutic movements over the history of cancer treatment, there are now hundreds, if not thousands, of ongoing clinical trials in this field. Despite the remarkable success for a subset of patients, there are substantial gaps in our knowledge. No more than 30% of patients respond to immune checkpoint blockade and related therapies, many responding patients develop therapeutic resistance, and many responding and non-responding patients suffer from immune-related toxicities. There is a clear need to identify critical biomarkers of response, resistance, and toxicity. To improve our ability to meet this challenge, the NCI-sponsored Cancer Immune Monitoring and Analysis Center (CIMAC) program was created to enable consistent and comparable interrogation of patient biospecimens across multiple clinical trials. The program has successfully established a common set of assays harmonized across the four CIMACs, augmented this basic set with more specialized tests that may be CIMAC-specific but are still accessible across institutions, deployed these tools across dozens of phase I/II immunotherapy trials, and generated a pool of standardized data to facilitate inter-trial comparisons. The CIMAC created at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) built on the existing Center of Immuno-Oncology (CIO) and the long-standing collaboration with the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. The DFCI/Broad CIMAC, joining with the other CIMACS, now proposes to continue the network mission to compare tumor and immune response features of individual cancer types treated by multiple immunotherapeutic modalities and multiple cancer types treated by a single immunotherapeutic modality in order to dissect common and individualized mechanisms of action. One driving motivation for this renewal application is that the power to identify biomarkers increases with the number of clinical trials analyzed. Thus, Aim 1 focuses on deploying the suite of assays established over the past five years to biospecimens collected from additional innovative immunotherapy clinical trials to standardize biomarker analysis and interpretation. To broaden the scope of parameters being examined, Aim 2 proposes to develop and verify performance for novel and more complex assays to expand the network capabilities and advance discovery. Of particular value will be methods that improve multiomic single cell profiling, multiomic spatial analysis, and immunopeptidome characterization. Aim 3 addresses the challenge of integrating multiomic data across an increasing number of clinical trials by building novel computational tools that can efficiently process massive amounts of data and generate interpretable representations of the results.

grant,2U24CA224285-02,U24CA224285,10729960,2023,MD Anderson Cancer Immune Monitoring and Analysis Center MDA-CIMAC,"ABSTRACT Immunotherapy (IMT) has emerged as a promising treatment strategy across a broad spectrum of human cancers, with multiple agents, particularly immune check point inhibitors, showing promising results in various types of cancers. Its full potential has yet to be realized, due in part, to a lack of biomarkers predicting response to treatment. Multiple immune and genomic biomarkers of response based on analysis of pre-treatment specimens have been described but most are not very robust with significant overlap between responders and non-responders. Therefore, there is a critical unmet need to perform comprehensive characterization of candidate biomarkers in early phase IMT trials using standardized assays and novel methodologies. Recognizing the need for comprehensive immune monitoring for IMT clinical trials, in 2017 NCI developed the Cancer Immune Monitoring and Analysis Center (CIMAC) and Cancer Immunologic Data Commons (CIDC) Network, with the goal of identifying biomarkers of response, resistance, and adverse events to optimize immunotherapy approaches for patients with cancer. The MD Anderson Cancer Immune Monitoring and Analysis Center (MDA-CIMAC) is one of four CIMAC sites established five years ago that has been standardizing genomic, pathology and immunology assays and supporting profiling of tissue and blood specimens from patients treated in IMT trials. The MDA-CIMAC will be co-led by Drs. Ignacio Wistuba, renowned cancer surgical and molecular pathologist, Gheath Al-Atrash, well-known medical oncologist with expertise in stem cell transplantation and immunotherapy, and Cara Haymaker, cancer immunologist with expertise in immune biomarker analysis. They will be supported by a multidisciplinary team of world-class and highly collaborative experts on cancer and immunotherapy. The main goals of MDA-CIMAC are to: 1) provide a centralized and harmonized platform for sample collection, processing and quality assurance, and 2) use analytically-validated and standardized (Tiers 1 and 2) and highly innovative (Tier 3) assays to offer analyses for phenotypic, genomic, and functional characterization of responses of patients enrolled on IMT clinical trials. In Aim 1, we will utilize Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) following the developed CIMAC umbrella protocol to provide services for processing and distribution of annotated biospecimens from the NCI-sponsored early phase immunotherapy clinical trials and to link the specimens to relevant clinical, pathological, immune and molecular data within the CIMAC-CIDC Network. In Aim 2, we will perform routine and innovative pathological, immunological and molecular analyses using standardized and validated and highly innovative assays to aid the completion of NCI- sponsored early phase clinical trials and the development of novel predictive IMT biomarkers. In Aim 3, in conjunction with the CIDC team, we will provide biostatistics and computational services for data collection and analysis, and will perform, interpret and predict modeling of high dimensional ('omic') data. We envision that the MDA-CIMAC will be indispensable as we make meaningful progress in cancer immunotherapeutic approaches.",Adverse event;Affect;Basic Science;Bioinformatics;Biological Assay;Biological Markers;Biometry;Blood;Blood specimen;Cancer Center;Cancer Patient;Categories;Cells;Clinical;Clinical Sciences;Complex;Computer software;Data;Data Analyses;Data Collection;Data Commons;Databases;Development;Disease;Genomics;Goals;Human;Immune;Immune checkpoint inhibitor;Immune response;Immune system;Immunologic Markers;Immunologic Monitoring;Immunologics;Immunologist;Immunology;Immunotherapeutic agent;Immunotherapy;Infrastructure;Integration Host Factors;Knowledge;Lateral;Lead;Link;Liquid substance;Malignant Neoplasms;Medical Oncologist;Methodology;Molecular;Molecular Analysis;Molecular Profiling;Outcome;Pathologic;Pathologist;Pathology;Patients;Phase;Phenotype;Procedures;Process;Protocols documentation;Publishing;Quality Control;Reporting;Research;Research Personnel;Resistance;Resources;Sampling;Secure;Services;Site;Specimen;Standardization;Stem cell transplant;System;Technology;Therapeutic;Tissues;Validation;anti-cancer;biomarker development;biomarker identification;biomarker signature;cancer immunotherapeutics;cancer immunotherapy;cancer surgery;cancer type;candidate marker;clinically relevant;data integration;data management;data quality;design;early phase clinical trial;experimental study;genomic biomarker;genomic data;genomic platform;high dimensionality;immune checkpoint;immunotherapy clinical trials;immunotherapy trials;improved;inhibitor;innovation;multidisciplinary;next generation;novel;participant enrollment;patient response;predictive marker;predictive modeling;prospective;quality assurance;responders and non-responders;response;response biomarker;sample collection;standard of care;translational potential;treatment optimization;treatment response;treatment strategy;tumor;tumor immunology;tumor microenvironment;web services,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,HOUSTON,TX,UNITED STATES,Gheath Al-Atrash;Cara L Haymaker;Ignacio I.

We will participate in working group calls, network meetings, and coordination with clinical teams. The Stanford CIMAC performs highly comprehensive assays of immune phenotype and function for NCI-identified clinical trials. These will include already validated and harmonized Tier 1 assays, validated Tier 2 assays, and newly proposed exploratory Tier 3 assays. For Tier 1 assays, we propose CyTOF, singleplex IHC, Olink, TCRseq and RNAseq. For Tier 2, we propose single-cell TCRseq, MIBI, ATACseq, and CyTOF proteomics. For Tier 3, we propose single-cell glycan imaging (by MALDI-ToF), spatial transcriptomics (Nanostring DSP platform), and single-cell genomics/proteomics (Mission Bio Tapestri and BD Rhapsody platforms). We will use longitudinal reference materials for tracking inter-batch and inter-project consistency. We will assess quality control measures on all assays before uploading data to the Cancer Immune Data Commons (CIDC) according to their specifications. We will also perform biostatistical analysis of results for all assays performed, in relation to clinical outcome data. For those trials where Stanford is the lead CIMAC, we will perform integrative analysis across assays, using appropriate machine learning techniques and multivariate regression algorithms such as LASSO or Elastic Net. We will work closely with the clinical teams to obtain standardized clinical data, and to disseminate and publish results in accordance with NCI guidelines.","ATAC-seq;Biological Assay;Biological Markers;Biometry;Cancer Center;Cancer Control;Cells;Clinical;Clinical Data;Clinical Trials;Collaborations;Correlative Study;Data;Data Commons;Databases;Elasticity;Ensure;Genomics;Grant;Guidelines;Image;Immune;Immunologic Monitoring;Immunology procedure;Immunotherapy;Lead;Machine Learning;Malignant Neoplasms;Measures;Mining;Mission;Outcome;Phenotype;Polysaccharides;Proteomics;Publishing;Quality Control;Regimen;Research;Sampling;Specific qualifier value;Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization;Standardization;T cell receptor repertoire sequencing;Techniques;Technology;Testing;Work;cancer clinical trial;data submission;innovation;meetings;nano-string;novel;predictive marker;regression algorithm;transcriptome sequencing;transcriptomics;treatment response;working group",STANFORD UNIVERSITY,STANFORD,CA,UNITED STATES,Sean Curtis Bendall;Holden T.

Most clinical trials of novel combinations either fail to include any support for complex correlative biomarker discovery, often due to costs of specimen collection and assays, or are performed in an idiosyncratic manner, making non- standardized data difficult to integrate as part of a larger repository. There is a need to go beyond just PD-L1 tissue expression and tumor mutation burden as FDA-approved yet imperfect predictors of immune checkpoint blockade, by generating high-dimensional datasets that characterize the tumor immune microenvironment, systemic circulating immune and proteomic markers from blood, and host-level immune fitness information (microbiome). The Cancer Immune Monitoring and Analysis Centers, Cancer Immunologic Data Commons, and Partnership for Accelerating Cancer Therapies (CIMAC-CIDC-PACT) is a Cancer Moonshot-funded network that brings together laboratory, clinical, and computational scientists, administrators, and regulatory specialists from four institutions, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (ISMMS), MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC), Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI), and Stanford University. Our unprecedented, coordinated effort to conduct IO clinical trial correlative studies and define new candidate biomarkers to improve immunotherapy had resulted in 37 clinical trials selected in the first funding period, with ongoing datasets resulted for 17 of them. This was achieved using rigorously assessed SOPs and processes from trial selection to data sharing. We propose to continue and expand these efforts as follows: A set of well-established, harmonized, high-dimensional tumor and blood-based assays will be applied to all newly selected trials, with the aim of evaluating and validating novel biomarker of treatment, clinical response, and/or adverse events (Aim 1). To spur innovation and increase granularity of our understanding of mechanism of action, high-tech yet validated single cell and spatial transcriptomic technologies as well as other omics will be proposed in exceptional patients for unbiased phenotyping, tissue composition, architectural organization, and immune profiling (Aim 2). The resulting unified data repository will be mined to define multi-omic and cross-trial markers, through biostatistical and computational innovative design to integrate datasets from various assays into higher analytical archetypes across studies (Aim 3). Together, our network is at the forefront of immune monitoring standards, by balancing innovation with reproducibility, to comprehensively assess biomarkers and strive for precision cancer treatment. We are poised to create an unparalleled resource of harmonized, clinically annotated datasets shared with the public that will establish best practice guidelines with the research community. Through rigorous implementation of state-of-the-art, cross-compared platforms, the CIMAC-CIDC initiative aims to accelerate identification of clinically actionable biomarkers of response, resistance, and adverse events, and define mechanisms at play.",16S ribosomal RNA sequencing;Acceleration;Achievement;Administrator;Adverse event;Agreement;Antigens;Architecture;Biological Assay;Biological Markers;Biometry;Blood;Cancer Center;Cell Therapy;Cells;Characteristics;Clinical;Clinical Trials;Collaborations;Communities;Complex;Correlative Study;Dana-Farber Cancer Institute;Data;Data Commons;Data Scientist;Data Set;Dedications;Ensure;FDA approved;Fruit;Funding;Genetic;Goals;Heart;Hematologic Neoplasms;Human;Human Resources;Immune;Immunologic Monitoring;Immunologics;Immunologist;Immunooncology;Immunotherapy;Institution;Joints;Knowledge;Laboratories;Leadership;Malignant Neoplasms;Manuscripts;Methodology;Mission;Modality;Modeling;Molecular;Molecular Profiling;Mutation;Outcome;Output;Pathologist;Pathology;Pathway interactions;Patients;Phenotype;Play;Postdoctoral Fellow;Practice Guidelines;Procedures;Process;Prognostic Marker;Proteomics;Protocols documentation;Recommendation;Reproducibility;Research;Resistance;Resources;Sampling;Scientist;Serum;Solid Neoplasm;Specialist;Specimen;Standardization;T cell receptor repertoire sequencing;Technology;Thinking;Time;Tissues;Tumor Tissue;Universities;Viral;Work;biomarker discovery;cancer clinical trial;cancer immunotherapy;cancer therapy;candidate marker;clinically actionable;complex data;cost;data integration;data repository;data sharing;demographics;design;early phase clinical trial;empowerment;exceptional responders;expectation;fitness;high dimensionality;immune checkpoint;immune checkpoint blockade;immunotherapy clinical trials;immunotherapy trials;improved;innovation;interest;machine learning method;medical schools;microbiome;multidimensional data;multiple omics;new therapeutic target;next generation;novel;novel marker;pharmacodynamic biomarker;predictive marker;programmed cell death ligand 1;programs;repository;response;response biomarker;sample collection;technology platform;transcriptome sequencing;transcriptomics;tumor;tumor-immune system interactions,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,NEW YORK,NY,UNITED STATES,Sacha Gnjatic;Seunghee Kim-Schulze,Min-Kyung H Song,1983570,1983570,2023-07-21,2017-09-30,2028-06-30,RFA-CA-22-038,True duplicate in all columns.

grant,2U24CA224331-02,U24CA224331,10730296,2023,Cancer Immune Monitoring and Analysis Center,"Summary Because cancer immunotherapy constitutes one of the most transformative therapeutic movements over the history of cancer treatment, there are now hundreds, if not thousands, of ongoing clinical trials in this field. Despite the remarkable success for a subset of patients, there are substantial gaps in our knowledge. No more than 30% of patients respond to immune checkpoint blockade and related therapies, many responding patients develop therapeutic resistance, and many responding and non-responding patients suffer from immune-related toxicities. There is a clear need to identify critical biomarkers of response, resistance, and toxicity. To improve our ability to meet this challenge, the NCI-sponsored Cancer Immune Monitoring and Analysis Center (CIMAC) program was created to enable consistent and comparable interrogation of patient biospecimens across multiple clinical trials. The program has successfully established a common set of assays harmonized across the four CIMACs, augmented this basic set with more specialized tests that may be CIMAC-specific but are still accessible across institutions, deployed these tools across dozens of phase I/II immunotherapy trials, and generated a pool of standardized data to facilitate inter-trial comparisons. The CIMAC created at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) built on the existing Center of Immuno-Oncology (CIO) and the long-standing collaboration with the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. The DFCI/Broad CIMAC, joining with the other CIMACS, now proposes to continue the network mission to compare tumor and immune response features of individual cancer types treated by multiple immunotherapeutic modalities and multiple cancer types treated by a single immunotherapeutic modality in order to dissect common and individualized mechanisms of action.

Precision medicine holds great promise for these kids, but matching children to available clinical trials remains a challenge due a lack of up-to-date information and highly complex eligibility criteria based on clinical information and genomic and immunophenotype biomarker data. In collaboration with The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, the Pediatric Cancer Data Commons (PCDC) team has developed GEARBOx (Genomic Eligibility Algorithm at Relapse for Better Outcomes), a clinical trial matching tool to allow clinicians to quickly find potential matches for their patients with relapsed or refractory acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). We now endeavor to expand GEARBOx to include several more tumor types, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia, neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, and osteosarcoma. Additionally, we will augment the often-manual abstraction of eligibility criteria from clinical trials with new automated methods. The information available to clinicians about trials will be supplemented to include critical data for how to quickly and efficiently enroll a child on a matched study. Finally, the PCDC team will partner with a third-party flow cytometry lab (Hematologics) to create ways to automatically pull and incorporate structured immunophenotype data directly into the GEARBOx tool. These enhancements will greatly enhance the process of finding appropriate clinical trials for patients and then getting them enrolled, thus improving access to critical precision therapy for these children.",3-Dimensional;Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia;Acute Myelocytic Leukemia;Agreement;Algorithms;Biological Markers;Cancer Relapse;Caring;Characteristics;Chicago;Child;Clinical;Clinical Data;Clinical Trials;Collaborations;Community Clinical Oncology Program;Complex;Data;Data Commons;Data Sources;Development;Disease;Eligibility Determination;Enrollment;Ewings sarcoma;Exclusion Criteria;Feedback;Flow Cytometry;Genomics;Hematology;Immunophenotyping;Improve Access;International;Logic;Malignant Childhood Neoplasm;Malignant Neoplasms;Manuals;Measures;Methods;Monitor;Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial;Multiomic Data;Natural Language Processing;Neuroblastoma;Outcome;Patients;Pediatric Oncologist;Pediatric Oncology;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacologic Substance;Precision therapeutics;Process;Protocols documentation;Rare Diseases;Recurrent disease;Refractory;Refractory Disease;Relapse;Research Personnel;Resources;Rhabdomyosarcoma;Site;Societies;Solid Neoplasm;Source;Structure;Supervision;System;Testing;Time;Universities;Visualization;Work;base;chemotherapy;cooperative study;data sharing;improved;improved outcome;leukemia/lymphoma;novel therapeutics;osteosarcoma;precision medicine;refractory cancer;success;targeted therapy trials;tool;tumor;unsupervised learning;usability,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,CHICAGO,IL,UNITED STATES,Samuel Volchenboum,Anita H.

Relatively few driver mutations actually alter the function of proteins in tumor cells, whereas most mutations are considered to be functionally neutral passenger mutations. Over the past decade, the search for cancer driver mutations has focused on coding regions and several mutational significance algorithms have been developed for coding mutations. The contribution of mutations in noncoding regulatory regions to tumor formation largely remains unknown and current mutational significance algorithms are not designed to detect driver mutations in noncoding regions, due to biological differences between coding and noncoding mutations. The emerging availability of large whole- genome sequencing datasets (e.g. PCAWG and HMF datasets) creates an ample opportunity to develop new mutational significance algorithms that are particularly designed for the interpretation of noncoding regions. Recently, we have developed a new statistical approach that identifies driver mutations in coding regions based on the nucleotide context. Critically, consideration of the nucleotide context around mutations does not require prior knowledge for functional consequences associated with these mutations. Hence, we hypothesize that generalizing our nucleotide context model to noncoding regions will uncover novel noncoding driver mutations that cannot be detected using the mutational significance approaches currently available. For this purpose, we will develop a statistical framework that incorporates the biological differences between coding and noncoding mutations and that is specifically designed to detect driver mutations in noncoding regions. Specifically, we will consider the context-dependent distribution of passenger mutations, modeling of the background mutation rate, accurately partition the background mutation rate, model the sequence composition of the reference genome, and account for coverage fluctuation. We will then combine these statistical components by computing an independent product of their underlying probabilities. We will derive a significance p-value using a Monte-Carlo simulation approach, and use FDR for multiple hypothesis test correction. This strategy will allow us to accurately estimate the significance of somatic mutations in noncoding genomic regions. We will next apply this statistical framework to whole-genome sequencing data of 5,523 tumor patients, thereby deriving a comprehensive list of candidate driver mutations in noncoding regions. Finally, we will investigate whether noncoding mutations are overrepresented in transcription factor binding sites, regulate gene expression levels, induce alternative splicing, or affect epigenomic states. Upon the completion of this project, we will have developed and applied a statistical framework for discovery of significant somatic mutations in noncoding regions, and defined the mutational landscape of the non-coding cancer genome.

One possible reason for this is the unique biology of the pancreatic cancer in establishing an immune suppressive microenvironment. We find that cross communication between cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs), tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) and tumor cells is critical. Using animal models of PDA, we find that tumor cells polarize macrophages to TAMs both by activating CAFs to produce IL6 and by producing specific metabolites. TAMs then both suppress the immune response by arginine depletion by making Arginase 1 and by producing EGFR ligands, primarily HBEGF, to stimulate pancreatic cancer cells to express PDL1, an immune checkpoint ligand. We propose to use a combination of matched humanized patient derived xenografts (PDXs), organoid culture systems made up of cancer cells, immune cells and CAFs (ie 'microtumors') and a unique dual recombinase genetically engineered mouse model of PDA to test the hypothesis that treatment of tumors with inhibitors of STAT3, HBEGF, ARG1 or MEK will effectively synergize with PD1 inhibition, overcoming the powerful immune suppression created by the pancreatic cancer microenvironment.",Ablation;Adenocarcinoma Cell;Affect;Animal Model;Antigen-Antibody Complex;Arginine;Biocompatible Materials;Biological Models;Biology;CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes;Cancer Patient;Cell Communication;Cells;Communication;Complex;DTR gene;Engineering;Environment;Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor;Epithelial;Feedback;Fibroblasts;Genetically Engineered Mouse;Goals;Growth Factor;Human;IL6 gene;Immune;Immune checkpoint inhibitor;Immune response;Immune system;Immunosuppression;Immunosuppressive Agents;Immunotherapeutic agent;Immunotherapy;In Vitro;Infiltration;Inflammatory;Interruption;Lead;Ligands;MAP Kinase Gene;MEK inhibition;Malignant Neoplasms;Malignant neoplasm of pancreas;Mediating;Methods;Michigan;Modality;Myelogenous;Myeloid Cells;Neoplasm Metastasis;Neoplasm Transplantation;Organoids;PDCD1LG1 gene;Pancreas;Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma;Patients;Phenotype;Pre-Clinical Model;Process;Research;Research Personnel;Research Proposals;Role;STAT3 gene;Schools;Scientist;Series;Signal Transduction;Suppressor-Effector T-Lymphocytes;System;T-Lymphocyte;Testing;Therapeutic;Transplantation;Universities;Work;Xenograft procedure;arginase;base;cancer cell;cancer therapy;cell growth;checkpoint therapy;combat;cytokine;experience;fighting;immune checkpoint;in vivo;inhibitor/antagonist;innovation;intercellular communication;macrophage;medical schools;mouse model;neoplastic cell;novel;pancreatic cancer cells;pancreatic neoplasm;polarized cell;recombinase;response;scaffold;tumor;tumor growth;tumor microenvironment,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,ANN ARBOR,MI,UNITED STATES,Howard C Crawford;Marina Pasca Di Magliano,Jeffrey Hildesheim,1497616,1497616,2017-09-25,2017-09-30,2020-08-31,RFA-CA-17-015,True duplicate in all columns.

Despite success in other cancer types, immunotherapy approaches in PDAC have not shown efficacy. PDAC demonstrates a heterogeneous and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) that is poorly understood and serves as a barrier to effective immunotherapy strategies in this disease. We propose that an improved understanding of the TME and novel approaches that target key tumor-stroma interactions will enable remodeling of the immunosuppressive TME to enhance the efficacy of current and future immunotherapy strategies. In particular, we believe that successful combination immunotherapy approaches in PDAC will include strategies that alter myeloid cells to relieve immunosuppression, cytotoxic therapies that target tumor cells to improve immune response, and agents that augment anti-tumor T cell activity. In this project, we will perform a comprehensive characterization of the PDAC TME in both primary and metastatic PDAC in the baseline untreated context as well as across multiple different clinical therapies. In Aim 1, we will utilize single-cell transcriptomic and proteomic technologies to provide a cellular atlas of the PDAC TME at unprecedented resolution. In Aim 2, we will examine how the PDAC TME changes with chemotherapy, radiation therapy and a novel CCR2 inhibitor that modulates macrophage recruitment in the TME. For these studies, we will utilize human samples derived from both resectable and metastatic patients on clinical trials at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.

Neoantigen load predicts immunotherapeutic response, validating antigen identification as a rational strategy of biomarker discovery. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) however has shown limited efficacy to checkpoint blockade immunotherapy due to presumed neoantigen paucity. However, systematic antigen discovery in PDAC is lacking. 3% of PDAC patients survive > 5 years (long term survivors). As T cell immunity may explain this extreme outcome, they represent the ideal cohort for deep antigen discovery. Using genomic, molecular, and cellular immunoprofiling, computational evolutionary modeling, and neoantigen discovery in these rare long term survivors (n=82), we have discovered that neoantigen quality, but not quantity, is prognostic of survival, and that long term survivors evidence lasting neoantigen-specific T cell immunity. The scientific objectives of this proposal are to address questions essential to translate these findings - 1) is there stage and treatment- specific neoantigen heterogeneity, 2) can neoantigens be identified in the peripheral blood, and 3) can neoantigen quality predict response to immunotherapy. The translational objective is to develop novel tissue and blood-based biomarkers for rational patient and target selection for immunotherapy. The proposal utilizes several highly unique tissue collection strategies - a) laparoscopic multi-site biopsies to identify stage-specific heterogeneity, b) serial pre- and post-chemotherapy assessment for treatment-specific modulation, and c) evaluation of neoantigen quality as a predictive biomarker on a large, immunotherapeutic PDAC trial.

Recent progress has identified essential barriers in this complex microenvironment that impede drug delivery and suppress immunity. These processes include the prohibitive interstitial pressures generated by high concentrations of hyaluronan (HA) complexed with water, dense fibrosis associated with fibrillar collagen deposition, and multiple classes of immunosuppressive and pro-tumorigenic cells such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells and macrophages. The team assembled in this project has made many of the seminal discoveries described above. In addition, we have developed several highly novel and powerful experimental platforms to rigorously interrogate the complex mechanisms and interactions among various compartments in the tumor microenvironment that collectively conspire to promote the survival of pancreas cancers and metastases and thwart treatment. Our overarching hypothesis is that significantly improving survival for PDA patients will require targeting not only the tumor epithelial cell, but also the three compartments that support its oncogenesis: hematopoietic, mesenchymal and extracellular matrix. In the following, we propose to investigate the combination of cytotoxic therapy with stromal disruption and myeloid cell modulations to maximize engagement of anti-tumor immunity and treatment efficacy. We will pursue these investigations in four distinct experimental platforms that offer complementary strengths and mitigate limitations: 1) genetically engineered mouse models (GEMM) of autochthonous PDA; 2) syngeneic allografts; 3) patient-derived xenograft (PDX) systems; and 4) patient-derived organoids (PDO).",Allografting;Alpha Cell;Architecture;Autologous;Behavior;Biological Models;Biology;Blood Vessels;Cancer Etiology;Cell Therapy;Cells;Cessation of life;Characteristics;Clinic;Coculture Techniques;Collagen;Complement;Complex;Cytotoxic Chemotherapy;Deposition;Disease;Disease Progression;Drug Delivery Systems;Education;Elements;Epithelial Cells;Evolution;Experimental Models;Extracellular Matrix;Extracellular Matrix Proteins;Fibrillar Collagen;Fibroblasts;Fibrosis;Friends;Functional disorder;Gel;Genetically Engineered Mouse;Glycosaminoglycans;Hematopoietic;Human;Hyaluronan;Immune;Immune response;Immunity;Immunosuppression;Immunosuppressive Agents;Investigation;Liquid substance;Malignant neoplasm of pancreas;Mechanics;Mesenchymal;Minority;Modeling;Mus;Myelogenous;Myeloid Cells;Myofibroblast;Neoplasm Metastasis;Normal tissue morphology;Organ;Organoids;Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma;Pathogenesis;Patients;Perfusion;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phase;Physiologic pulse;Physiology;Population;Process;Proteoglycan;Regimen;Research Personnel;Seminal;Series;Signal Transduction;Suppressor-Effector T-Lymphocytes;Surface;System;T-Lymphocyte;Toxic effect;Treatment Efficacy;Treatment Protocols;Tumor Immunity;Tumorigenicity;Water;Xenograft procedure;cell type;combinatorial;cytotoxic;hypoperfusion;improved;insight;interstitial;macrophage;monocyte;mouse model;next generation;novel;novel therapeutics;pressure;receptor;reconstitution;response;standard of care;therapy resistant;treatment strategy;tumor;tumor growth;tumor microenvironment;tumorigenesis;tumorigenic,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,SEATTLE,WA,UNITED STATES,Sunil R Hingorani,Jeffrey Hildesheim,1846829,1846829,2017-09-25,2017-09-30,2020-08-31,RFA-CA-17-015,True duplicate in all columns.

The mechanisms underlying this benefit include 'normalization' of cancer-associated fibroblasts and extracellular matrix (ECM), resulting in blood vessel decompression, improved perfusion, and decreased hypoxia. These exciting preclinical findings formed the basis of an ongoing Phase II clinical trial at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), which combines losartan with cytotoxic therapy - FOLFIRINOX and then chemoradiotherapy in unresectable locally advanced PDAC (NCT01821729). An interim analysis of this trial indicates that adding losartan to neoadjuvant cytotoxic therapy doubles the frequency of conversion to resectable tumors (52%) and strikingly improves overall survival (OS) in these PDAC patients. Remarkably, transcriptomic analysis of tumor biopsies from PDAC patients further indicates that ASI treatment not only normalizes ECM-related phenotypes but also upregulates key pathways associated with anti-tumor immunity involving both adaptive (e.g., CD8+ T cells) and innate (e.g., dendritic cells (DCs)) immune components of the PDAC tumor microenvironment. Based on these preclinical and clinical findings, we hypothesize that ASIs in combination with cytotoxic agents will reprogram the heterogeneous, pro-fibrotic, and immunosuppressive PDAC tumor microenvironment to one that is immunostimulatory. We further propose that combining ASIs and cytotoxic agents will enhance the delivery and efficacy of immunotherapies, which until now have had limited or no benefit in PDAC patients. To test these hypotheses, we designed three Specific Aims: 1) Uncover how losartan combined with cytotoxic agents alters tumor microenvironmental components (ECM, blood vessels, hypoxia) and immune cells, in locally advanced PDAC patients; 2) Dissect the causal role of drug- induced adaptive and innate immune cells in the anti-tumor response in orthotopic (implanted and genetically engineered) PDAC models in mice; and 3) Evaluate whether combining ASI-induced tumor microenvironment reprogramming along with cytotoxic therapies enhances the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockers. Based on our preclinical and clinical data, our tightly integrated and multidisciplinary team of investigators, and our bench-to-bedside-and-back research approach, we anticipate that successful completion of these studies will positively impact the development of new treatments for locally advanced PDAC patients who currently have a 5-year survival rate of ~11%. Moreover, because we will actively participate in the PDAC Consortium, the knowledge gained in these studies will be available for other studies of the immune tumor microenvironment in PDAC that are undertaken within the Consortium.

Although recent advances in immunotherapy have shown efficacy in various solid cancers, comparable efficacy in PDAC has been limited by a complex tumor microenvironment (TME) that creates an immune suppressive milieu ripe for tumor progression. Thus, bold interventions that can overcome immune barriers in the PDAC TME are urgently needed to reduce the mortality stemming from this recalcitrant disease. The U01 'Consortium for PDAC Translational Studies on the TME' was created through the National Cancer Moonshot initiative to accelerate the pace of progress in innovative therapies targeting the TME in PDAC, especially those geared towards immune-based modalities. Our proposal is in response to the companion U24 RFA to create a resource center for the five funded Consortium sites, which we call Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma Translational Resource Center (PATReC). The PATReC will be co-led by Drs. Ignacio Wistuba and Anirban Maitra, two established molecular pathologists at UT MD Anderson Cancer Center (UTMDACC) with long-standing expertise in cancer biomarkers, tissue based molecular profiling, and with respect to one co-leader (AM), specific expertise in PDAC biology, disease models and experimental therapeutics. They will be supported by an exceptional supporting cast, including Drs. Jack Lee (biostatistics), Andy Futreal (cancer genomics and computational biology), Jason Roszik (bioinformatics) and Stan Hamilton (co-leader of the NCI MATCH biorepository). The overall goal is to support the consortium efforts in multiple areas including: providing an administrative infrastructure for coordinated interactions amongst the U01 awardees; facilitating centralized biospecimen banking and distribution; enabling centralized data storage capabilities; and credentialed biostatistics and bioinformatics support with the ultimate goal of designing translationally relevant combination interventions targeting the TME in PDAC. In Aim 1, we will support administrative coordination amongst the U01 sites by ensuring effective communication, cooperation, and access to rapid data exchange that will advance the goals of the individual Consortium sites. The PATReC will serve as the central 'hub' for virtual and in-person communication across the entire Consortium. In Aim 2, we will utilize our unique institutional infrastructure to provide centralized data management services that will be readily accessible to all Consortium sites via a secure website, and provide bioinformatics and biostatics services for the analyses and interpretation of data. In Aim 3, we will standardize bio-banking activities and develop standard operation procedures (SOPs) for biospecimen collection, processing and distribution, as well as provide access to biologically relevant PDAC preclinical resources. We envision that the PATReC will be an indispensable element as we make meaningful progress towards targeting the TME in this lethal disease.",Administrative Coordination;Algorithms;Antigens;Archives;Area;Bioinformatics;Biological;Biology;Biometry;Cancer Center;Cancer Etiology;Cataloging;Catalogs;Cell Line;Cessation of life;Clinical Research;Clinical Trials;Clinical Trials Data Monitoring Committees;Collection;Communication;Companions;Complex;Computational Biology;Credentialing;Data;Data Analyses;Data Storage and Retrieval;Diagnosis;Disease;Disease model;Elements;Enrollment;Ensure;Facility Accesses;Funding;Goals;Image Analysis;Immune;Immunofluorescence Immunologic;Immunologic Monitoring;Immunotherapeutic agent;Immunotherapy;Incidence;Individual;Innovative Therapy;Institution;Intervention;Investigational Therapies;Laboratory Research;Lead;Logistics;Malignant Neoplasms;Manuals;Methodology;Modality;Molecular;Molecular Profiling;Online Systems;Organ;Organoids;Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma;Participant;Pathologic;Pathologist;Pathology;Patients;Persons;Play;Procedures;Reagent;Research Design;Research Infrastructure;Research Personnel;Resources;Role;Secure;Services;Site;Solid;Standardization;Survival Rate;Teleconferences;Therapeutic;Tissue Microarray;Tissues;Translational Research;Treatment Efficacy;United States;Xenograft procedure;base;biobank;cancer biomarkers;cancer genomics;cancer immunotherapy;clinically relevant;comparative efficacy;computerized tools;data exchange;data management;design;immune function;improved;innovation;material transfer agreement;meetings;member;mortality;multidisciplinary;operation;outcome forecast;pre-clinical;preclinical study;programs;prospective;response;stem;synergism;targeted treatment;tool;translational study;tumor microenvironment;tumor progression;virtual;web site,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,HOUSTON,TX,UNITED STATES,Anirban Maitra;Ignacio I.

One possible reason for this is the unique biology of the pancreatic cancer in establishing an immune suppressive microenvironment. We find that cross communication between cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs), tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) and tumor cells is critical. Using animal models of PDA, we find that tumor cells polarize macrophages to TAMs both by activating CAFs to produce IL6 and by producing specific metabolites. TAMs then both suppress the immune response by arginine depletion by making Arginase 1 and by producing EGFR ligands, primarily HBEGF, to stimulate pancreatic cancer cells to express PDL1, an immune checkpoint ligand. We propose to use a combination of matched humanized patient derived xenografts (PDXs), organoid culture systems made up of cancer cells, immune cells and CAFs (ie 'microtumors') and a unique dual recombinase genetically engineered mouse model of PDA to test the hypothesis that treatment of tumors with inhibitors of STAT3, HBEGF, ARG1 or MEK will effectively synergize with PD1 inhibition, overcoming the powerful immune suppression created by the pancreatic cancer microenvironment.",Ablation;Adenocarcinoma Cell;Affect;Animal Model;Antigen-Antibody Complex;Arginine;Biocompatible Materials;Biological Models;Biology;CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes;Cancer Patient;Cell Communication;Cells;Communication;Complex;DTR gene;Engineering;Environment;Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor;Epithelial;Epithelium;Feedback;Fibroblasts;Genetically Engineered Mouse;Goals;Growth Factor;Human;IL6 gene;Immune;Immune checkpoint inhibitor;Immune response;Immune system;Immunosuppression;Immunotherapeutic agent;Immunotherapy;In Vitro;Infiltration;Inflammatory;Interruption;Lead;Ligands;MAP Kinase Gene;MEK inhibition;MEKs;Malignant Neoplasms;Malignant neoplasm of pancreas;Mediating;Methods;Michigan;Modality;Myelogenous;Myeloid Cells;Myeloid-derived suppressor cells;Neoplasm Metastasis;Neoplasm Transplantation;Organoids;PD-1/PD-L1;Pancreas;Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma;Patients;Phenotype;Pre-Clinical Model;Process;Research;Research Personnel;Research Proposals;Role;STAT3 gene;Schools;Scientist;Series;Signal Transduction;System;T-Lymphocyte;Testing;Therapeutic;Transplantation;Tumor-associated macrophages;Universities;Work;Xenograft procedure;anti-tumor immune response;arginase;base;cancer cell;cancer immunotherapeutics;cancer therapy;checkpoint therapy;combat;cytokine;experience;fighting;immune checkpoint;in vivo;inhibitor/antagonist;innovation;intercellular communication;macrophage;medical schools;neoplastic cell;novel;pancreatic cancer cells;pancreatic neoplasm;polarized cell;programmed cell death ligand 1;programmed cell death protein 1;recombinase;response;scaffold;tumor;tumor growth;tumor microenvironment;tumor-immune system interactions,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,ANN ARBOR,MI,UNITED STATES,Howard C Crawford;Marina Pasca Di Magliano,Jeffrey Hildesheim,527973,527973,2020-09-21,2017-09-30,2022-08-31,RFA-CA-17-015,True duplicate in all columns.

Despite success in other cancer types, immunotherapy approaches in PDAC have not shown efficacy. PDAC demonstrates a heterogeneous and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) that is poorly understood and serves as a barrier to effective immunotherapy strategies in this disease. We propose that an improved understanding of the TME and novel approaches that target key tumor-stroma interactions will enable remodeling of the immunosuppressive TME to enhance the efficacy of current and future immunotherapy strategies. In particular, we believe that successful combination immunotherapy approaches in PDAC will include strategies that alter myeloid cells to relieve immunosuppression, cytotoxic therapies that target tumor cells to improve immune response, and agents that augment anti-tumor T cell activity. In this project, we will perform a comprehensive characterization of the PDAC TME in both primary and metastatic PDAC in the baseline untreated context as well as across multiple different clinical therapies. In Aim 1, we will utilize single-cell transcriptomic and proteomic technologies to provide a cellular atlas of the PDAC TME at unprecedented resolution. In Aim 2, we will examine how the PDAC TME changes with chemotherapy, radiation therapy and a novel CCR2 inhibitor that modulates macrophage recruitment in the TME. For these studies, we will utilize human samples derived from both resectable and metastatic patients on clinical trials at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. We will employ a novel ex vivo co-culture approach to enable rapid functional evaluation of tumor-stroma interactions and how they may impact immunotherapy responses. Lastly, in Aim 3 we will employ faithful immune competent PDAC mouse models and a novel cytokine delivery platform to investigate how targeted cytokine delivery to the TME may alter myeloid cell recruitment and function and improve immune responses.

The mechanisms underlying this benefit include 'normalization' of cancer-associated fibroblasts and extracellular matrix (ECM), resulting in blood vessel decompression, improved perfusion, and decreased hypoxia. These exciting preclinical findings formed the basis of an ongoing Phase II clinical trial at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), which combines losartan with cytotoxic therapy - FOLFIRINOX and then chemoradiotherapy in unresectable locally advanced PDAC (NCT01821729). An interim analysis of this trial indicates that adding losartan to neoadjuvant cytotoxic therapy doubles the frequency of conversion to resectable tumors (52%) and strikingly improves overall survival (OS) in these PDAC patients. Remarkably, transcriptomic analysis of tumor biopsies from PDAC patients further indicates that ASI treatment not only normalizes ECM-related phenotypes but also upregulates key pathways associated with anti-tumor immunity involving both adaptive (e.g., CD8+ T cells) and innate (e.g., dendritic cells (DCs)) immune components of the PDAC tumor microenvironment. Based on these preclinical and clinical findings, we hypothesize that ASIs in combination with cytotoxic agents will reprogram the heterogeneous, pro-fibrotic, and immunosuppressive PDAC tumor microenvironment to one that is immunostimulatory. We further propose that combining ASIs and cytotoxic agents will enhance the delivery and efficacy of immunotherapies, which until now have had limited or no benefit in PDAC patients. To test these hypotheses, we designed three Specific Aims: 1) Uncover how losartan combined with cytotoxic agents alters tumor microenvironmental components (ECM, blood vessels, hypoxia) and immune cells, in locally advanced PDAC patients; 2) Dissect the causal role of drug- induced adaptive and innate immune cells in the anti-tumor response in orthotopic (implanted and genetically engineered) PDAC models in mice; and 3) Evaluate whether combining ASI-induced tumor microenvironment reprogramming along with cytotoxic therapies enhances the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockers.

Although recent advances in immunotherapy have shown efficacy in various solid cancers, comparable efficacy in PDAC has been limited by a complex tumor microenvironment (TME) that creates an immune suppressive milieu ripe for tumor progression. Thus, bold interventions that can overcome immune barriers in the PDAC TME are urgently needed to reduce the mortality stemming from this recalcitrant disease. The U01 'Consortium for PDAC Translational Studies on the TME' was created through the National Cancer Moonshot initiative to accelerate the pace of progress in innovative therapies targeting the TME in PDAC, especially those geared towards immune-based modalities. Our proposal is in response to the companion U24 RFA to create a resource center for the five funded Consortium sites, which we call Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma Translational Resource Center (PATReC). The PATReC will be co-led by Drs. Ignacio Wistuba and Anirban Maitra, two established molecular pathologists at UT MD Anderson Cancer Center (UTMDACC) with long-standing expertise in cancer biomarkers, tissue based molecular profiling, and with respect to one co-leader (AM), specific expertise in PDAC biology, disease models and experimental therapeutics. They will be supported by an exceptional supporting cast, including Drs. Jack Lee (biostatistics), Andy Futreal (cancer genomics and computational biology), Jason Roszik (bioinformatics) and Stan Hamilton (co-leader of the NCI MATCH biorepository). The overall goal is to support the consortium efforts in multiple areas including: providing an administrative infrastructure for coordinated interactions amongst the U01 awardees; facilitating centralized biospecimen banking and distribution; enabling centralized data storage capabilities; and credentialed biostatistics and bioinformatics support with the ultimate goal of designing translationally relevant combination interventions targeting the TME in PDAC. In Aim 1, we will support administrative coordination amongst the U01 sites by ensuring effective communication, cooperation, and access to rapid data exchange that will advance the goals of the individual Consortium sites. The PATReC will serve as the central 'hub' for virtual and in-person communication across the entire Consortium. In Aim 2, we will utilize our unique institutional infrastructure to provide centralized data management services that will be readily accessible to all Consortium sites via a secure website, and provide bioinformatics and biostatics services for the analyses and interpretation of data. In Aim 3, we will standardize bio-banking activities and develop standard operation procedures (SOPs) for biospecimen collection, processing and distribution, as well as provide access to biologically relevant PDAC preclinical resources.

One possible reason for this is the unique biology of the pancreatic cancer in establishing an immune suppressive microenvironment. We find that cross communication between cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs), tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) and tumor cells is critical. Using animal models of PDA, we find that tumor cells polarize macrophages to TAMs both by activating CAFs to produce IL6 and by producing specific metabolites. TAMs then both suppress the immune response by arginine depletion by making Arginase 1 and by producing EGFR ligands, primarily HBEGF, to stimulate pancreatic cancer cells to express PDL1, an immune checkpoint ligand. We propose to use a combination of matched humanized patient derived xenografts (PDXs), organoid culture systems made up of cancer cells, immune cells and CAFs (ie 'microtumors') and a unique dual recombinase genetically engineered mouse model of PDA to test the hypothesis that treatment of tumors with inhibitors of STAT3, HBEGF, ARG1 or MEK will effectively synergize with PD1 inhibition, overcoming the powerful immune suppression created by the pancreatic cancer microenvironment.",Ablation;Affect;Animal Model;Antigen-Antibody Complex;Arginine;Biocompatible Materials;Biological Models;Biology;CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes;Cancer Patient;Cell Communication;Cells;Communication;Complex;DTR gene;Engineering;Environment;Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor;Epithelial;Feedback;Fibroblasts;Genetically Engineered Mouse;Goals;Growth Factor;Human;IL6 gene;Immune;Immune checkpoint inhibitor;Immune response;Immune system;Immunosuppression;Immunotherapeutic agent;Immunotherapy;In Vitro;Infiltration;Inflammatory;Interruption;Lead;Ligands;MAP Kinase Gene;MEK inhibition;MEKs;Malignant Neoplasms;Malignant neoplasm of pancreas;Mediating;Methods;Michigan;Modality;Myelogenous;Myeloid Cells;Myeloid-derived suppressor cells;Neoplasm Metastasis;Neoplasm Transplantation;Organoids;PD-1/PD-L1;Pancreas;Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma;Patients;Phenotype;Pre-Clinical Model;Process;Research;Research Personnel;Research Proposals;Role;STAT3 gene;Schools;Scientist;Series;Signal Transduction;System;T-Lymphocyte;Testing;Therapeutic;Transplantation;Tumor-associated macrophages;Universities;Work;anti-tumor immune response;arginase;base;cancer cell;cancer immunotherapeutics;cancer therapy;checkpoint therapy;combat;cytokine;experience;fighting;immune checkpoint;in vivo;inhibitor/antagonist;innovation;intercellular communication;macrophage;medical schools;neoplastic cell;novel;pancreatic cancer cells;pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cell;pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma model;pancreatic neoplasm;patient derived xenograft model;polarized cell;programmed cell death ligand 1;programmed cell death protein 1;recombinase;response;scaffold;tumor;tumor growth;tumor microenvironment;tumor-immune system interactions,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,ANN ARBOR,MI,UNITED STATES,Howard C Crawford;Marina Pasca Di Magliano,Jeffrey Hildesheim,527973,527973,2021-07-29,2017-09-30,2023-02-28,RFA-CA-17-015,True duplicate in all columns.

Despite success in other cancer types, immunotherapy approaches in PDAC have not shown efficacy. PDAC demonstrates a heterogeneous and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) that is poorly understood and serves as a barrier to effective immunotherapy strategies in this disease. We propose that an improved understanding of the TME and novel approaches that target key tumor-stroma interactions will enable remodeling of the immunosuppressive TME to enhance the efficacy of current and future immunotherapy strategies. In particular, we believe that successful combination immunotherapy approaches in PDAC will include strategies that alter myeloid cells to relieve immunosuppression, cytotoxic therapies that target tumor cells to improve immune response, and agents that augment anti-tumor T cell activity. In this project, we will perform a comprehensive characterization of the PDAC TME in both primary and metastatic PDAC in the baseline untreated context as well as across multiple different clinical therapies. In Aim 1, we will utilize single-cell transcriptomic and proteomic technologies to provide a cellular atlas of the PDAC TME at unprecedented resolution. In Aim 2, we will examine how the PDAC TME changes with chemotherapy, radiation therapy and a novel CCR2 inhibitor that modulates macrophage recruitment in the TME. For these studies, we will utilize human samples derived from both resectable and metastatic patients on clinical trials at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. We will employ a novel ex vivo co-culture approach to enable rapid functional evaluation of tumor-stroma interactions and how they may impact immunotherapy responses. Lastly, in Aim 3 we will employ faithful immune competent PDAC mouse models and a novel cytokine delivery platform to investigate how targeted cytokine delivery to the TME may alter myeloid cell recruitment and function and improve immune responses.

Neoantigen load predicts immunotherapeutic response, validating antigen identification as a rational strategy of biomarker discovery. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) however has shown limited efficacy to checkpoint blockade immunotherapy due to presumed neoantigen paucity. However, systematic antigen discovery in PDAC is lacking. 3% of PDAC patients survive > 5 years (long term survivors). As T cell immunity may explain this extreme outcome, they represent the ideal cohort for deep antigen discovery. Using genomic, molecular, and cellular immunoprofiling, computational evolutionary modeling, and neoantigen discovery in these rare long term survivors (n=82), we have discovered that neoantigen quality, but not quantity, is prognostic of survival, and that long term survivors evidence lasting neoantigen-specific T cell immunity. The scientific objectives of this proposal are to address questions essential to translate these findings - 1) is there stage and treatment- specific neoantigen heterogeneity, 2) can neoantigens be identified in the peripheral blood, and 3) can neoantigen quality predict response to immunotherapy. The translational objective is to develop novel tissue and blood-based biomarkers for rational patient and target selection for immunotherapy. The proposal utilizes several highly unique tissue collection strategies - a) laparoscopic multi-site biopsies to identify stage-specific heterogeneity, b) serial pre- and post-chemotherapy assessment for treatment-specific modulation, and c) evaluation of neoantigen quality as a predictive biomarker on a large, immunotherapeutic PDAC trial. This initiative will also for the first time develop the ability to identify neoantigens in circulating exosomes for blood-based biomarker assessment. The research methodology employs next generation sequencing, transcriptional profiling, computational biophysical modeling, clonotypic T cell profiling, neoantigen discovery, and functional assessments to evaluate the prognostic, predictive, and therapeutic potential of neoantigens. The team comprises of world-class expert junior and senior investigators in a broad range of highly relevant disciplines from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Meyer Cancer Center at the Weill Cornell Medical Center, Tisch Cancer Institute at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and the Institute for Advanced Study.

Recent progress has identified essential barriers in this complex microenvironment that impede drug delivery and suppress immunity. These processes include the prohibitive interstitial pressures generated by high concentrations of hyaluronan (HA) complexed with water, dense fibrosis associated with fibrillar collagen deposition, and multiple classes of immunosuppressive and pro-tumorigenic cells such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells and macrophages. The team assembled in this project has made many of the seminal discoveries described above. In addition, we have developed several highly novel and powerful experimental platforms to rigorously interrogate the complex mechanisms and interactions among various compartments in the tumor microenvironment that collectively conspire to promote the survival of pancreas cancers and metastases and thwart treatment.

Recent progress has identified essential barriers in this complex microenvironment that impede drug delivery and suppress immunity. These processes include the prohibitive interstitial pressures generated by high concentrations of hyaluronan (HA) complexed with water, dense fibrosis associated with fibrillar collagen deposition, and multiple classes of immunosuppressive and pro-tumorigenic cells such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells and macrophages. The team assembled in this project has made many of the seminal discoveries described above. In addition, we have developed several highly novel and powerful experimental platforms to rigorously interrogate the complex mechanisms and interactions among various compartments in the tumor microenvironment that collectively conspire to promote the survival of pancreas cancers and metastases and thwart treatment. Our overarching hypothesis is that significantly improving survival for PDA patients will require targeting not only the tumor epithelial cell, but also the three compartments that support its oncogenesis: hematopoietic, mesenchymal and extracellular matrix. In the following, we propose to investigate the combination of cytotoxic therapy with stromal disruption and myeloid cell modulations to maximize engagement of anti-tumor immunity and treatment efficacy. We will pursue these investigations in four distinct experimental platforms that offer complementary strengths and mitigate limitations: 1) genetically engineered mouse models (GEMM) of autochthonous PDA; 2) syngeneic allografts; 3) patient-derived xenograft (PDX) systems; and 4) patient-derived organoids (PDO).",,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER CENTER,Seattle,WA,UNITED STATES,Sunil R Hingorani,Jeffrey Hildesheim,257096,257096,2022-05-27,2017-09-30,2022-08-31,RFA-CA-17-015,True duplicate in all columns.

Despite success in other cancer types, immunotherapy approaches in PDAC have not shown efficacy. PDAC demonstrates a heterogeneous and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) that is poorly understood and serves as a barrier to effective immunotherapy strategies in this disease. We propose that an improved understanding of the TME and novel approaches that target key tumor-stroma interactions will enable remodeling of the immunosuppressive TME to enhance the efficacy of current and future immunotherapy strategies. In particular, we believe that successful combination immunotherapy approaches in PDAC will include strategies that alter myeloid cells to relieve immunosuppression, cytotoxic therapies that target tumor cells to improve immune response, and agents that augment anti-tumor T cell activity. In this project, we will perform a comprehensive characterization of the PDAC TME in both primary and metastatic PDAC in the baseline untreated context as well as across multiple different clinical therapies. In Aim 1, we will utilize single-cell transcriptomic and proteomic technologies to provide a cellular atlas of the PDAC TME at unprecedented resolution. In Aim 2, we will examine how the PDAC TME changes with chemotherapy, radiation therapy and a novel CCR2 inhibitor that modulates macrophage recruitment in the TME. For these studies, we will utilize human samples derived from both resectable and metastatic patients on clinical trials at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. We will employ a novel ex vivo co-culture approach to enable rapid functional evaluation of tumor-stroma interactions and how they may impact immunotherapy responses. Lastly, in Aim 3 we will employ faithful immune competent PDAC mouse models and a novel cytokine delivery platform to investigate how targeted cytokine delivery to the TME may alter myeloid cell recruitment and function and improve immune responses. We have assembled a multi-disciplinary collaborative team including experts in PDAC biology and genetics, immunologists and translational oncologists to comprehensively study PDAC TME and identify novel opportunities to develop combination immunotherapy approaches in this devastating disease.",Aftercare;Atlases;Biology;Biopsy;Biopsy Specimen;CC chemokine receptor 2;CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes;Cancer Patient;Cells;Clinical;Clinical Trials;Coculture Techniques;Combined Modality Therapy;Complex;Cytotoxic Chemotherapy;Cytotoxic agent;Dana-Farber Cancer Institute;Desmoplastic;Devices;Disease;Elements;Evaluation;Evolution;Excision;FLT3LG gene;Fibroblasts;Future;Genetic;Genetically Engineered Mouse;Genomics;Heterogeneity;Human;Immune;Immune response;Immunofluorescence Immunologic;Immunologist;Immunosuppression;Immunosuppressive Agents;Immunotherapy;Infiltration;Interferon Type II;Interleukin-15;Lung Adenocarcinoma;Malignant - descriptor;Malignant Neoplasms;Malignant neoplasm of pancreas;Methods;Microfluidic Microchips;Microfluidics;Modeling;Mus;Myelogenous;Myeloid Cells;Nature;Neoadjuvant Therapy;Non-Malignant;Oncologist;Paclitaxel;Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma;Pathway interactions;Patient-Focused Outcomes;Patients;Periodicity;Phase;Phenotype;Play;Pre-Clinical Model;Proteomics;Radiation;Radiation therapy;Randomized;Recruitment Activity;Regimen;Renal Cell Carcinoma;Research;Resectable;Resolution;Role;Sampling;Specimen;Survival Rate;T cell response;T-Lymphocyte;Technology;Testing;Therapeutic;Therapeutic Agents;base;cancer type;cell type;chemotherapy;cytokine;effective therapy;gemcitabine;immune checkpoint blockade;immunoregulation;improved;inhibitor/antagonist;macrophage;melanoma;mouse model;multidisciplinary;neoplastic cell;novel;novel strategies;outcome forecast;pre-clinical;prevent;programs;response;spatial relationship;success;targeted delivery;targeted treatment;therapeutic evaluation;transcriptome;transcriptome sequencing;transcriptomics;tumor;tumor heterogeneity;tumor microenvironment,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,BOSTON,MA,UNITED STATES,William C Hahn,Steven F Nothwehr,1845039,1845039,2017-09-22,2017-09-30,2020-08-31,RFA-CA-17-015,True duplicate in all columns.

Neoantigen load predicts immunotherapeutic response, validating antigen identification as a rational strategy of biomarker discovery. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) however has shown limited efficacy to checkpoint blockade immunotherapy due to presumed neoantigen paucity. However, systematic antigen discovery in PDAC is lacking. 3% of PDAC patients survive > 5 years (long term survivors). As T cell immunity may explain this extreme outcome, they represent the ideal cohort for deep antigen discovery. Using genomic, molecular, and cellular immunoprofiling, computational evolutionary modeling, and neoantigen discovery in these rare long term survivors (n=82), we have discovered that neoantigen quality, but not quantity, is prognostic of survival, and that long term survivors evidence lasting neoantigen-specific T cell immunity. The scientific objectives of this proposal are to address questions essential to translate these findings - 1) is there stage and treatment- specific neoantigen heterogeneity, 2) can neoantigens be identified in the peripheral blood, and 3) can neoantigen quality predict response to immunotherapy. The translational objective is to develop novel tissue and blood-based biomarkers for rational patient and target selection for immunotherapy. The proposal utilizes several highly unique tissue collection strategies - a) laparoscopic multi-site biopsies to identify stage-specific heterogeneity, b) serial pre- and post-chemotherapy assessment for treatment-specific modulation, and c) evaluation of neoantigen quality as a predictive biomarker on a large, immunotherapeutic PDAC trial. This initiative will also for the first time develop the ability to identify neoantigens in circulating exosomes for blood-based biomarker assessment. The research methodology employs next generation sequencing, transcriptional profiling, computational biophysical modeling, clonotypic T cell profiling, neoantigen discovery, and functional assessments to evaluate the prognostic, predictive, and therapeutic potential of neoantigens. The team comprises of world-class expert junior and senior investigators in a broad range of highly relevant disciplines from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Meyer Cancer Center at the Weill Cornell Medical Center, Tisch Cancer Institute at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and the Institute for Advanced Study.

grant,1U01CA224348-01,U01CA224348,9457862,2017,Reprogramming PDAC tumor microenvironment to improve immunotherapy,"We have recently shown in preclinical studies using clinically relevant pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) models that angiotensin system inhibitors (ASIs), including the angiotensin receptor blocker losartan, can enhance the delivery and efficacy of cytotoxic agents by affecting the tumor microenvironment (PNAS 2011, Nat Commun 2013). The mechanisms underlying this benefit include 'normalization' of cancer-associated fibroblasts and extracellular matrix (ECM), resulting in blood vessel decompression, improved perfusion, and decreased hypoxia. These exciting preclinical findings formed the basis of an ongoing Phase II clinical trial at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), which combines losartan with cytotoxic therapy - FOLFIRINOX and then chemoradiotherapy in unresectable locally advanced PDAC (NCT01821729). An interim analysis of this trial indicates that adding losartan to neoadjuvant cytotoxic therapy doubles the frequency of conversion to resectable tumors (52%) and strikingly improves overall survival (OS) in these PDAC patients. Remarkably, transcriptomic analysis of tumor biopsies from PDAC patients further indicates that ASI treatment not only normalizes ECM-related phenotypes but also upregulates key pathways associated with anti-tumor immunity involving both adaptive (e.g., CD8+ T cells) and innate (e.g., dendritic cells (DCs)) immune components of the PDAC tumor microenvironment. Based on these preclinical and clinical findings, we hypothesize that ASIs in combination with cytotoxic agents will reprogram the heterogeneous, pro-fibrotic, and immunosuppressive PDAC tumor microenvironment to one that is immunostimulatory. We further propose that combining ASIs and cytotoxic agents will enhance the delivery and efficacy of immunotherapies, which until now have had limited or no benefit in PDAC patients. To test these hypotheses, we designed three Specific Aims: 1) Uncover how losartan combined with cytotoxic agents alters tumor microenvironmental components (ECM, blood vessels, hypoxia) and immune cells, in locally advanced PDAC patients; 2) Dissect the causal role of drug- induced adaptive and innate immune cells in the anti-tumor response in orthotopic (implanted and genetically engineered) PDAC models in mice; and 3) Evaluate whether combining ASI-induced tumor microenvironment reprogramming along with cytotoxic therapies enhances the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockers. Based on our preclinical and clinical data, our tightly integrated and multidisciplinary team of investigators, and our bench-to-bedside-and-back research approach, we anticipate that successful completion of these studies will positively impact the development of new treatments for locally advanced PDAC patients who currently have a 5-year survival rate of ~11%. Moreover, because we will actively participate in the PDAC Consortium, the knowledge gained in these studies will be available for other studies of the immune tumor microenvironment in PDAC that are undertaken within the Consortium.

Neoantigen load predicts immunotherapeutic response, validating antigen identification as a rational strategy of biomarker discovery. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) however has shown limited efficacy to checkpoint blockade immunotherapy due to presumed neoantigen paucity. However, systematic antigen discovery in PDAC is lacking. 3% of PDAC patients survive > 5 years (long term survivors). As T cell immunity may explain this extreme outcome, they represent the ideal cohort for deep antigen discovery. Using genomic, molecular, and cellular immunoprofiling, computational evolutionary modeling, and neoantigen discovery in these rare long term survivors (n=82), we have discovered that neoantigen quality, but not quantity, is prognostic of survival, and that long term survivors evidence lasting neoantigen-specific T cell immunity. The scientific objectives of this proposal are to address questions essential to translate these findings - 1) is there stage and treatment- specific neoantigen heterogeneity, 2) can neoantigens be identified in the peripheral blood, and 3) can neoantigen quality predict response to immunotherapy. The translational objective is to develop novel tissue and blood-based biomarkers for rational patient and target selection for immunotherapy. The proposal utilizes several highly unique tissue collection strategies - a) laparoscopic multi-site biopsies to identify stage-specific heterogeneity, b) serial pre- and post-chemotherapy assessment for treatment-specific modulation, and c) evaluation of neoantigen quality as a predictive biomarker on a large, immunotherapeutic PDAC trial. This initiative will also for the first time develop the ability to identify neoantigens in circulating exosomes for blood-based biomarker assessment. The research methodology employs next generation sequencing, transcriptional profiling, computational biophysical modeling, clonotypic T cell profiling, neoantigen discovery, and functional assessments to evaluate the prognostic, predictive, and therapeutic potential of neoantigens. The team comprises of world-class expert junior and senior investigators in a broad range of highly relevant disciplines from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Meyer Cancer Center at the Weill Cornell Medical Center, Tisch Cancer Institute at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and the Institute for Advanced Study.

Recent progress has identified essential barriers in this complex microenvironment that impede drug delivery and suppress immunity. These processes include the prohibitive interstitial pressures generated by high concentrations of hyaluronan (HA) complexed with water, dense fibrosis associated with fibrillar collagen deposition, and multiple classes of immunosuppressive and pro-tumorigenic cells such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells and macrophages. The team assembled in this project has made many of the seminal discoveries described above. In addition, we have developed several highly novel and powerful experimental platforms to rigorously interrogate the complex mechanisms and interactions among various compartments in the tumor microenvironment that collectively conspire to promote the survival of pancreas cancers and metastases and thwart treatment. Our overarching hypothesis is that significantly improving survival for PDA patients will require targeting not only the tumor epithelial cell, but also the three compartments that support its oncogenesis: hematopoietic, mesenchymal and extracellular matrix. In the following, we propose to investigate the combination of cytotoxic therapy with stromal disruption and myeloid cell modulations to maximize engagement of anti-tumor immunity and treatment efficacy. We will pursue these investigations in four distinct experimental platforms that offer complementary strengths and mitigate limitations: 1) genetically engineered mouse models (GEMM) of autochthonous PDA; 2) syngeneic allografts; 3) patient-derived xenograft (PDX) systems; and 4) patient-derived organoids (PDO).",Allografting;Architecture;Autologous;Behavior;Biological Models;Biology;Blood Vessels;Cancer Etiology;Cell Therapy;Cells;Cessation of life;Characteristics;Clinic;Coculture Techniques;Collagen;Complement;Complex;Cytotoxic Chemotherapy;Deposition;Disease;Disease Progression;Drug Delivery Systems;Education;Elements;Epithelial Cells;Evolution;Experimental Models;Extracellular Matrix;Extracellular Matrix Proteins;Fibrillar Collagen;Fibroblasts;Fibrosis;Friends;Functional disorder;Gel;Genetically Engineered Mouse;Glycosaminoglycans;Hematopoietic;Human;Hyaluronan;Immune;Immune response;Immunity;Immunosuppression;Immunotherapeutic agent;Investigation;Liquid substance;Malignant neoplasm of pancreas;Mechanics;Mesenchymal;Minority;Modeling;Mus;Myeloid Cells;Myeloid-derived suppressor cells;Myofibroblast;Neoplasm Metastasis;Normal tissue morphology;Organ;Organoids;Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma;Pathogenesis;Patients;Perfusion;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phase;Physiologic pulse;Physiology;Population;Process;Proteoglycan;Regimen;Research Personnel;Seminal;Series;Signal Transduction;Structure;Surface;System;T-Lymphocyte;Toxic effect;Treatment Efficacy;Treatment Protocols;Tumor Immunity;Water;Xenograft procedure;barrier to care;cell type;combinatorial;cytotoxic;hypoperfusion;improved;insight;interstitial;macrophage;monocyte;mouse model;next generation;novel;novel therapeutics;pressure;receptor;reconstitution;response;standard of care;therapy resistant;treatment strategy;tumor;tumor growth;tumor microenvironment;tumor-immune system interactions;tumorigenesis;tumorigenic,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,SEATTLE,WA,UNITED STATES,Sunil R Hingorani,Jeffrey Hildesheim,602955,602955,2020-09-01,2017-09-30,2022-08-31,RFA-CA-17-015,True duplicate in all columns.

The mechanisms underlying this benefit include 'normalization' of cancer-associated fibroblasts and extracellular matrix (ECM), resulting in blood vessel decompression, improved perfusion, and decreased hypoxia. These exciting preclinical findings formed the basis of an ongoing Phase II clinical trial at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), which combines losartan with cytotoxic therapy - FOLFIRINOX and then chemoradiotherapy in unresectable locally advanced PDAC (NCT01821729). An interim analysis of this trial indicates that adding losartan to neoadjuvant cytotoxic therapy doubles the frequency of conversion to resectable tumors (52%) and strikingly improves overall survival (OS) in these PDAC patients. Remarkably, transcriptomic analysis of tumor biopsies from PDAC patients further indicates that ASI treatment not only normalizes ECM-related phenotypes but also upregulates key pathways associated with anti-tumor immunity involving both adaptive (e.g., CD8+ T cells) and innate (e.g., dendritic cells (DCs)) immune components of the PDAC tumor microenvironment. Based on these preclinical and clinical findings, we hypothesize that ASIs in combination with cytotoxic agents will reprogram the heterogeneous, pro-fibrotic, and immunosuppressive PDAC tumor microenvironment to one that is immunostimulatory. We further propose that combining ASIs and cytotoxic agents will enhance the delivery and efficacy of immunotherapies, which until now have had limited or no benefit in PDAC patients. To test these hypotheses, we designed three Specific Aims: 1) Uncover how losartan combined with cytotoxic agents alters tumor microenvironmental components (ECM, blood vessels, hypoxia) and immune cells, in locally advanced PDAC patients; 2) Dissect the causal role of drug- induced adaptive and innate immune cells in the anti-tumor response in orthotopic (implanted and genetically engineered) PDAC models in mice; and 3) Evaluate whether combining ASI-induced tumor microenvironment reprogramming along with cytotoxic therapies enhances the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockers. Based on our preclinical and clinical data, our tightly integrated and multidisciplinary team of investigators, and our bench-to-bedside-and-back research approach, we anticipate that successful completion of these studies will positively impact the development of new treatments for locally advanced PDAC patients who currently have a 5-year survival rate of ~11%. Moreover, because we will actively participate in the PDAC Consortium, the knowledge gained in these studies will be available for other studies of the immune tumor microenvironment in PDAC that are undertaken within the Consortium.

Although recent advances in immunotherapy have shown efficacy in various solid cancers, comparable efficacy in PDAC has been limited by a complex tumor microenvironment (TME) that creates an immune suppressive milieu ripe for tumor progression. Thus, bold interventions that can overcome immune barriers in the PDAC TME are urgently needed to reduce the mortality stemming from this recalcitrant disease. The U01 'Consortium for PDAC Translational Studies on the TME' was created through the National Cancer Moonshot initiative to accelerate the pace of progress in innovative therapies targeting the TME in PDAC, especially those geared towards immune-based modalities. Our proposal is in response to the companion U24 RFA to create a resource center for the five funded Consortium sites, which we call Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma Translational Resource Center (PATReC). The PATReC will be co-led by Drs. Ignacio Wistuba and Anirban Maitra, two established molecular pathologists at UT MD Anderson Cancer Center (UTMDACC) with long-standing expertise in cancer biomarkers, tissue based molecular profiling, and with respect to one co-leader (AM), specific expertise in PDAC biology, disease models and experimental therapeutics. They will be supported by an exceptional supporting cast, including Drs. Jack Lee (biostatistics), Andy Futreal (cancer genomics and computational biology), Jason Roszik (bioinformatics) and Stan Hamilton (co-leader of the NCI MATCH biorepository). The overall goal is to support the consortium efforts in multiple areas including: providing an administrative infrastructure for coordinated interactions amongst the U01 awardees; facilitating centralized biospecimen banking and distribution; enabling centralized data storage capabilities; and credentialed biostatistics and bioinformatics support with the ultimate goal of designing translationally relevant combination interventions targeting the TME in PDAC. In Aim 1, we will support administrative coordination amongst the U01 sites by ensuring effective communication, cooperation, and access to rapid data exchange that will advance the goals of the individual Consortium sites. The PATReC will serve as the central 'hub' for virtual and in-person communication across the entire Consortium. In Aim 2, we will utilize our unique institutional infrastructure to provide centralized data management services that will be readily accessible to all Consortium sites via a secure website, and provide bioinformatics and biostatics services for the analyses and interpretation of data. In Aim 3, we will standardize bio-banking activities and develop standard operation procedures (SOPs) for biospecimen collection, processing and distribution, as well as provide access to biologically relevant PDAC preclinical resources. We envision that the PATReC will be an indispensable element as we make meaningful progress towards targeting the TME in this lethal disease.",Administrative Coordination;Algorithms;Antigens;Archives;Area;Bioinformatics;Biological;Biology;Biometry;Cancer Center;Cancer Etiology;Cataloging;Catalogs;Cell Line;Cessation of life;Clinical Management;Clinical Research;Clinical Trials;Clinical Trials Data Monitoring Committees;Collection;Communication;Companions;Complex;Computational Biology;Credentialing;Data;Data Analyses;Data Storage and Retrieval;Diagnosis;Disease;Disease model;Elements;Enrollment;Ensure;Facility Accesses;Funding;Goals;Immune;Immunofluorescence Immunologic;Immunologic Monitoring;Immunotherapeutic agent;Immunotherapy;Incidence;Individual;Infrastructure;Innovative Therapy;Institution;Intervention;Investigational Therapies;Laboratory Research;Lead;Logistics;Malignant Neoplasms;Manuals;Methodology;Modality;Molecular;Molecular Profiling;Organ;Organoids;Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma;Participant;Pathologic;Pathologist;Pathology;Patients;Persons;Play;Procedures;Reagent;Research Design;Research Personnel;Resources;Role;Secure;Services;Site;Solid;Standardization;Survival Rate;Teleconferences;Therapeutic;Tissue Microarray;Tissues;Translational Research;Treatment Efficacy;United States;Xenograft procedure;automated image analysis;base;biobank;cancer biomarkers;cancer genomics;cancer immunotherapy;clinically relevant;comparative efficacy;computerized tools;data dissemination;data exchange;data management;data tools;design;immune function;improved;innovation;material transfer agreement;meetings;member;mortality;multidisciplinary;operation;outcome forecast;pre-clinical;preclinical study;programs;prospective;response;stem;synergism;targeted treatment;tool;translational study;tumor microenvironment;tumor progression;virtual;web portal;web site,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,HOUSTON,TX,UNITED STATES,Anirban Maitra;Subrata Sen,Peter Ujhazy,559976,559976,2020-09-03,2017-09-30,2022-08-31,RFA-CA-17-016,True duplicate in all columns.

The scientific objectives of this proposal are to address questions essential to translate these findings - 1) is there stage and treatment- specific neoantigen heterogeneity, 2) can neoantigens be identified in the peripheral blood, and 3) can neoantigen quality predict response to immunotherapy. The translational objective is to develop novel tissue and blood-based biomarkers for rational patient and target selection for immunotherapy. The proposal utilizes several highly unique tissue collection strategies - a) laparoscopic multi-site biopsies to identify stage-specific heterogeneity, b) serial pre- and post-chemotherapy assessment for treatment-specific modulation, and c) evaluation of neoantigen quality as a predictive biomarker on a large, immunotherapeutic PDAC trial. This initiative will also for the first time develop the ability to identify neoantigens in circulating exosomes for blood-based biomarker assessment. The research methodology employs next generation sequencing, transcriptional profiling, computational biophysical modeling, clonotypic T cell profiling, neoantigen discovery, and functional assessments to evaluate the prognostic, predictive, and therapeutic potential of neoantigens. The team comprises of world-class expert junior and senior investigators in a broad range of highly relevant disciplines from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Meyer Cancer Center at the Weill Cornell Medical Center, Tisch Cancer Institute at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and the Institute for Advanced Study.

Recent progress has identified essential barriers in this complex microenvironment that impede drug delivery and suppress immunity. These processes include the prohibitive interstitial pressures generated by high concentrations of hyaluronan (HA) complexed with water, dense fibrosis associated with fibrillar collagen deposition, and multiple classes of immunosuppressive and pro-tumorigenic cells such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells and macrophages. The team assembled in this project has made many of the seminal discoveries described above. In addition, we have developed several highly novel and powerful experimental platforms to rigorously interrogate the complex mechanisms and interactions among various compartments in the tumor microenvironment that collectively conspire to promote the survival of pancreas cancers and metastases and thwart treatment. Our overarching hypothesis is that significantly improving survival for PDA patients will require targeting not only the tumor epithelial cell, but also the three compartments that support its oncogenesis: hematopoietic, mesenchymal and extracellular matrix. In the following, we propose to investigate the combination of cytotoxic therapy with stromal disruption and myeloid cell modulations to maximize engagement of anti-tumor immunity and treatment efficacy. We will pursue these investigations in four distinct experimental platforms that offer complementary strengths and mitigate limitations: 1) genetically engineered mouse models (GEMM) of autochthonous PDA; 2) syngeneic allografts; 3) patient-derived xenograft (PDX) systems; and 4) patient-derived organoids (PDO).",Allografting;Architecture;Autologous;Behavior;Biological Models;Biology;Blood Vessels;Cancer Etiology;Cell Therapy;Cells;Cessation of life;Characteristics;Clinic;Coculture Techniques;Collagen;Complement;Complex;Cytotoxic Chemotherapy;Deposition;Disease;Disease Progression;Drug Delivery Systems;Education;Elements;Epithelial Cells;Evolution;Experimental Models;Extracellular Matrix;Extracellular Matrix Proteins;Fibrillar Collagen;Fibroblasts;Fibrosis;Friends;Functional disorder;Gel;Genetically Engineered Mouse;Glycosaminoglycans;Hematopoietic;Human;Hyaluronan;Immune;Immune response;Immunity;Immunosuppression;Immunotherapeutic agent;Investigation;KPC model;Liquid substance;Malignant neoplasm of pancreas;Mechanics;Mesenchymal;Minority;Modeling;Mus;Myeloid Cells;Myeloid-derived suppressor cells;Myofibroblast;Neoplasm Metastasis;Normal tissue morphology;Organ;Organoids;Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma;Pathogenesis;Patients;Perfusion;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phase;Physiologic pulse;Physiology;Population;Process;Proteoglycan;Regimen;Research Personnel;Seminal;Series;Signal Transduction;Structure;Surface;System;T-Lymphocyte;Toxic effect;Treatment Efficacy;Treatment Protocols;Tumor Immunity;Water;barrier to care;cell type;combinatorial;cytotoxic;hypoperfusion;improved;insight;interstitial;macrophage;monocyte;mouse model;next generation;novel;novel therapeutics;patient derived xenograft model;pressure;receptor;reconstitution;response;standard of care;therapy resistant;treatment strategy;tumor;tumor growth;tumor microenvironment;tumor-immune system interactions;tumorigenesis;tumorigenic,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,SEATTLE,WA,UNITED STATES,Sunil R Hingorani,Jeffrey Hildesheim,345859,345859,2021-08-10,2017-09-30,2022-03-31,RFA-CA-17-015,True duplicate in all columns.

grant,5U01CA224348-03,U01CA224348,10251378,2021,Reprogramming PDAC tumor microenvironment to improve immunotherapy,"We have recently shown in preclinical studies using clinically relevant pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) models that angiotensin system inhibitors (ASIs), including the angiotensin receptor blocker losartan, can enhance the delivery and efficacy of cytotoxic agents by affecting the tumor microenvironment (PNAS 2011, Nat Commun 2013). The mechanisms underlying this benefit include 'normalization' of cancer-associated fibroblasts and extracellular matrix (ECM), resulting in blood vessel decompression, improved perfusion, and decreased hypoxia. These exciting preclinical findings formed the basis of an ongoing Phase II clinical trial at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), which combines losartan with cytotoxic therapy - FOLFIRINOX and then chemoradiotherapy in unresectable locally advanced PDAC (NCT01821729). An interim analysis of this trial indicates that adding losartan to neoadjuvant cytotoxic therapy doubles the frequency of conversion to resectable tumors (52%) and strikingly improves overall survival (OS) in these PDAC patients. Remarkably, transcriptomic analysis of tumor biopsies from PDAC patients further indicates that ASI treatment not only normalizes ECM-related phenotypes but also upregulates key pathways associated with anti-tumor immunity involving both adaptive (e.g., CD8+ T cells) and innate (e.g., dendritic cells (DCs)) immune components of the PDAC tumor microenvironment. Based on these preclinical and clinical findings, we hypothesize that ASIs in combination with cytotoxic agents will reprogram the heterogeneous, pro-fibrotic, and immunosuppressive PDAC tumor microenvironment to one that is immunostimulatory. We further propose that combining ASIs and cytotoxic agents will enhance the delivery and efficacy of immunotherapies, which until now have had limited or no benefit in PDAC patients. To test these hypotheses, we designed three Specific Aims: 1) Uncover how losartan combined with cytotoxic agents alters tumor microenvironmental components (ECM, blood vessels, hypoxia) and immune cells, in locally advanced PDAC patients; 2) Dissect the causal role of drug- induced adaptive and innate immune cells in the anti-tumor response in orthotopic (implanted and genetically engineered) PDAC models in mice; and 3) Evaluate whether combining ASI-induced tumor microenvironment reprogramming along with cytotoxic therapies enhances the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockers. Based on our preclinical and clinical data, our tightly integrated and multidisciplinary team of investigators, and our bench-to-bedside-and-back research approach, we anticipate that successful completion of these studies will positively impact the development of new treatments for locally advanced PDAC patients who currently have a 5-year survival rate of ~11%. Moreover, because we will actively participate in the PDAC Consortium, the knowledge gained in these studies will be available for other studies of the immune tumor microenvironment in PDAC that are undertaken within the Consortium. Through this work, we will develop innovative approaches to enhance anti-tumor immunity in this intractable disease.",Address;Affect;Angiotensin II;Angiotensin Receptor;Angiotensins;Animal Model;Antitumor Response;Back;Biopsy;Blood Vessels;CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes;Cancer Center;Cells;Characteristics;Clinical;Clinical Data;Clinical Trials;Collaborations;Combined Modality Therapy;Cytotoxic Chemotherapy;Cytotoxic agent;Data;Dendritic Cells;Desmoplastic;Development;Disease;Extracellular Matrix;Fibroblasts;Fostering;Frequencies;Future;General Hospitals;Genetic Engineering;Goals;Human;Hypoxia;Immune;Immunity;Immunosuppression;Immunotherapy;Implant;Infiltration;Innate Immune Response;Knowledge;Losartan;Malignant Neoplasms;Massachusetts;Mediating;Minority;Mus;Natural Immunity;Neoadjuvant Therapy;Outcome;Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma;Pathway interactions;Patients;Perfusion;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phase II Clinical Trials;Phenotype;Population;Pre-Clinical Model;Process;Research;Research Personnel;Resectable;Resected;Resistance;Role;Sampling;Signal Transduction;Survival Rate;System;Systemic Therapy;T cell response;T-Lymphocyte;Testing;Therapeutic;Treatment Efficacy;Tumor Immunity;Tumor-infiltrating immune cells;Unresectable;Work;adaptive immunity;base;bench to bedside;cell type;chemoradiation;clinically relevant;cytotoxic;design;efficacy testing;immune checkpoint blockers;improved;inhibitor/antagonist;innovation;insight;macrophage;multidisciplinary;novel;pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma model;pre-clinical;preclinical study;recruit;transcriptomics;tumor;tumor growth;tumor microenvironment;tumor-immune system interactions,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,BOSTON,MA,UNITED STATES,Yves Boucher;Rakesh K.

Although recent advances in immunotherapy have shown efficacy in various solid cancers, comparable efficacy in PDAC has been limited by a complex tumor microenvironment (TME) that creates an immune suppressive milieu ripe for tumor progression. Thus, bold interventions that can overcome immune barriers in the PDAC TME are urgently needed to reduce the mortality stemming from this recalcitrant disease. The U01 'Consortium for PDAC Translational Studies on the TME' was created through the National Cancer Moonshot initiative to accelerate the pace of progress in innovative therapies targeting the TME in PDAC, especially those geared towards immune-based modalities. Our proposal is in response to the companion U24 RFA to create a resource center for the five funded Consortium sites, which we call Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma Translational Resource Center (PATReC). The PATReC will be co-led by Drs. Ignacio Wistuba and Anirban Maitra, two established molecular pathologists at UT MD Anderson Cancer Center (UTMDACC) with long-standing expertise in cancer biomarkers, tissue based molecular profiling, and with respect to one co-leader (AM), specific expertise in PDAC biology, disease models and experimental therapeutics. They will be supported by an exceptional supporting cast, including Drs. Jack Lee (biostatistics), Andy Futreal (cancer genomics and computational biology), Jason Roszik (bioinformatics) and Stan Hamilton (co-leader of the NCI MATCH biorepository). The overall goal is to support the consortium efforts in multiple areas including: providing an administrative infrastructure for coordinated interactions amongst the U01 awardees; facilitating centralized biospecimen banking and distribution; enabling centralized data storage capabilities; and credentialed biostatistics and bioinformatics support with the ultimate goal of designing translationally relevant combination interventions targeting the TME in PDAC. In Aim 1, we will support administrative coordination amongst the U01 sites by ensuring effective communication, cooperation, and access to rapid data exchange that will advance the goals of the individual Consortium sites. The PATReC will serve as the central 'hub' for virtual and in-person communication across the entire Consortium. In Aim 2, we will utilize our unique institutional infrastructure to provide centralized data management services that will be readily accessible to all Consortium sites via a secure website, and provide bioinformatics and biostatics services for the analyses and interpretation of data. In Aim 3, we will standardize bio-banking activities and develop standard operation procedures (SOPs) for biospecimen collection, processing and distribution, as well as provide access to biologically relevant PDAC preclinical resources. We envision that the PATReC will be an indispensable element as we make meaningful progress towards targeting the TME in this lethal disease.",Administrative Coordination;Algorithms;Antigens;Archives;Area;Bioinformatics;Biological;Biological Specimen Banks;Biology;Biometry;Cancer Center;Cancer Etiology;Cataloging;Cell Line;Cessation of life;Clinical Management;Clinical Research;Clinical Trials;Clinical Trials Data Monitoring Committees;Collection;Communication;Companions;Complex;Computational Biology;Credentialing;Data;Data Analyses;Data Storage and Retrieval;Diagnosis;Disease;Disease model;Elements;Enrollment;Ensure;Facility Accesses;Funding;Goals;Immune;Immunofluorescence Immunologic;Immunologic Monitoring;Immunotherapeutic agent;Immunotherapy;Incidence;Individual;Infrastructure;Innovative Therapy;Institution;Intervention;Investigational Therapies;Laboratory Research;Lead;Logistics;Malignant Neoplasms;Manuals;Methodology;Modality;Molecular;Molecular Profiling;Organ;Organoids;Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma;Participant;Pathologic;Pathologist;Pathology;Patients;Persons;Play;Procedures;Prognosis;Reagent;Research Design;Research Personnel;Resources;Role;Secure;Services;Site;Solid;Standardization;Survival Rate;Teleconferences;Therapeutic;Tissue Microarray;Tissues;Translational Research;Treatment Efficacy;United States;automated image analysis;base;biobank;cancer biomarkers;cancer genomics;cancer immunotherapy;clinically relevant;comparative efficacy;computerized tools;data dissemination;data exchange;data management;data tools;design;immune function;improved;innovation;material transfer agreement;meetings;member;mortality;multidisciplinary;operation;patient derived xenograft model;pre-clinical;preclinical study;programs;prospective;response;stem;synergism;targeted treatment;tool;translational study;tumor microenvironment;tumor progression;virtual;web portal;web site,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,HOUSTON,TX,UNITED STATES,Anirban Maitra;Subrata Sen,Peter Ujhazy,559976,559976,2021-08-12,2017-09-30,2022-08-31,RFA-CA-17-016,True duplicate in all columns.

PEP-CTN clinical trials will incorporate correlative genomics, biology, pharmacology, and imaging studies to further the understanding of the disposition and action of new agents introduced into the treatment of children with cancer. Annually, the PEP-CTN will enroll approximately 120 children and adolescents with cancer onto clinical trials of novel anticancer agents at the 21 core premier pediatric oncology sites throughout the country. The network institutions are selected through a peer review process, and serve as a national and international model for new agent development in pediatric oncology. The PEP- CTN will leverage the database infrastructure and resources of the parent Children's Oncology Group while maintaining its own administrative and operational infrastructure to ensure rapid development, implementation, and reporting of specialized and complex early phase clinical trials. The PEP-CTN has expertise and resources for the conduct of translational biology, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacogenetic studies, and utilizes state-of-the-art informatics systems to facilitate the transfer of response and correlative imaging studies for central review and analyses. The PEP-CTN's primary specific aims are: 1) To safely and efficiently introduce novel anticancer agents into the pediatric setting through the conduct of early phase clinical trials; 2) To expeditiously obtain preliminary efficacy signals through use of phase 2 expansion cohorts and pilot studies in order to inform tumor specific trials that will be conducted across COG sites; 3) To perform genomic analyses, including single gene studies or gene panels, to identify appropriate patients for early phase studies of targeted agents; 4) To identify associations of tumor characteristics with response to new agents using genomic analyses such as whole exome sequencing and RNA sequencing; 5) To incorporate pharmacologic and biologic endpoints, including circulating tumor DNA, other translational laboratory studies, and imaging modalities, into early phase studies, in order to enhance our understanding of the new agents and their effect on tumors..

The long-term goal of the Mosse and Maris translational research programs is to substantively improve neuroblastoma cure rates by developing patient-specific therapies that target the unique oncogenic drivers of each case. Within the context of the National Cancer Institute's Pediatric In Vivo Testing Program (Ped-In Vivo-TP) we propose a Neuroblastoma Research Program built on richly annotated and highly characterized patient derived xenograft (PDX) and other recently developed murine models of this disease. The central hypothesis to be tested in this Program is that neuroblastoma-specific oncogenic drivers and optimal immunotherapeutic targets can be defined and exploited through rationally designed therapies based on validated and clinically measurable biomarkers. Through our dedicated focus on neuroblastoma and our central role in the former Pediatric Preclinical Testing Program and Consortium, we have developed an investigative team and rich set of resources and reagents to be uniquely positioned to achieve the goals of the Ped-In Vivo-TP. Here we propose to use a large (and growing) collection of PDX models that have been fully characterized with the most modern genomic technologies to address the challenge of prioritizing the large armamentarium of anti-cancer agents in development so that early phase biomarker-driven clinical trials can be designed with the objective of showing potent and specific anti-tumor activity. We propose three specific aims directed towards 1) developing and characterizing highly annotated models of human neuroblastoma; 2) performing preclinical trials with drugs directed against defined therapeutic vulnerabilities in order to prioritize agents for the clinic, and 3) developing the portfolio of preclinical data required for design of clinical trials with robust biomarkers for patient selection and monitoring. In collaboration with other preclinical testing programs, we will seek to determine if discoveries in our program are relevant to other childhood cancers and collaborate across disease groups on clinical development strategies. Thus, this Program will seek to shift the paradigm for how high-risk neuroblastoma patients are treated with the goal of substantively improving the outcomes, both in terms of cure rates, but also by decreasing the toxicity associated with current standards of care.",Address;Adolescent;Adrenocortical carcinoma;Adult;Allografting;Antineoplastic Agents;Biological Assay;Biological Markers;Caring;Cause of Death;Cessation of life;Chemotherapy and/or radiation;Child;Child Development;Childhood;Clinic;Clinical;Clinical Trials;Clinical Trials Design;Collaborations;Collection;Communities;Coupled;Data;Development;Diagnosis;Disease;Disease model;Drug Modelings;Drug Targeting;Foundations;Funding;Genetic Fingerprintings;Genetic Predisposition to Disease;Genomics;Glioma;Goals;Health;Immunooncology;Immunotherapeutic agent;Immunotherapy;In Vitro;Industry;Inflammatory Pseudotumor;Infrastructure;Ki-1 Large-Cell Lymphoma;Knowledge;Leadership;MYCN gene;Malignant Childhood Neoplasm;Malignant Neoplasms;Measurable;Mission;Modeling;Modernization;Molecular;Morbidity - disease rate;Mus;National Cancer Institute;Neoplasm Metastasis;Neuroblastoma;Oncogenic;Patient Monitoring;Patient Selection;Patients;Pediatric Oncology;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacology;Phase;Play;Positioning Attribute;Pre-Clinical Model;Preclinical Testing;Public Health;Radiation therapy;Reagent;Recurrent disease;Relapse;Research;Resource Sharing;Resources;Role;Sampling;Series;Solid;Solid Neoplasm;Survivors;Technology;Testing;Therapeutic;Therapeutic Intervention;Therapeutic Trials;Toxic effect;Translating;Treatment Failure;United States National Institutes of Health;Work;anticancer research;base;biomarker-driven;chemotherapy;clinical development;companion diagnostics;design;disorder risk;drug testing;early phase clinical trial;evidence base;high risk;human model;improved;improved outcome;in vivo;in vivo evaluation;individualized medicine;infancy;innovation;melanoma;mouse model;next generation sequencing;novel;novel therapeutics;patient biomarkers;patient derived xenograft model;pre-clinical;preclinical trial;programs;public-private partnership;rare condition;refractory cancer;response;screening;targeted treatment;therapy design;tool;translational research program;tumor,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,PHILADELPHIA,PA,UNITED STATES,Yael P Mosse,Malcolm M Smith,712800,712800,2021-06-24,2021-07-01,2026-06-30,RFA-CA-20-034,True duplicate in all columns.

Accordingly, there is a pressing need for clinically relevant preclinical studies that can help prioritize pediatric indications for clinical application of nearly the entire universe of cancer drugs currently in development. To meet this need, we established a preclinical testing program that has created >300 genomically-characterized pediatric solid tumor patient- derived xenograft (PDX) models between the pediatric oncology programs at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and University of California San Francisco. We propose to leverage this large portfolio of models across a diversity of diseases, along with the deep expertise of the team, to establish a NCI Pediatric In Vivo Testing Program (Ped-In Vivo-TP) Research Team focused on pediatric bone and soft tissue sarcomas, renal tumors, desmoplastic small round cell tumor (DSRCT) and other rare pediatric solid tumors. The Aims of this Research Team are: Aim 1. Integrate with the Coordinating Center and other Research Teams to prioritize agents for preclinical evaluation. We will leverage our team's translational expertise as well as existing connections to disease committees within cooperative groups to inform and facilitate new agent selection and preclinical evaluation in appropriate models to prioritize agents to advance into pediatric oncology clinical trials. Aim 2. Utilize PDX portfolios representative of disease heterogeneity to assess therapeutic agents. We will utilize the >300 PDX models from MSKCC and UCSF, supplemented with models from the PROXC consortium where necessary, to assess 8-10 therapeutic agents/year using study designs matched to the therapeutic question. All preclinical drug testing will be conducted at MSKCC. Aim 3. Align central and local data analyses to ensure rigor in results reporting. For the purposes of prioritization, we will maintain equipoise in validating ('go') or invalidating ('no go') therapeutic hypotheses, and will complement central data analyses with advanced local biostatistical expertise. Aim 4. Translational biomarker discovery. We will leverage the combined expertise of our Research Team to identify clinically translatable biomarkers predictive of enhanced response or drug resistance. In some cases, predictive biomarkers may not be genetic, but instead will depend on transcriptional or protein-based assays of target activity. In other cases, genomically identified biomarkers have to be translated to clinically utilizable assays.

For children with recurrent disease, survival is below 30%, and long-term survivors have an increased burden of disease associated with the curative therapies they received. Therefore, the goal of our research team is to improve the survival and quality of life of children with STS by integrating basic, translational, and clinical research. For the past 10 years, we have consented STS and other solid tumor patients to donate tissue for orthotopic implantation into immunocompromised mice to develop orthotopic patient derived xenografts (O-PDXs). Our O-PDXs have been used for ex vivo high- throughput drug screening and in vivo testing using a standardized preclinical phase I, II, III paradigm. Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is the most common STS in children and genomic studies have shown that rare subsets of clonally related cells can survive treatment and contribute to disease recurrence. Subsequent integrated analyses using transcriptomic, epigenetic and proteomic data showed that RMS tumors retain lineage-specific transcriptional and epigenetic signatures of their developmental origins. More recently, single cell and single nucleus RNA-seq (sc/snRNA-seq) and in vivo lineage-tracing showed that clones of cells can transition through their normal developmental programs. Indeed, single- cell ATAC-seq demonstrated that the cell- and developmental stage-specific super-enhancer activity is correlated with those clonal changes in gene expression. Chemotherapy eliminates the most proliferative tumor cell populations, and the surviving dormant tumor cells rapidly expand and re- establish their developmental hierarchy, which leads to disease recurrence. This is a striking example of the complex cell-intrinsic and -extrinsic signaling within STS and the intricate connection between developmental and oncogenic pathways in childhood cancer. In this proposal, we will perform in vivo testing for 8-10 drugs per year using our STS O-PDX models.

Consequently, the number of patients that can be enrolled in phase I/II clinical trials is small, and most patients will have been extensively treated, hence drug/radiation resistant. Thus, preclinical studies that accurately translate into effective clinical therapy are an essential component of pediatric drug development. Our group has contributed to studies in the PPTP/C that have led to clinical studies through Children's Oncology Group (COG). Of importance, we have developed and characterized over 330 Patient Derived Xenografts (PDX), developed from tumors both at diagnosis and relapse, that can be used to facilitate pediatric drug development as directed by FDA under the Research to Accelerate Cures and Equity for Children Act (RACE for Children Act). Based on our studies, both in and outside the PPTC, we propose to use PDX/CDX models of sarcoma, kidney cancer, and hepatoblastoma derived from high-risk patients to identify novel agents and combinations, and to test at least 8-10 agents per year, for which we have expertise. We will explore specific hypotheses to integrate molecular-targeted agents with conventional chemo-radiation treatment, advanced drug delivery systems (antibody-drug conjugates, nanoparticles), and the use of Single Mouse Testing (SMT) as the primary screening approach. In collaborative studies, we will evaluate a new humanized mouse model where testing of immuno-oncology agents is a priority to treat these PDX models. One of the objective limitations of PPTP/C testing was that relatively few tumor models representing a specific disease (n=3-8/disease) could be used within the resource constraints, a number clearly insufficient to recapitulate the genetic/epigenetic heterogeneity of each clinical disease. Our retrospective analysis of PPTP data, and recent prospective testing in the PPTC, shows that a single mouse/tumor line gives essentially similar data to conventional testing' (using 10 mice/group for each tumor line). The advantage of the SMT design is that it allows for incorporation of up to 20-fold more models, more accurately representing the genetic/epigenetic diversity of each pediatric cancer within the same resource constraints. The proposed studies will adopt SMT as the primary screening approach to identify agents that have biologically meaningful activity (i.e. large antitumor effects) and identify tumors that are `exceptional responders' for validation. The SMT approach, when linked to the molecular characterization of PDX models, potentially increases the power to identify biomarkers associated with response. Using SMT we can essentially conduct preclinical phase II trials and simulate the likely clinical response rate more accurately for a given disease. As part of the Ped-In Vivo-TP, we aim to develop highly effective, less toxic therapies for high-risk cancers that afflict children and adolescents/young adults (AYA).",Adolescent;Adopted;Alveolar;Antibody-drug conjugates;Biological;Biological Markers;Brain Neoplasms;CD276 gene;Cell Line;Characteristics;Child;Childhood;Childhood Cancer Treatment;Childhood Solid Neoplasm;Clinical;Clinical Research;Clinical Trials;Clinical Trials Design;Combined Modality Therapy;Cyclophosphamide;DNA Damage;DNA Repair;Data;Databases;Development;Diagnosis;Disease;Disease-Free Survival;Dose;Drug Combinations;Drug Delivery Systems;Drug Formulations;Drug Targeting;Embryonal Rhabdomyosarcoma;Enrollment;Epigenetic Process;Ewings sarcoma;Experimental Designs;Foundations;Genetic;Goals;Growth;Hepatoblastoma;Heterogeneity;High-Risk Cancer;Immunooncology;In complete remission;Investigation;Life;Link;Lipids;MAP Kinase Gene;MAPK Signaling Pathway Pathway;MEKs;Malignant - descriptor;Malignant Childhood Neoplasm;Malignant Neoplasms;Malignant neoplasm of liver;Modeling;Molecular;Molecular Target;Mus;Mutation;Nephroblastoma;New Agents;Operative Surgical Procedures;Outcome;Pathway interactions;Patients;Pediatric Oncology Group;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phase;Phase I/II Clinical Trial;Pre-Clinical Model;Preclinical Testing;Probability;Protocols documentation;ROR1 gene;Radiation therapy;Relapse;Renal carcinoma;Reproducibility;Research;Resistance;Resources;Rhabdoid Tumor;Rhabdomyosarcoma;Signal Transduction;Sirolimus;Solid Neoplasm;Surface;Test Result;Testing;Therapeutic;Translating;Trastuzumab;United States National Institutes of Health;Validation;Vinca Alkaloids;Xenograft Model;Xenograft procedure;antitumor effect;base;cancer cell;cancer type;chemoradiation;chemotherapy;clinical development;design;disorder risk;efficacy evaluation;exceptional responders;exome sequencing;expectation;high risk;high risk population;humanized mouse;improved;in vivo;inhibitor/antagonist;irinotecan;kidney clear cell sarcoma;leukemia;mouse model;mutant;nano;nanoformulation;nanoparticle;nanosystems;neoplastic cell;novel;novel therapeutics;patient derived xenograft model;patient stratification;pediatric drug development;pediatric patients;phase II trial;pre-clinical;preclinical study;programs;prospective test;public-private partnership;radiation resistance;radioresistant;repaired;response;response biomarker;sarcoma;screening;small molecule;success;systemic toxicity;targeted agent;transcriptome sequencing;translational impact;tumor;young adult,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCIENCE CENTER,SAN ANTONIO,TX,UNITED STATES,Peter J Houghton;Raushan Kurmasheva,Malcolm M Smith,600685,600685,2021-08-03,2021-09-01,2026-06-30,RFA-CA-20-034,True duplicate in all columns.

To coordinate the activities of the new Ped-In Vivo-TP initiative, we have assembled a team of investigators from The Jackson Laboratory (JAX) and Seven Bridges Genomics (SB) with unique combined expertise and experience with in vivo cancer models, scalable cloud-based data management and analysis systems, informatics resource development, and multi-site project coordination. Combining the complementary strengths of JAX and SB provides the ideal foundation for a coordinating center to maximize the short- and long-term impacts of the Pediatric In Vivo Testing Program for advancing the application of precision medicine in pediatric oncology. We will manage a comprehensive and cohesive testing program to advance precision medicine in pediatric oncology through effective public-private partnerships among pharmaceutical companies, regulatory agencies, funders, and research organizations. We will achieve this goal through the following aims: Aim 1: Establish and maintain the Pediatric In Vivo Testing Coordinating Center (PIVOT CC) to provide administrative and logistical support for diverse stakeholders in the Pediatric in Vivo Testing Program consortium. We will draw on our team's combined decades of experience with multi-site program management, cancer model development, standardized testing of in vivo cancer models, data management and analysis, and informatics resource development to ensure timely decision making, conformance to standard protocols, resource tracking, and effective communications within the Ped-In Vivo-TP. Aim 2: Provide data management, statistical, and bioinformatics support to ensure data security and integrity. We will leverage existing protocols and software systems at JAX and SB to identify relevant in vivo cancer models and to collect, analyze, and securely manage data generated from testing centers within the consortium. We will perform statistical and bioinformatic analyses on consortium data to reliably inform the evaluation of the efficacy of novel therapeutic agents in a pediatric oncology setting. We will develop a public- facing data portal for sharing of data and methods with the broader scientific community. Aim 3: Provide scientific coordination to maintain an efficient and effective preclinical testing pipeline. We will draw from the extensive experience of our team with in vivo pharmacology and coordination of similar consortia to manage and coordinate the testing of agents by the Ped-In Vivo-TP centers at all stages of the process, from the identification of relevant in vivo models to the generation of final technical reports and publication of results.

Recent US Government legislation, combined with the relative rarity and higher cure rates of childhood cancer compared with adults, emphasize the importance of new agent preclinical testing programs aimed at maximizing the likelihood that only the most active drugs will be advanced into early phase clinical trials. The broad aim of this application is to improve the treatment options for children with aggressive and/or drug resistant ALL by prioritizing new drugs for clinical trials in the disease using state-of-the-art preclinical experimental models. This aim will be accomplished using a large panel of 90 pediatric ALL patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) that have undergone a high level of cell and molecular characterization and authentication. The PDXs to be used in this study were all established as models of orthotopic disease in immune- deficient (NOD/SCID or NSG) mice from direct patient explants without prior ex vivo culture. The PDXs develop as systemic disease in NSG mice and infiltrate the same major organs in mice as the primary disease in human patients. Engraftment and responses to treatment are monitored by measuring the proportion of human leukemia cells in the peripheral blood of mice on a weekly basis, which provides a reliable representation of overall leukemia burden in the animals. Where luciferase-expressing PDXs are available, this testing will be augmented by bioluminescence imaging of animals. The broad methodology will involve inoculation of PDX cells into NSG mice, a lag time to allow the disease to establish, followed by drug treatment and monitoring to assess drug responses. Methods of response evaluation have been developed using stringent criteria modeled after the clinical setting, in order to minimize the likelihood of over-predicting drug responses in mice leading to failure of drugs in the clinic. The proposed drug testing will adopt multiple formats, including conventional drug testing (6- 10 mice/group), single-mouse trial testing (1 PDX x 1 mouse x 1 drug) and testing of new agents in combination with standard-of-care drugs. In this fashion, this Research Program aims to test 8-10 new agents per year.

Our lab's long- term mission is to identify novel molecular targets in osteosarcoma via comprehensive genomic and proteomic profiling of patient-derived cell lines and xenografts as well as human tumors with the ultimate goal of identifying and/or developing and testing therapeutics against these targets. To achieve this goal, we have a) built a robust profiling platform to identify novel targets; b) expanded our repertoire of osteosarcoma patient derived xenograft (PDX) models to reflect disease heterogeneity; and c) conducted high-throughput in vivo testing of 8-10 new agents each year both as part of Pediatric Preclinical Testing Consortium (PPTC) as well as independent of it. All of these efforts form the basis of our current research proposal and place us strongly poised to successfully achieve our goals. Our overall objective is to efficiently evaluate the efficacy of new agents with high potential to have activity in osteosarcoma based on target data from our genomic and proteomic profiling both as single agents and in rational combinations, with the vision of moving effective agents into clinical trials through the Children's Oncology Group. We have three specific aims- 1) to select and test agents in vivo against surface targets identified by comprehensive proteomic profiling of osteosarcoma xenografts and patient tumors; 2) to select and test agents in vivo against targets identified by comprehensive genomic profiling of osteosarcoma xenografts and patient tumors; and 3) to perform testing of rationally combined agents based on target, toxicity and efficacy data of single agents. Agents from the PPTC pipeline will be selected based on either the proteomic target or genomic alteration being present in at least a subset of available osteosarcoma PDX models. The agent will be tested in selected cohorts of low/ high expressing protein target or present/ absent genomic alteration. In cases with multiple models with target expression, 3-5 mice per model will be used and in cases with few models available, 8-10 mice per model will be used for control and experiment groups with an overall n per arm per experiment of approximately 30 mice. Standard PPTC procedures will be used for tumor implantation and treatment. Tumor dimensions will be measured twice a week and response quantified as per standard PPTC definitions of complete response, maintained complete response, partial response, stable disease and progressive disease. For combination studies, three potential types of combinations will be considered based on efficacy and toxicity data- a) two surface protein targeted agents such as two antibody-drug conjugates; 2) two molecularly targeted agents and 3) a surface protein targeted agent and a molecularly targeted agent.

Specifically, we propose to continue the in vivo testing program for central nervous system (CNS) tumors using our panel of patient derived orthotopic xenograft (PDOX) models. Brain tumor is the leading cause of cancer-related death in children. One of the challenges in clinical drug development is how to effectively prioritize drug candidates to ensure clinical success in cancer patients. However, efforts in identifying new anti-cancer agents for that are most likely to be effective in the clinic have been blocked for many years due to the lack of clinically relevant and molecularly accurate model system. Fortunately, we have established a panel of 150 PDOX models of pediatric brain tumors through direct injection of patient tumor specimens into the brains of SCID mice. These PDOX models are shown to have replicated the histopathology and major genetic abnormalities of the original patient tumors even during serial sub-transplantations in vivo in mouse brains. They not only represent different clinical stage (i.e., at diagnosis, relapse and terminal/autopsy) but also replicate a broad spectrum of the newly identified molecular subtypes of nearly all types of pediatric brain tumors. The xenograft tumor cells can also be cryopreserved for sustained and on-demand supply of tumorigenic PDOX cells. This capacity combined with our optimized surgical procedure, with which we can implant up to 260 mice per day, makes it possible for us to test multiple (e.g., 6-10) drugs per year for every tumor type. Our objective is therefore to make use of this unique panel of PDOX models to examine therapeutic efficacy of new agents and to analyze mechanisms of action and therapy resistance in high grade glioma, medulloblastoma, ependymoma, DIPG and ATRT. Our hypothesis is that these patient-specific PDOX tumors will respond to anti-cancer therapies similarly to the corresponding human primary tumors, and the effective agents identified through this system would have better chances of clinical success. To test this hypothesis, we will perform a series of in vitro and in vivo assays to achieve the following aims: 1) to identify genetically accurate candidate PDOX models that bear the therapeutic target(s) of new investigational drugs through data mining of our mouse model molecular characterization databases; 2) to select the most responsive models through functional in vitro screening to determine time- and dose-responses; 3) to demonstrate therapeutic efficacy of new investigational drugs in multiple target-bearing PDOX models; and 4) to perform detailed analysis of cellular and molecular mechanisms of cell killing as well as the causes of therapy resistance both in vitro and in vivo. Our novel panel of PDOX mouse models represents a broad spectrum of genetic abnormalities of pediatric CNS tumors. All the assays are well established and routinely performed in our laboratory; we are uniquely positioned to accomplish the proposed drug studies in vivo.

Currently, cancer registries in the U.S. hold structured information on every cancer case, including pediatric cancers, within their respective catchment areas. For childhood cancer patients and survivors, issues of late effects, recurrence, subsequent malignant neoplasms (SMN), and follow-up are critically important to consider and further study. It is also important to address survivors' life trajectories, which often include moving to different states and away from where their data was initially collected. The aim of the National Childhood Cancer Registry (NCCR) is to build a connected data infrastructure that includes longitudinal data from multiple sources and enables secure sharing of childhood cancer data with vetted research investigators. These efforts will support childhood cancer research and provide a population-level dataset on all childhood cancer patients. As a base for the infrastructure, data currently collected at targeted cancer registries, including those in the Surveillance Epidemiology & End Results (SEER) program, will be used to aggregate key information on childhood cancer patients and survivors. In addition to registry data, NCCR aims to incorporate unique data sources including the National Death Index (NDI), State vital records, LexisNexis (residential history and social determinants of health data), and Virtual Pooled Registry (VPR) data on subsequent primaries, as well as pharmacy and radiation oncology data. Additional categories of information that may be integrated into the database include detailed diagnostic characterization of the tumor, treatment information, indicators of tumor recurrence, identification of multiple primary cancers, and genomic characterization of initial and potentially recurrent disease. The Department of Energy (DOE)/Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) is the largest multipurpose science laboratory in the DOE national laboratory system. The mission of ORNL is to deliver scientific discoveries and technical breakthroughs that will accelerate the development and deployment of solutions to meet pressing global challenges aligned with the DOE's goals. This 'science-to-solutions' mission depends on the integration and application of distinctive capabilities in basic and applied research, which include leadership positions and capabilities in high-performance computing (HPC), advanced visualization and data fusion, and computational science and systems engineering and integration. ORNL is recognized as a leader in the research and development of health and data sciences. In the DOE national laboratory system, ORNL has a highly capable and proven data and computing enclave certified to host and analyze protected health information (PHI). ORNL's capabilities, certified systems that accommodate PHI, HPC capabilities and facilities, and the technical expertise that has proven successful in a recent multi-year project with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), Department of Veteran's Affairs (VA) and its broader engagement with the National Institutes of Health (NIH), are unmatched in the domestic private sector, making ORNL uniquely qualified to perform the work required for this effort. With growing complexity of cancer diagnosis and treatment, the national cancer surveillance program faces increasing challenges in capturing essential information needed to better understand the effectiveness of cancer treatments in the context of our complex medical and social environment. The capacity to collect automatically and comprehensively information about cancer patients would enhance the ability of cancer registry data to support a broad variety of cancer research and would provide an infrastructure that would permit evaluation of the generalizability of cancer diagnostics and therapies outside the clinical trials setting to the 97% of the general population not covered by clinical trials. These advances will be important in future healthcare applications beyond cancer, and the knowledge gained will be directly related to technology for future HPC architectures and for making HPC more available to biomedical research. The Current DOE collaboration with NIH/NCI, known as the Joint Design of Advanced Computing Solutions for Cancer, has produced several useful tools and documentation which have been utilized by the cancer surveillance community for adult cancer populations. In particular, ORNL has developed deep learning models and modalities of data analytics that are of particular interest to the NCCR. Their expertise and development of various tools using information from multiple data sources can be used to support various data queries, provide assessment of feasibility of developing trials, and enabling comparisons of key characteristics among the entire population of childhood cancer patients at a population level to compare to patients enrolled in clinical trials (e.g. Children's Oncology Group [COG]). Furthermore, their expertise and computing capabilities will enable NCI to refine and develop scaling mechanisms of existing data extraction algorithms to obtain data from text documentation in pediatric cancer abstracts that would otherwise be difficult to obtain. This infrastructure will serve as the central data index and warehouse for childhood cancer data through large-scale data identification and linkages and has the potential to provide real-world evidence to support data-driven clinical guidelines. These developed tools combined with this data infrastructure will also support a broad range of research questions. Through the shared follow-up information across registries and other data linkage sources, annual follow-up data will be greatly enhanced for childhood cancer survivors and pediatric oncology research. The purpose of this agreement is to provide funding to 1) support the development and refinement of advanced computational tools (e.g., artificial intelligence, knowledge graph, graph analytics, text extraction algorithms, predictive modeling, and other advanced computational methodologies) using key data from the NCCR infrastructure and various other external data sources, and 2) utilize NCCR to further refine existing tools developed by DOE/ORNL.",Address;Adolescent and Young Adult;Adult;Agreement;Algorithmic Software;Algorithms;Applied Research;Architecture;Artificial Intelligence;Basic Science;Biomedical Research;Cancer Burden;Cancer Diagnostics;Cancer Patient;Cancer Survivor;Catchment Area;Categories;Cessation of life;Characteristics;Clinical;Clinical Trials;Collaborations;Communities;Complex;Computational Science;Computing Methodologies;Data;Data Analytics;Data Linkages;Data Science;Data Set;Data Sources;Databases;Department of Energy;Development;Diagnostic;Documentation;Effectiveness;Engineering;Enrollment;Evaluation;Face;Funding;Future;General Population;Goals;Graph;Guidelines;Health;Health Sciences;Healthcare;High Performance Computing;Infrastructure;Joints;Knowledge;Laboratories;Late Effects;Leadership;Life;Malignant Childhood Neoplasm;Malignant Neoplasms;Medical;Mission;Modality;National Cancer Institute;Patients;Pediatric Oncology;Pediatric Oncology Group;Pharmacy facility;Population;Positioning Attribute;Private Sector;Radiation Oncology;Recording of previous events;Records;Recurrence;Recurrent disease;Registries;Research;Research Personnel;SEER Program;Science;Secure;Social Environment;Source;Structure;Surveillance Program;Survivors;System;Technical Expertise;Technology;Text;United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services;United States Department of Veterans Affairs;United States National Institutes of Health;Visualization;Work;anticancer research;base;cancer diagnosis;cancer genomics;cancer therapy;childhood cancer survivor;computerized tools;data fusion;data infrastructure;data registry;data sharing;deep learning model;design;follow-up;health data;indexing;interest;knowledge graph;large scale data;multiple data sources;neoplasm registry;predictive modeling;research and development;social health determinants;symposium;tool;tumor;virtual,NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE,,,UNITED STATES,Joe Lake,,1500000,1500000,,,,,Mismatched values in columns with same node_id.
