This platform contains control probes for background correction and spike-in hybridization. Tiling of KSHV, EBV, and control cellular and reporter genes were initially tiled with 60bp oligomers with 30bp overlap (straight tiling). Major repeats were represtented once. Initial experiments (not associated with the corresponding article) were performed to determine regions with significant background hybridization. These regions were retiled according to Best-Tm and Best-Distribution methodologies available on the eArray website for custom microarray design (earray.chem.agilent.com). Gaps were tolerated at <300 bp, with some exceptions as described in the methods section of the corresponding article. All non-Agilent based probes were present in triplicate.",GPL15030,8,Homo sapiens; human gammaherpesvirus 4; Human gammaherpesvirus 8,2011/12/30,,ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/platforms/GPL15nnn/GPL15030/,
