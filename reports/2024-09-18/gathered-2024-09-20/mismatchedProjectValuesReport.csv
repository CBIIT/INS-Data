Over 4000 members of the Group including oncology physicians, statisticians, clinical research associates, oncology nurses, pharmacists, epidemiologists, and basic scientists participate in these studies. From 25-35 Phase Ill protocols are active at any one time, along with Phase II and Phase I studies that provide preliminary data required for the appropriate design of large scale randomized trials. In 2001 the CALGB accrued nearly 6662 entries to its protocols. Multidisciplinary disease committees of the Group design and implement protocols for the treatment of patients with leukemia, lymphoma, breast, respiratory, GI and GU cancers and melanoma. Modality committees, including Leukemia Correlative Sciences, Solid Tumor Correlative Sciences, Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, Surgery, Pathology, Radiation Oncology, Transplant, Cancer in the Elderly, Cancer Control and Health Outcomes, Oncology Nursing, and Clinical Research Associates serve as the sites for planning and implementing new approaches for these disciplines. Major areas of emphasis in CALGB include development of innovative treatments for patients with cancer; studies of molecular predictors of prognosis and response to therapy; studies of the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and pharmacogenetics of new and established anticancer drugs; evaluation of minimally invasive surgical techniques; determining the cost and cost-effectiveness of new cancer therapies; evaluating the impact of cancer and its treatment on the quality of life of cancer patients and their caregivers; developing new strategies for cancer prevention; and addressing the needs of special populations, particularly minorities and the elderly.

From 25-30 phase III protocols are active at any one time, along with phase II and phase I studies that provide preliminary data required for the appropriate design of large scale randomized trials. Multidisciplinary disease committees of the Group design and implement protocols for the treatment of patients with leukemia, lymphoma, breast, respiratory, Gl and GU cancer. Modality committees, including Leukemia Correlative Sciences, Imaging, Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, Surgery, Transplant, Cancer in the Elderly, Cancer Control and Health Outcomes, and Oncology Nursing provide expertise that enhances the contribution of these disciplines to CALGB studies. Scientific resources committees, including Clinical Research Associates, Pathology and Radiation Oncology, provide essential quality assurance and training activities for the Group. Major areas of emphasis in CALGB include development of innovative treatments for patients with cancer; studies of molecular predictors of prognosis and response to therapy; studies of the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and pharmacogenetics of new and established anticancer drugs; evaluation of minimally invasive surgical techniques and novel imaging technologies; determining the cost and cost-effectiveness of new cancer therapies; evaluating the impact of cancer and its treatment on the quality of life of cancer patients and their caregivers; developing new strategies for cancer prevention; and addressing the needs of special populations, particularly minorities and the elderly.

However, the late effects of cancer treatment, including permanent organ and tissue damage, hormonal and reproductive dysfunction and second cancers, are of special concern, with more than 40% of the estimated 360,000 survivors of childhood cancer experiencing a significant health-related quality of life complication from childhood cancer and its treatment. In addition, progress for a number of childhood cancers remains limited with approximately 50% of children with acute myelogenous leukemia, 50% of children with high-risk neuroblastoma, and more than 90% of children with brainstem glioma, still succumbing to their disease. The Children’s Oncology Group (COG), the world’s largest organization devoted exclusively to childhood and adolescent cancer research, and its multidisciplinary research teams comprised of more than 9,000 members, conducts research at more than 220 leading children’s hospitals, universities, and cancer centers. This proposal is for the COG NCI Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP) Research Base to continue its collaborative research work for our 26 community and 16 minority/underserved NCORP sites.

Precision cancer medicine, which seeks to exploit unique cellular, molecular and genetic characteristics of individual tumors to optimize treatment, remains a critically unmet need. Despite advances in biomarker technologies that yield high-quality cellular and genomic data, critical gaps remain to consistently match patients with cancer and ideal therapies. While `predictive' genomic assays based on RNA and DNA are now commonplace, current methods largely ignore tumor phenotypes differentiable by quantitative imaging. The overarching vision for VU-PREDICT is a suite of quantitative imaging tools that facilitate the discovery of novel, predictive imaging-derived gene expression signatures; such signatures can be deployed by the greater oncology community to improve the personalization of cancer treatment. The linchpin of VU-PREDICT will be positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. The sensitive and quantitative nature of PET, coupled with the ability to produce biologically active PET tracers, renders PET uniquely capable of both detecting tumors and profiling their specific features. Complementary to genomic approaches, PET imaging provides a quantitative, functional measure of tumor phenotype, and when coupled biopsy approaches, can provide a significantly greater breadth of biological characterization. VU-PREDICT centers on a parallel co-clinical trial of patients with advanced colorectal cancer (CRC) and human-in-mouse PDX (patient-derived xenograft) models. CRC is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs; cetuximab, panitumumab) are approved for treatment of advanced wild-type (WT) RAS CRC. However, durable responses to anti-EGFR mAbs occur in only 12–17% of patients. VU-PREDICT will capitalize upon a Phase I/II clinical trial opening at Vanderbilt combining a glutaminase (GLS1) inhibitor (CB-839, Calithera), EGFR mAb therapy (panitumumab) and irinotecan in patients with advanced and refractory WT RAS CRC. It is anticipated that combining CB-839 with EGFR mAb therapy will resensitize refractory CRC patients with Gln- avid tumors to EGFR blockade.

1U54CA221204-01,U54CA221204,9404820,2017,The Zambia AIDS Malignancies Diagnosis and Pathogenesis Program (ZAMDAPP),"ABSTRACT The establishment of the Zambia AIDS Malignancies Diagnosis and Pathogenesis Program (ZAMDAPP) will support the U.S.-Zambia collaborations necessary to develop a robust cancer research infrastructure at Zambia’s Cancer Diseases Hospital (CDH) and University Teaching Hospital (UTH), with an initial focus on Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS) and ocular surface squamous neoplasia (OSSN) – two of the most common occurring HIV/AIDS-associated malignancies in the country. ZAMDAPP will, for the first time, provide a mechanism by which R01-style research projects led by Zambian scientists trained through the Fogarty International AIDS International Research and Training Program (AITRP, D43TW001429) and AIDS Malignancies Training and Research Program (AMTRP, D43TW010354) may be conducted in three areas critical to cancer research – virology, biostatistics and epidemiology, and cancer diagnostics. The Zambian personnel leading the research projects will benefit from mentoring by U.S. partners and support by a number of research core facilities. ZAMDAPP will leverage strengths in clinical care and treatment at CDH and UTH; strengths in molecular viral oncology research and cancer genomics at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln; and strengths in pathology, epidemiology, and biostatistics at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, while extending the work that has been accomplished through AITRP and AMTRP, which provide support for trainees to pursue advanced degrees. In addition to providing research funding, ZAMDAPP will provide diverse training activities in the United States and Zambia to engage the next generation of Zambian cancer researchers, increase local expertise, and enhance the transfer of technology. The partnership will lead to exchanges that build the technical and personnel infrastructure necessary to perform the high-quality and sustainable cancer research desperately needed in Zambia.

To evaluate their potential for translation, we will integrate these dynamic models with clinical trials that will evaluate whether these phenotypic changes can be targeted for therapy. We hypothesize that acquired resistance emerges from selection acting on phenotypes during tumor evolution, and that simultaneously measuring and modeling subclone genotypes and phenotypes will identify new, and testable, therapeutic targets. Selective pressures from therapy and the tumor microenvironment can propel subclones from every patient's tumor along an evolutionary trajectory that leads to resistance. Indeed, our data shows that both genetic and phenotypic diversity among tumor subclones evolves as cancer cells progress to a resistant state. However, it is not yet known the specific phenotypes that promote that resistant state, the interactions among them, and how they converge to common resistant phenotypes seen in late stage cancer. To address these and other questions, we will develop a new class of dynamical systems models of subclone evolution to characterize the changes and development of key cell states that arise during acquired chemo-resistance and metastasis using our unique patient cohorts. These mechanistic models will identify points of therapeutic vulnerability that we will test in clinical trials aimed at blocking evolution to a resistant state by targeting critical resistant phenotypes. Our Center is comprised of an Administrative, Education/Outreach, Translational, and Computational Cores, in addition to two complementary projects. The synergies are derived from: 1) the convergent parameterization of the evolutionary models drawn from deep longitudinal patient progression studies (Project 1) and broad multisite metastatic tumor analyses (Project 2), resulting in a robust model to identify resistant states for clinical targeting; and 2) an integrated computational and experimental framework and resources for dissecting tumor heterogeneity and evolution that will contribute to an improved capacity for personalized cancer therapy. Our multidisciplinary team of systems biologists, bioinformaticians, tumor biologists, pharmacologists, mathematical biologists, and clinicians will tackle these scientific challenges. We will create programs to educate the next generation of scientists in systems biology and inform the community about the latest scientific advances and their impact on treatment strategies. And we will provide state of the art tools for the analysis of patient samples and tumor genomic complexity. These studies move beyond prior research by integrating cell population dynamics and cellular phenotypes with cellular genotypes, and will deliver approaches and a knowledge base to block or reverse the transition to a resistant state for advanced stage cancer patients. interact in the progression toward chemoresistant breast and ovarian cancer",Address;Behavior;Biological Models;Biological Pharmacology;Biological Process;Breast;Cancer Patient;Cells;Clinical;Clinical Treatment;Clinical Trials;Clonal Evolution;Clonality;Collection;Communities;Community Outreach;Complex;DNA;Data;Development;Drug Targeting;Drug resistance;Education and Outreach;Educational Activities;Evolution;Faculty;Generations;Genetic;Genetic Transcription;Genomics;Genotype;Goals;Heterogeneity;Individual;Institutes;Knowledge;Malignant Neoplasms;Malignant neoplasm of ovary;Mathematics;Measures;Methodology;Modeling;Mutation;Neoplasm Metastasis;Oncogenic;Ovarian;Pathway interactions;Patients;Pharmacology;Pharmacology Study;Pharmacotherapy;Phenotype;Population Dynamics;Population Heterogeneity;Postdoctoral Fellow;Prevention program;Refractory;Regimen;Research;Research Infrastructure;Research Project Grants;Resistance;Resources;Sampling;Science;Scientific Advances and Accomplishments;Scientist;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;Site;Solid;Somatic Mutation;System;Systems Analysis;Systems Biology;Testing;Therapeutic;Translations;Variant;base;cancer cell;cohort;combat;computerized tools;data sharing;dynamic system;effective therapy;experimental study;improved;innovation;knowledge base;malignant breast neoplasm;member;multidisciplinary;neoplastic cell;next generation;novel drug combination;outreach program;personalized cancer therapy;predictive modeling;pressure;prevent;programs;student training;synergism;targeted treatment;therapeutic target;tool;transcriptomics;treatment response;treatment strategy;tumor;tumor heterogeneity;tumor microenvironment,Andrea Hope Bild,Shannon K Hughes,474644,474644,2017-05-09T12:05:00Z,2017-05-15T12:05:00Z,2017-09-30T12:09:00Z,RFA-CA-15-014,nofo_RFA-CA-15-014,university of utah,SALT LAKE CITY,UT,UNITED STATES,csbc,org_name,True

These efforts have uncovered a staggering level of genome complexity in cancer. Although much is known about the function and clinical impact of recurrent aberrations in well-known cancer genes, less is known about which and how the more abundant, low-frequency mutations contribute to tumor progression. Effective translation of tumor genomic datasets into cancer therapeutics will require new experimental systems to inform the functional activity of targets in the relevant biological context encompassing inter- and intra-tumoral heterogeneity. To address these needs, we propose a CTD2 Center that will provide the research community high-throughput informatic and experimental approaches to characterize and validate pathogenic “driver” mutations and fusion genes as well as identify molecular markers that meaningfully predict responses or resistance to anticancer therapies. We will pursue the following Specific Aims: In Aim 1 we will implement an algorithmic framework for identifying driver mutations with high sensitivity and specificity. We will focus our algorithm development, training and testing efforts on predicting oncogenic, gain-of-function mutation drivers of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). These computational approaches will be amenable to the analysis of all cancer types. We will next engineer ~1,500 selected mutations and ~400 fusion genes into expression vectors along with cohorts of personalized, patient-defined coding mutations. In Aim 2 we will enter mutant alleles and fusion genes into GBM, PDAC and EOC context-specific, in vivo functional screens that take into account the importance of genetic context, tumor microenvironment and heterogeneity in the selection of single and combinatorial drivers of tumorigenesis. In Aim 3 we will determine the consequences of intra-tumoral heterogeneity on tumor sensitivity and resistance to therapeutic agents using DNA-barcoded, human patient-derived xenograft models that recapitulate the heterogeneity of cancer. We will determine the extent to which single targeted agents and their rational combinations alter tumor population dynamics. We will also leverage Aim 1 informatics and functional characterizations in Aim 2 and 4 to characterize “persistor” populations to identify aberrations associated with drug resistance. In Aim 4 we will use high-throughput functional proteomics, innovative protein- protein interaction assays and informer drug library screening studies to elucidate underlying mechanisms and therapeutic liabilities engendered by validated drivers.

1U01CA217883-01,U01CA217883,9363625,2017,Personalized cancer models to discover and develop new therapeutic targets.,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The wealth of data on the genomics of cancer provides a great opportunity to develop more effective targeted therapies. However, many commonly mutated cancer genes resist efforts to target with drugs, genetic heterogeneity of tumors confounds choice or efficacy of drugs, and development of resistance to commonly used therapies is common, leaving few alternatives. New approaches are needed to address these challenges. Exploiting cellular vulnerabilities generated as a result of mutations in commonly mutated genes, e.g. synthetic lethality, is a promising approach, as illustrated by the recent approval of the PARP inhibitor olaparib in ovarian cancer. We have developed and optimized a synthetic lethal discovery platform that entails high throughput screening to identify novel targets in patient-derived cancer cell cultures and isogenic cell systems. Integration of functional screen results with both patient specific (N of 1) and population-based genomic data is used to prioritize targets useful to the greatest number of patients and in the most appropriate genomic and molecular contexts. Prioritized targets undergo exhaustive confirmation and orthogonal validation in physiologically-relevant settings including genomically characterized patient-derived cell cultures, organoids and patient derived xenograft (PDX) models. Synthetic lethal genes identified with our platform are conserved across species, have been confirmed as candidate drug targets across multiple human cancer types and have led to an investigator initiated clinical trial, illustrating the translational utility of our platform. The outcome of this proposal will be novel validated targets and therapeutic strategies to several human cancer types including those resistant to standard of care agents and a deeper understanding of the biology of several major cancer genes.",Address;Affect;Autologous;Biochemical;Bioinformatics;Biological Assay;Biological Markers;Biology;Biopsy;Cancer Biology;Cancer Model;Cell Culture Techniques;Cells;Clinical;Clinical Oncology;Clinical Trials;Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats;Complex;Computational Biology;DNA sequencing;Data;Data Set;Development;Drug Combinations;Drug Targeting;Drug resistance;Event;Future;Gene Targeting;Genes;Genetic;Genetic Heterogeneity;Genome;Genomics;Genotype;Goals;Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma;Human;Imagery;Immunotherapy;KRAS2 gene;Knock-out;Lethal Genes;Malignant Neoplasms;Malignant neoplasm of ovary;Methods;Modeling;Molecular;Mutate;Mutation;Neoadjuvant Therapy;Oncogenes;Operative Surgical Procedures;Organoids;Outcome;Outcomes Research;Patient Representative;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phenotype;Physiological;Predictive Value;Research Personnel;Resistance;Resistance development;Screening Result;Small Interfering RNA;Solid Neoplasm;Surgical Oncology;System;TP53 gene;Test Result;Testing;Therapeutic Agents;Translations;Tumor-Derived;Validation;Work;Xenograft Model;cancer cell;cancer genomics;cancer type;drug candidate;drug development;drug discovery;drug efficacy;exhaustion;gene function;genomic aberrations;genomic data;high throughput screening;inhibitor/antagonist;innovation;insight;molecular subtypes;mouse model;mutant;neoplastic cell;new therapeutic target;novel;novel strategies;novel therapeutics;oncology;population based;pre-clinical;precision medicine;precision oncology;preclinical development;predictive modeling;profiles in patients;resistance mechanism;response;screening;small hairpin RNA;small molecule inhibitor;standard of care;statistics;success;targeted agent;targeted cancer therapy;targeted treatment;tool;tumor;tumor heterogeneity,Christopher J Kemp,Daniela Gerhard,902672,902672,2017-09-14T12:09:00Z,2017-09-14T12:09:00Z,2022-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-16-014,nofo_RFA-CA-16-014,fred hutchinson cancer research center,SEATTLE,WA,UNITED STATES,ctd_2,org_name,False

These efforts have uncovered a staggering level of genome complexity in cancer. Although much is known about the function and clinical impact of recurrent aberrations in well-known cancer genes, less is known about which and how the more abundant, low-frequency mutations contribute to tumor progression. Effective translation of tumor genomic datasets into cancer therapeutics will require new experimental systems to inform the functional activity of targets in the relevant biological context encompassing inter- and intra-tumoral heterogeneity. To address these needs, we propose a CTD2 Center that will provide the research community high-throughput informatic and experimental approaches to characterize and validate pathogenic “driver” mutations and fusion genes as well as identify molecular markers that meaningfully predict responses or resistance to anticancer therapies. We will pursue the following Specific Aims: In Aim 1 we will implement an algorithmic framework for identifying driver mutations with high sensitivity and specificity. We will focus our algorithm development, training and testing efforts on predicting oncogenic, gain-of-function mutation drivers of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC).

1U01CA274970-01,U01CA274970,10538749,2022,Precision Clinical Trial Recruitment to Promote Cancer Health Equity Across Florida,"PROJECT SUMMARY Racial and ethnic minorities represent the fastest growing segment of the United States adult population, yet they remain significantly underrepresented in cancer clinical trials (CCTs). Low trust in clinical research and recruitment approaches that fail to address multilevel barriers to CCT participation are key reasons for minority population underrepresentation. Community health educators (CHEs) improve trust in research among underrepresented populations, yet relying on exclusively on CHE availability can limit intervention reach. Virtual CHEs (vCHEs) improve scalability by extending CHE capabilities and capitalizing on remote recruitment techniques. The purpose of the current project is to increase referral of diverse participants to NCI-supported clinical trials via a culturally responsive, multi-level intervention that utilizes vCHEs to reach diverse populations. We will consolidate existing referral channels within the ALEX Research Portal. ALEX offers a custom experience for clinicians, CHEs, and patients to facilitate CCT referrals. Clinicians can utilize the portal to refer to CCTs; CHEs can use the portal to create an avatar that can provide introductory information to patients and schedule video-conference follow-ups; patients, families, and community members can use the portal to easily navigate to key information and make self- and other-referrals. The ability to streamline information to patients and CCT referrals to study coordinators is expected to improve the overall referral to CCTs. The ALEX Research Portal utilizes the adaptive virtual human technology developed at the University of Florida that provides users with culturally and linguistically tailored CCT information. The ALEX Research Portal will be developed and launched across three distinct geographic areas of Florida (Gainesville, Jacksonville, and Miami). This unique collaborative opportunity will provide access to participants representative of the racial and ethnic diversity of the state as well as cancer centers conducting CCTs associated with national networks (ETCTN, NCTN). Guided by the Interactive Systems Framework for dissemination and implementation, our goal is to increase referrals to CCTs by optimizing the ALEX Research Portal for broad use.

5U01CA274970-04,U01CA274970,10912491,2024,Precision Clinical Trial Recruitment to Promote Cancer Health Equity Across Florida,"PROJECT SUMMARY Racial and ethnic minorities represent the fastest growing segment of the United States adult population, yet they remain significantly underrepresented in cancer clinical trials (CCTs). Low trust in clinical research and recruitment approaches that fail to address multilevel barriers to CCT participation are key reasons for minority population underrepresentation. Community health educators (CHEs) improve trust in research among underrepresented populations, yet relying on exclusively on CHE availability can limit intervention reach. Virtual CHEs (vCHEs) improve scalability by extending CHE capabilities and capitalizing on remote recruitment techniques. The purpose of the current project is to increase referral of diverse participants to NCI-supported clinical trials via a culturally responsive, multi-level intervention that utilizes vCHEs to reach diverse populations. We will consolidate existing referral channels within the ALEX Research Portal. ALEX offers a custom experience for clinicians, CHEs, and patients to facilitate CCT referrals. Clinicians can utilize the portal to refer to CCTs; CHEs can use the portal to create an avatar that can provide introductory information to patients and schedule video-conference follow-ups; patients, families, and community members can use the portal to easily navigate to key information and make self- and other-referrals. The ability to streamline information to patients and CCT referrals to study coordinators is expected to improve the overall referral to CCTs. The ALEX Research Portal utilizes the adaptive virtual human technology developed at the University of Florida that provides users with culturally and linguistically tailored CCT information. The ALEX Research Portal will be developed and launched across three distinct geographic areas of Florida (Gainesville, Jacksonville, and Miami). This unique collaborative opportunity will provide access to participants representative of the racial and ethnic diversity of the state as well as cancer centers conducting CCTs associated with national networks (ETCTN, NCTN). Guided by the Interactive Systems Framework for dissemination and implementation, our goal is to increase referrals to CCTs by optimizing the ALEX Research Portal for broad use. The outcome will be an evidence-based intervention that can be widely disseminated to quickly increase the referral of diverse patients to CCTs. This project will be conducted in three phases: (Phase I) establish a baseline of referrals and accrual of diverse participants to CCTs across multiple Florida Center Centers, (Phase 2) adapt and pilot the ALEX Research Portal using a randomized controlled clinical trial, and (Phase 3) scale the intervention by dissemination via the OneFlorida network.

Given the increasing median age of the US population, the number of breast cancers diagnosed in older women is expected to rise by 50% in the coming decades. Older women with breast cancer experience worse breast cancer-specific outcomes as compared to younger women, under-treatment is likely to play a central role. Studies have demonstrated that breast cancer patients who receive <85% of received dose intensity (RDI), a metric that combines the total dose administered with adherence to the planned treatment schedule, have a 57% increase in the risk of disease recurrence at 10 years as compared to women who receive at least 85% RDI. Only 50-76% of breast cancer patients >65 receive an RDI >85, largely due to increased toxicity of therapy in these patients. Reducing treatment-related toxicity to enhance RDI is critical to improving disease outcomes among the growing population of older breast cancer patients. To this end, models predicting for severe chemotoxicity demonstrate that a number of potentially modifiable factors (commonly assessed as part of the geriatric assessment), are important determinants of chemotoxicity, including function, depression, and falls (or use of assistive devices). Exercise has a significant positive impact on each of these modifiable factors, in the general population and in cancer patients. However, data on the ability of exercise interventions to improve treatment tolerance and preserve dose intensity among older breast cancer patients are lacking. We propose a randomized controlled trial to assess the effects of a multicomponent, hybrid telehealth (TH) exercise and protein intake support (the THRIVE Intervention) on RDI, incidence and severity of chemotoxicities, functional status, muscle mass, and patient reported outcomes in 270 breast cancer patients age ≥ 65 receiving neo/adjuvant chemotherapy. Participants will be randomized to the THRIVE Intervention or to a Health Education and Support control group. The intervention will be delivered through a hybrid model, leveraging the existing Breast Cancer Weight Loss (BWEL) Trial call center. After 2 in-person, onsite exercise sessions, we will transition to TH sessions delivered on study provided tablets, by certified exercise coaches who will tailor behavior change to support adherence relative to symptom burden. To optimize intervention effectiveness, participants will undergo a TH evaluation of diet adequacy with a registered dietitian, focused on optimal daily protein intake.

1U01CA132194-01,U01CA132194,7391358,2008,Early Clinical Trials of New Anti-Cancer Agents with Phase I Emphasis (U01),"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this application is to develop and perform early clinical trials with new anti-cancer agents sponsored by the NCI Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program. Discovery and clinical evaluation of new anti- cancer agents is one of the highest strategic objectives of the Cancer Institute of New Jersey (CINJ), the only NCI-designated comprehensive cancer center in New Jersey. From its inception, CINJ has focused on development of early clinical trials with a translational emphasis. CINJ clinical investigators have an outstanding record of translational clinical trial development, including pharmacokinetic/biomarker studies in several phase I/pilot trials supported by grants from the NCI. This expertise encompasses a wide range of drug targets, including cellular signaling pathways as well as novel immunologic, DNA-, and microtubule- associated targets. From 2004-2006, 42 phase I or pilot trials were active at CINJ, with an average annual accrual of 151 patients to these trials. Scientific themes within these studies included statistically driven dose- and schedule-finding algorithms, as well as validation of target modulation by biochemical studies of cancer tissues. CINJ provides an exceptional and unique resource for early clinical trials of new anti-cancer agents. Expected to reach a population of 9,000,000 by 2008, New Jersey has the highest population density in the United States, with an average of 1,174 people per square mile, which is 13 times the national average. Approximately 70,000 patient visits occur yearly at the main CINJ facility, and over 6000 new patients are seen each year. A statewide network of affiliated institutions facilitates referral for early clinical trials. CINJ has an outstanding clinical research infrastructure provided by several Shared Resources, including Biometrics, Centralized Education and Training Services for Clinical Research Personnel, Office of Human Research Services, Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics, Research Pharmacy, and Tissue Retrieval Services. Clinical informatics resources include electronic order entry, electronic clinical documentation, and a web-based clinical trials database that allows online monitoring of trial development, accrual, adverse events, and responses, as well as electronic data sharing with NCI trial monitoring systems.",Adverse event;Algorithms;Antineoplastic Agents;Biochemical;Biological Markers;Biometry;Cancer Institute of New Jersey;Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program;Clinical;Clinical Informatics;Clinical Investigator;Clinical Research;Clinical Trials;Clinical Trials Database;Comprehensive Cancer Center;DNA;Data;Development;Documentation;Dose;Drug Delivery Systems;Drug Kinetics;Electronics;Goals;Grant;Health Services Research;Human;Immunologics;Institution;Malignant Neoplasms;Microtubules;Monitor;New Jersey;Online Systems;Patients;Pharmacodynamics;Pharmacy facility;Phase;Population;Population Density;Range;Research;Research Infrastructure;Research Personnel;Resource Informatics;Resource Sharing;Resources;Retrieval;Schedule;Services;Signal Pathway;System;Time;Tissues;Training and Education;United States;Validation;Visit;novel;pilot trial;research clinical testing;response;translational clinical trial,Robert S.

2U01CA069853-09,U01CA069853,6581582,2003,Phase I Clinical Trials of Anti-Cancer Agents,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal entitled, ""Phase I Clinical Trials of Anti-Cancer Agents,"" prepared in response to RFA No. CA-02-011, requests support for early stage clinical evaluations, particularly phase I, pharmacological and relevant biological studies, of investigational anti-cancer therapeutics. The greatest advances in the cancer therapy have resulted from the introduction of novel anti-cancer therapeutics and their subsequent optimization (i.e. dosing, scheduling, sequencing, deployment in combination) for clinical practice. The phase I stage represents a crucial step in this developmental process, and the reliability of clinical and supportive pharmacological and biological data may significantly impact on the expedient and optimal development of new therapies. This is especially true for selective rationally-designed, target-based agents. The sheer number investigational candidates is striking relative to available developmental resources, and prioritization of these resources by considering the ultimate impact of the therapeutic represent major developmental challenges that must be overcome. Furthermore, unlike nonspecific cytotoxics, in which anti-cancer activity is often dose-related and, hence, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is generally sought, the preponderance of preclinical data with selective target-based therapeutics suggest that maximal biological effects will occur at doses that are substantially lower than the MTD. Selection of a maximal biological dose would likely result in greater therapeutic indices and more ""breathing room"" for combination development. The preponderance of preclinical data also suggests that the predominant beneficial effects of target-based therapeutics will be tumor growth inhibition, which may not be appreciated in nonrandomized studies. This proposal will describe the San Antonio Drug Development Group's (SADDG) approach to meet these challenges. The specific aims are directed at discerning both traditional phase I study endpoints (e.g. MTD, characterization of toxicity) and relevant biological and pharmacological endpoints (e.g. maximally effective dose.) The latter is particularly important in view of the expectations that many novel anti-cancer agents may not have clear toxicological endpoints, and the prospects for clinical utility may not be known until further evaluations have been completed. Therefore, other specific aims, including the assessment of relevant biological activity at the target level, are of utmost importance to ultimately optimize the therapeutic indices of investigational cancer therapies. The SADDG proposes to perform rigorous and comprehensive toxicological, pharmacological, and biological evaluations in the course of early clinical trials. The results will be synthesized to address therapeutic optimization issues, ascertain proof of principle, and develop assays to discern the relevant effects of the therapy on the target.

The greatest advances in the cancer therapy have resulted from the introduction of novel anti-cancer therapeutics and their subsequent optimization (i.e. dosing, scheduling, sequencing, deployment in combination) for clinical practice. The phase I stage represents a crucial step in this developmental process, and the reliability of clinical and supportive pharmacological and biological data may significantly impact on the expedient and optimal development of new therapies. This is especially true for selective rationally-designed, target-based agents. The sheer number investigational candidates is striking relative to available developmental resources, and prioritization of these resources by considering the ultimate impact of the therapeutic represent major developmental challenges that must be overcome. Furthermore, unlike nonspecific cytotoxics, in which anti-cancer activity is often dose-related and, hence, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is generally sought, the preponderance of preclinical data with selective target-based therapeutics suggest that maximal biological effects will occur at doses that are substantially lower than the MTD. Selection of a maximal biological dose would likely result in greater therapeutic indices and more ""breathing room"" for combination development. The preponderance of preclinical data also suggests that the predominant beneficial effects of target-based therapeutics will be tumor growth inhibition, which may not be appreciated in nonrandomized studies. This proposal will describe the San Antonio Drug Development Group's (SADDG) approach to meet these challenges. The specific aims are directed at discerning both traditional phase I study endpoints (e.g. MTD, characterization of toxicity) and relevant biological and pharmacological endpoints (e.g. maximally effective dose.) The latter is particularly important in view of the expectations that many novel anti-cancer agents may not have clear toxicological endpoints, and the prospects for clinical utility may not be known until further evaluations have been completed. Therefore, other specific aims, including the assessment of relevant biological activity at the target level, are of utmost importance to ultimately optimize the therapeutic indices of investigational cancer therapies. The SADDG proposes to perform rigorous and comprehensive toxicological, pharmacological, and biological evaluations in the course of early clinical trials. The results will be synthesized to address therapeutic optimization issues, ascertain proof of principle, and develop assays to discern the relevant effects of the therapy on the target. The development of such assays may be even more crucial for subsequent disease-directed studies to gauge biological targeting and/or tumor growth inhibition in vivo.

Discovery and clinical evaluation of new anti- cancer agents is one of the highest strategic objectives of the Cancer Institute of New Jersey (CINJ), the only NCI-designated comprehensive cancer center in New Jersey. From its inception, CINJ has focused on development of early clinical trials with a translational emphasis. CINJ clinical investigators have an outstanding record of translational clinical trial development, including pharmacokinetic/biomarker studies in several phase I/pilot trials supported by grants from the NCI. This expertise encompasses a wide range of drug targets, including cellular signaling pathways as well as novel immunologic, DNA-, and microtubule- associated targets. From 2004-2006, 42 phase I or pilot trials were active at CINJ, with an average annual accrual of 151 patients to these trials. Scientific themes within these studies included statistically driven dose- and schedule-finding algorithms, as well as validation of target modulation by biochemical studies of cancer tissues. CINJ provides an exceptional and unique resource for early clinical trials of new anti-cancer agents. Expected to reach a population of 9,000,000 by 2008, New Jersey has the highest population density in the United States, with an average of 1,174 people per square mile, which is 13 times the national average. Approximately 70,000 patient visits occur yearly at the main CINJ facility, and over 6000 new patients are seen each year.

1U24CA210952-01,U24CA210952,9210297,2016,Integrative miRNA data analysis for clinical cancer genomics,"PROJECT SUMMARY The proposed research has two broad, long-term objectives. First, it seeks to shift medical practice toward more personalized treatments, by applying innovative methods to analyze and integrate DNA, RNA and protein data generated by a large network of GDAN researchers in a miRNA-centric framework. Analyses will identify cancer subtypes, and individual patients within a subtype, in which alterations in the expression of certain miRNAs influence cancer pathogenesis and drug response. Second, the proposed research seeks to shift cancer genomics research by allowing a diverse group of cancer researchers to flexibly access and use the project’s cancer genomics data, and microRNA-centric results and methods, through a cloud computing framework. The proposed research has three specific aims: 1) Build a computational pipeline for processing and analysis of miRNA data, 2) Elucidate the regulation of and by miRNAs through integrative analysis, and 3) Delineate the role of miRNAs in cancer progression and treatment using predictive modeling. Research design and methods: 1) Processing and analysis of miRNA data. We will process total RNA sequence data to identify expressed miRNAs, and extend the current processing pipeline to identify potentially functional miRNA sequence variants. We will apply our miRNA-centric analyses developed for The Cancer Genome Atlas project to identify: subtypes within a cancer, miRNAs that are associated with survival, miRNA targeting effects on gene and protein expression, and cis-effects of copy number and DNA methylation on miRNA abundances. 2) Regulation of and by miRNAs. Collaborating within the research network, we will extend our analysis methods to take into account additional datatypes and functional contexts that influence how miRNAs are regulated, and how they regulate genes and their products. 3) Predictive modeling. As the research network will have detailed clinical data and multiplatform genomic data, we will apply machine learning algorithms in a novel context to key sets of genes, proteins and miRNAs that predict clinical outcomes like survival and drug response. 4) Cloud computing.

1R21CA083232-01A1,R21CA083232,6130434,2000,APTAMER BASED DETECTOR TO QUANTIFY MACROMOLECULES,"DESCRIPTION: (Applicant's Description) We propose to develop a technology to simultaneously detect and quantify large numbers individual proteins and post-translationally modified proteins. This technology will be based on a spatially-arrayed aptamer microchip and sensitive fluorescence-based optical detection techniques. The system will provide a powerful new tool for biomedical research and diagnosis of diseases and cancers. Currently, the levels of cellular proteins are inferred from cellular mRNA levels by using DNA oligonucleotide microchips. These microchips allow the detection of mRNA levels by base-pairing interactions to homologous DNA oligomers located at different sites in the microchip array. However, this indirect assay of protein levels suffers from two problems: First, mRNA levels may not accurately reflect the level of encoded protein because translation and degradation rates vary from protein to protein and are regulated in response to cell physiology. Second, post-translational modifications proteins often alter critical protein activities. This technology we propose to develop is comprised of three parts: 1) Aptamers with high-affinity and high-specifity for individual proteins. These aptamers will be designed to have ligand-dependent changes in fluorescence properties. 2) A microchip array with each array site occupied by aptamers against a different target molecule. 3) An evanescent field fluorescence detector which detects target molecules binding to aptamers at the array sites. Our proposal includes plans for: 1) selection of aptamers that can discriminate between different post-translational modifications of the same protein; 2) development of fluorescence-based techniques for detecting oligonucleotide:protein interactions; 3) design and construction of an optimized fluorescence detector; 4) scaling up methods to allow large numbers of independent aptamer selections against different proteins; 5) construction of a prototype protein chip.",macromolecule; messenger RNA; microprocessor /microchip; oligonucleotides; posttranslational modifications; proteins; technology /technique development,Martin J Stanton,Daniel L.

1R21CA112149-01,R21CA112149,6861456,2005,Automated Cell Preparation in Tubes for 3D Microscopy,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): 3D microscopy represents a powerful new cell analysis tool for early detection and diagnosis of cancer, but its future use may be limited because methods for preparation of samples are cumbersome, inefficient, labor intensive and generally imprecise. Current methods for cytological sample collection are manual and distributed in nature through various physicians' office laboratories and local hospitals, with the actual analysis being centralized at regional clinical laboratories. Among the cytological specimens are sputum, gynecological and colorectal scrapes, fine needle aspirates, urinary tract, and gastrointestinal samples. We propose the development of a new automated system that will transform these difficult and messy clinical specimens into an optimal format for 3D microscopy morphological and molecular analysis. The model and method we propose is comprised of three sequential steps. First, at the distributed site, an automated sample processor dissociates and fixes cells and debris for shipment in an automation compatible canister. Second, after shipment to a centralized clinical laboratory, the specimen canisters are loaded into an automatic processor that performs cleanup (debris removal), specimen/assay specific staining (and counterstaining), and finally embedding of cells of interest in glass microcapillary tubes (about 50 mu m ID), with cells being spaced at regular intervals (about 200 mu m) within a tube. This preparation format is uniquely suited for integration with multiple 3D imaging platforms for true 3D volumetric assessment of cell morphology and molecular probe and/or stain density distribution. The proposed system also enables use of cytometric flow sorting for enrichment of cells of interest at an intermediate stage of the sample preparation process. The potential impact to improved human health through rapid diagnostic screening will be illustrated using a high impact emerging technology, optical tomography. In summary, the aim of the proposed project is to develop, design, and build a complete sample processing system that automates the process of sample cleanup, assay specific staining, and mounting of cells into glass microcapillary tubes, and a tube positioning and rotation scanner mechanism for 3D microscopy analysis of cell morphology for the early detection of cancer.",bioimaging /biomedical imaging;biomedical automation;cell morphology;clinical research;cytodiagnosis;early diagnosis;flow cytometry;high throughput technology;human tissue;molecular probes;neoplasm /cancer diagnosis;technology /technique development;three dimensional imaging /topography;tissue /cell preparation,Deirdre R.

The assay proposed relies on an electro catalytic process involving two transition-metal ions that reports on biomolecular complexation events. Because the reporter system responds to changes in the electrostatics of an electrode surface, it will enable the analysis of nucleic acids/protein and peptide/protein complexes. The proposed project has 3 specific aims: 1) electro catalytic detection of DNA repair proteins implicated in cancer using DNA-modified electrodes; 2) optimization of electro catalytic detection and multiplexed analysis of cellular DNA repair activities, and 3) development of a generalized electro catalytic protein detection method using prostate cancer biomarkers. The electro catalytic protein detection system described is advantageous because it will allow the analysis and discrimination of multiprotein complexes in addition to uncomplexed analytes and will have high selectivity and specificity. Additionally, the protein detection assays will be conducted using nanoelectrodes that will allow multiplexed detection of panels of different biomolecular targets.",DNA binding protein;DNA repair;biomarker;biotechnology;carbonates;electrochemistry;electrodes;high throughput technology;nanotechnology;oligonucleotides;prostate neoplasms;prostate specific antigen;protein quantitation /detection;synthetic nucleotide;technology /technique development,Shana O Kelley,John R Knowlton,154500,154500,2005-06-21T12:06:00Z,2005-06-21T12:06:00Z,2007-05-31T12:05:00Z,RFA-CA-05-002,nofo_RFA-CA-05-002,boston college,CHESTNUT HILL,MA,UNITED STATES,imat,org_name,False
1R21CA114852-01,R21CA114852,6913103,2005,Profile serum proteins by glycopeptide capture and LC-MS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancers develop over a period of several years and they are characterized by molecular changes prior to invasion and metastasis. Development of a technology that enables screening of cancer from body fluids could permit cancer detection at early and treatable stages. It is expected that the composition of the serum proteome contains valuable information about the state of the human body in health and disease, and that this information can be extracted via quantitative proteomic measurements. Suitable proteomic techniques need to be sensitive, reproducible and robust, to detect potential biomarkers below the level of highly expressed proteins, to generate data sets that are comparable between experiments and laboratories, and have high throughput to support studies with sufficient statistical power. In this proposal, we will develop a method for high throughput quantitative analysis of serum proteins. It consists of the selective isolation of the peptides that are N-linked glycosylated in the intact protein using solid-phase extraction of glycopeptides (SPEG) on a robotic workstation, the analysis of these now de-glycosylated peptides by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS), and the comparative analysis of the resulting patterns. By focusing selectively on a few formerly N-linked glycopeptides per serum protein, the complexity of the analyte sample is significantly reduced, and the sensitivity, reproducibility, and throughput of serum proteome analysis are increased compared with the analysis of total tryptic peptides from unfractionated samples. We will explore the feasibility to identify cancer-specific serum proteins in the background of normal variation using a carcinogen-induced skin cancer mouse model. The specific aims are: 1) To develop chemistries and protocols for an automatic robotic system to isolate N-linked glycopeptides from serum in a high throughput and highly reproducible fashion; 2) To develop efficient and reproducible procedures for LC-MS analyses, and sequence identification of discriminatory peptides by tandem mass spectrometry; 3) To explore the feasibility of this method for the identification of distinctive serum peptides specific to cancer-bearing mice in the background of normal variations. If successful, the proposed research could subsequently be used for profiling human serum samples from cancer patients and normal individuals to identify the cancer-associated proteins in serum. The identified biomarkers will open a new paradigm for performing screening and detection of human cancer at early stage and for clinical therapeutic management.",biomarker;biomedical automation;biotechnology;blood proteins;glycopeptides;high throughput technology;laboratory mouse;liquid chromatography mass spectrometry;neoplasm /cancer diagnosis;proteomics;technology /technique development,Hui Zhang,John R Knowlton,167650,167650,2005-06-13T12:06:00Z,2005-06-13T12:06:00Z,2007-05-31T12:05:00Z,RFA-CA-05-002,nofo_RFA-CA-05-002,institute for systems biology,SEATTLE,WA,UNITED STATES,imat,org_name,False
1R21CA116060-01,R21CA116060,6962117,2005,REVERSIBLE PROMOTER-INSERTION FOR IN VIVO STUDIES OF MELANOMA,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is commonly accepted that the processes underlying the development of cancer are best modeled in vivo. A plethora of methods have been developed for genetic dissection of biological processes in somatic cells in culture; however, the adaptation of these techniques to in vivo use has been very limited. Our earlier experience indicates that reversible promoter-insertion mutagenesis offers a number of advantages over the currently used forward genetics techniques for cultured cells. The most important benefits are the dominant nature of the mutations, and the ease of identifying the affected gene and establishing the causal link between the mutation and the phenotype. The principal limitation for the adaptation of this technique to in vivo studies is the delivery of the insertional mutagen (typically, a retroviral vector) to the desired cell type. Based on our recent experience and published data from others, we propose a method to circumvent this limitation via the use of specially engineered transposon vectors. We propose to apply our technique to study the genetic events underlying melanoma development. We will screen for genetic events that cooperate with oncogenic Ras (commonly found in melanomas) in this process. We will confirm the properties of the proposed insertional mutagens in culture and then proceed to establish mouse strains suitable for mutagenesis. Upon verifying the properties of our constructs in vivo, we will selectively mutagenize melanocytes in transgenic animals and will test the functional link between tumorigenesis and the inserted promoter. Confirmed hits will be the subject of future investigation, while the technique itself will become available for dissection of various biological phenomena in general and aspects of tumorigenesis, in particular.",biomarker;biotechnology;cell line;gene mutation;genetically modified animals;guanine nucleotide binding protein;laboratory mouse;melanocyte;melanoma;neoplasm /cancer genetics;oncogenes;technology /technique development;tetracyclines;tissue /cell culture;transfection /expression vector;transposon /insertion element,Eugene S Kandel,Jennifer A.

1R21CA118632-01A2,R21CA118632,7238922,2007,Defining the Multiple Myeloma Kinome,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gene profiling technology has enabled analysis of the transcriptome and proteome of tumor cells. This information has provided useful information with regard to molecular mechanisms that define the enhanced survival and proliferation of MM cells. However, an equally, if not more important, goal is to define those proteins that participate in signaling pathways active in MM cells and their supporting stroma. Enzymes that phosphorylate tyrosine, serins and threonine residues on other proteins play a major role in signaling cascades that determine cell cycle entry and survival in MM and the stromal cells that support them. In particular, knowing the signaling pathways that are active in MM cells and their supporting stroma will provide critical information for understanding MM cell survival in the BM. We have developed and are applying to purified cells a novel array-based strategy that allows the simultaneous detection of phosphorylation for 1152 different kinase substrates. Here we propose to apply this emerging technology to the analysis of phosphorylation-based cell signaling pathways in MM and their supporting stroma. This R21/R33 Phased Innovation application will be pursued in two phases. In the R21 phase of this application Aims 1 and 2 will validate that PepChip technology can be applied to MM cells and their microenvironment to reveal signaling alterations in MM. In Aim 3 of the R33 phase we will use PepChip technology to identify kinome alterations within the MM patient population that are correlated with clinical parameters such as relapse and chromosomal abnormalities associated with poor prognosis. In Aim 4 we will utilize an in vivo model that supports the growth of primary patient isolates in RAG2XGammaC mice to determine the effect of therapeutics on the kinome of MM cells. This study will be pursued in the following.phased R21/R33 format: R21 Phase: Aim 1: Define the kinome of MM cells and normal plasma cells.

1R21CA123018-01,R21CA123018,7136805,2006,Epigenetic Targeting in Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hypermethylation of promoter CpG islands plays a prominent role in cancer. In partnership with alterations in histone acetylation/methylation, this epigenetic event establishes a repressive chromatin structure that leads to silencing of key cancer-related genes. The occurrence of DNA methylation within the genome is not random, but rather patterns of methylation are generated that are gene and tumor type specific. How DNA methylation patterns are established is still poorly understood. Since various transcriptional factors or regulators are found in association with DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) in vivo, we hypothesize that: 1) Oncogenic transcription factors can recruit DNMTs to target gene promoters and define a unique epigenetic signature in tumor cells; 2) Dissecting such complex epigenetic hierarchy will identify novel molecular targets for diagnosis, prognosis and therapeutic intervention. To test our hypothesis, we developed a high throughput technique for genome wide analysis of DNA methylation associated with specific proteins such as histones, transcription factors or any DNA binding proteins. The new approach named ChlP-Chop-DMH will combine both genome wide location analysis (also known as ChlP-on-Chip) and Differential Methylation Hybridization (DMH) analysis, two emerging technologies used in epigenetic research. The proposed method has distinct advantages over current protocols: first, this method directly examines the in vivo interaction of specific proteins with methylated DNA throughout the genome; second, this method may uncover novel biological properties of transcription factors; third, this method can be applied to discover novel epigenetic biomarkers relevant to tumorigenesis. In preliminary studies, we have verified the utility of this method with methylated histone H3 at lysine 9 and lysine 4 in human cancer cells. In the R21 phase, we will continue minor refinement of the method and pursue three aims: 1) Improve and optimize the ChlP-Chop-DMH method for analyzing genome wide association of DNA methylation with histone modification; 2) Utilize the proposed method to investigate the association of DNA methylation with chromatin remodeling factors: 3) Show proof-of-concept using the array to examine primary non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHLs). In this development phase we will focus on the sensitivity, reproducibility and accuracy of the proposed method. In the R33 phase, our goal is to utilize the technology to test biological hypotheses. We will fully implement the method and pursue these aims: 1) Discover epigenetic target genes associated with known oncogenic transcription factors c-Myc and BCL6: 2) Validate the identified epigenetic targets and investigate the regulatory role of the associated oncogenic transcription factors.

1R21CA125398-01A1,R21CA125398,7291241,2007,The Kinomes of Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gene profiling technology has enabled analysis of the transcriptome and proteome of tumor cells. In fact, massively parallel analysis of the Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) transcriptome has revealed discrete gene profile signatures for the major subtypes of NHL, diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and follicular lymphoma (FL). This information has provided useful insights into molecular mechanisms that promote enhanced survival and proliferation in NHL. However, an equally, if not more important goal, is to define those proteins that participate in signaling pathways active in lymphoma cells and non-malignant cells that infiltrate these tumors. Enzymes that phosphorylate tyrosine, serine and threonine residues on other proteins play a major role in signaling cascades that control cell cycle entry, survival, angiogenesis and the immune response. Defining how these signaling pathways are altered in NHL B cells and non- malignant cells present in these tumors will provide critical information for understanding how lymphoma survives, proliferates and interacts with other cells at the tumor site. We are applying to purified tumor cells a novel array strategy that allows the simultaneous detection of phosphorylation for 1152 different kinase substrates. Here we propose to apply this emerging technology to the analysis of phosphorylation-based cell signaling pathways in NHL. This proposal will be pursued in two phases. The R21 phase will consist of two aims that will validate PepChip technology can identify kinome alterations in primary DLBCL (Aim 1) and FL (Aim 2) isolates. The R33 phase will consist of two aims that will define kinome alterations in DLBCL (Aim 3) and FL (Aim 4) that correlate with clinical parameters. In Aim 5 we will utilize in vivo models of FL and DLBCL to determine whether inhibitors specific for deregulated kinases inhibit growth of NHL tumors in immunodeficient mice. This study will be pursued in the following phased R21/R33 format: R21 Phase: Aim 1: Define the kinome of DLBCL B cells and non-malignant cells present in these tumors. Aim 2: Define the kinome of FL B cells and non-malignant cells present in these tumors. Aim 3: Identify kinome alterations in DLBCL correlated with clinical parameters of disease.

1R21CA132806-01,R21CA132806,7434635,2008,Standardized NanoArray PCR for Gene Expression Profiling of Lung Cancer,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Molecular characterization of cancer, in particular by gene transcription profiling, has great potential to improve prognosis, therapeutic selection and clinical outcomes. However, the potential for using expression signatures for cancer prognosis and treatment selection is hampered by lack of readily deployable test kits with the accuracy, low RNA requirement and inter-site concordance required for routine clinical use. We propose an innovative solution based on two well-validated PCR technologies whose combination uniquely addresses the problem of diagnostic assay reproducibility. Our plan is to implement Standardized RT (StaRT)-PCR, a proven competitive PCR method developed at the University of Toledo, in a novel nanofluidic PCR platform developed by BioTrove Inc. in order to streamline the fluidic workflow, improve measurement throughput, and at the same time reduce test cost and maintain low RNA input. As compared to existing hybridization or real-time qPCR approaches, Standardized NanoArray PCR (SNAP) will provide the same dynamic range and quality as RT-PCR, yet require less RNA input and be more readily clinically deployable. The development will entail step-wise integration of proven technologies. First, real-time qPCR TaqMan assays will be developed for 16 lung tumor prognostic genes. These assays will be converted to StaRT-PCR by creation of competitive template and a competitor specific dye-labeled probe. Adding a pre-amplification step to StaRT-PCR will reduce the RNA input requirements to enable thousands of tests per sample. Finally, moving the assays into the OpenArray nano-PCR plate will streamline fluid handling. Using RNA isolated from lung clinical tumor resections, dynamic range and precision equivalent to real-time qPCR will be demonstrated for the integrated platform. After the initial development phase is complete, we will compare SNAP and real time qPCR in two critical gene expression profiling experiments. First we will compare the minimum amount of RNA required for each method by monitoring loss of precision as a function of decreasing RNA sample input. Second we will demonstrate lower inter-site variability, a critical factor for deploy-ability, by measuring gene expression profiles of seven lung tumor resection samples in three laboratories. Meeting these Specific Aims will lead to seeking further funding for multi-site prognostic validation studies involving formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) lung specimens with extensive clinical history.",Address;Adoption;Biological Assay;Cancer Prognosis;Characteristics;Chemistry;Class;Clinical;Color;Consumption;Detection;Development;Diagnostic;Diagnostic Procedure;Diagnostic tests;Dyes;End Point;End Point Assay;Excision;Formalin;Freezing;Funding;Gene Expression;Gene Expression Profile;Gene Expression Profiling;Genes;Genetic Transcription;Genomics;Goals;Health;Label;Laboratories;Lead;Liquid substance;Lung;Lung Neoplasms;Malignant Neoplasms;Malignant neoplasm of lung;Measurement;Measures;Methods;Molecular;Molecular Diagnostic Testing;Molecular Profiling;Monitor;Morphologic artifacts;Nanoarray Analytical Device;Numbers;Operative Surgical Procedures;Outcome;Paraffin Embedding;Performance;Phase;Pliability;Polymerase Chain Reaction;Quality Control;RNA;Range;Recording of previous events;Reproducibility;Running;Sampling;Selection for Treatments;Site;Solutions;Specimen;Speed;Staging;Standards of Weights and Measures;System;Taq Polymerase;Technology;Testing;Therapeutic;Time;Universities;Validation;base;cost;design;improved;inhibitor/antagonist;innovation;malignant breast neoplasm;nano;nanofluidic;neoplastic;novel;nuclease;outcome forecast;prognostic;research study;tumor;validation studies,Tony E Godfrey; Tom B Morrison; James C.

1R21CA137689-01,R21CA137689,7586347,2009,Massively Parallel Sequencing Technology for Cancer Epigenome.,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Methylated CpG island amplification (MCA) is a DNA library construction technique that permits amplification of 146,148 methylated CpG rich regions throughout the whole genome, covering 76% of all genes and 70% of all bona fide CpG islands. When coupled with microarrays, this technique has proven to be highly specific and very useful for the high-throughput analysis of genome-wide methylation in normal and cancer cells. Problems such as non-uniform probe performance, cross-reactivity, difficulties of normalization, and issues of relevant controls, however, prevent the full quantitative potential of MCA from being realized. We propose to develop and validate a high-resolution tool for DNA methylation profiling by coupling MCA with 'next generation' Solexa 1G sequencing technology (MCA-Seq). During the R21 phase of the project, we will apply various strategies to optimize MCA-Seq to improve coverage and minimize the quantity of initial DNA required. Additionally, we will build quality controls for MCA-Seq and develop optimized algorithms for data analysis. We will then validate our optimized MCA-Seq protocols, and evaluate the sensitivity, specificity, and quantitative accuracy using an innovative approach that simulates biological variation in methylation. Our proposed research will result in the development of a simple, robust, and reliable genome-wide assay for DNA methylation which will have broad utility in cancer research. Our long term goal is to utilize this technology to test biological hypotheses. Therefore, in an R33 phase of this project, we plan to fully implement this emerging technology by applying MCA-Seq in a set of well characterized tumor cell lines and primary cancer patient samples.

1R21CA177395-01A1,R21CA177395,8664139,2014,A novel single-molecule telomere characterization technology for analyzing cancer,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Single-telomere-specific (TTAGGG)n tract lengths and instabilities cannot be measured globally using current methods; the ability to do so would be a major, transformative addition to the arsenal of tools for analyzing critical telomere loss an telomere elongation events in cancer. The shortest telomere or a small subset of the shortest telomeres in a cell will determine the onset of senescence, apoptosis, or genome instability; single (TTAGGG)n tracts are crucial for the function of telomeres and the biological effects of telomere attrition and dysfunction. Telomere loss, breakage, fusion, and rejoining are highly elevated in cancer, but current methods for detecting and measuring these mutational events at the molecular level are limited and low-throughput. The technology we propose to develop here would permit quantitative, single- allele-resolution measurements of telomere length and instability, enabling unprecedented insights into the role(s) telomere loss, telomere breakage/re-joining, and telomerase or ALT dependent telomere elongation play in carcinogenesis, including mechanistic insights into molecular events mediating these processes and translational insights for the potential prognostic and tumor stratification applicability of the methods. In this method, input genomic DNA is labeled with fluorescent dyes specific for (TTAGGG)n sequences and for linked subtelomeric DNA. The labeled individual DNA fragments are linearized (stretched) and imaged in the nano-channels of Bionano Genomics system at very high throughput. The lengths of the telomere are measured accurately and the distances between probes in the subtelomere region are determined accurately to infer the identity of the telomere. Our goals for this R21 study are to establish feasibility for (1) high-throughput single-molecule detection and quantitation of (TTAGGG)n tracts in genomic DNA samples and (2) subtelomere probe development and efficient co-labeling of telomeres and subtelomeres in the context of total genomic DNA, including conversion of the labeled DNA to double- stranded DNA suitable for nano-channel analysis; and (3) proof-of-principle results for the technology and its applicability for cancer research using data generated and analyzed for a normal and a cancer cell line. There are significant technical challenges inherent in this early-stage technology development project, but the extraordinary payoff for cancer research will be a high-throughput ability to probe mechanisms of telomere length regulation and telomere mutation at single-telomere resolution, in small (ultimately single-cell) samples of both dividing and non-dividing cells.",Alleles;Apoptosis;Bar Codes;Base Pairing;Biological;Biological Assay;Biology;Cancer cell line;Cells;Chromosomes;Collection;DNA;Data;Detection;Development;Diploidy;Event;Fibroblasts;Fluorescent Dyes;Functional disorder;Genome;Genomic DNA;Genomic Instability;Genomics;Goals;Human;Image;Individual;Interphase Cell;Label;Length;Link;Maintenance;Malignant Neoplasms;Measurement;Measures;Mediating;Methods;Miniaturization;Molecular;Mutation;Neoplasm Circulating Cells;Pattern;Performance;Play;Population;Process;Regulation;Resolution;Role;Sampling;Scheme;Signal Transduction;Site;Sorting - Cell Movement;Specificity;Staging;Stratification;Stretching;System;Technology;Telomerase;Testing;Time;anticancer research;base;cancer cell;cancer genome;cancer stem cell;carcinogenesis;design;ds-DNA;high throughput analysis;insight;nanochannel;neoplastic cell;novel;prognostic;public health relevance;research study;senescence;single molecule;technology development;telomere;tool;tumor,Harold Riethman; Ming Xiao,Jerry Li,304593,304593,2014-05-13T12:05:00Z,2014-05-13T12:05:00Z,2017-04-30T12:04:00Z,RFA-CA-13-001,nofo_RFA-CA-13-001,wistar institute,PHILADELPHIA,PA,UNITED STATES,imat,org_name,True

1R21CA191186-01,R21CA191186,8810908,2015,Droplet Microfluidic Platform for Ultralow Input Epigenetics,"﻿ DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epigenomic analyses are playing increasingly prominent roles in the development of personalized strategies for treating cancer. However, the translation of fundamental epigenomic insight to the clinic is wrought with challenges. Take for example the study of post-translational histone protein modifications, which can serve to either promote or repress the transcription of pendant DNA sequences. Analyses of these critically important interactions bridge genomics and proteomics and present significant challenges in the clinical setting. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) is the method of choice for analyzing protein-DNA interactions and the basic method involves fragmentation of chromatin, separation of modified proteins using antibodies and magnetic beads, and subsequent analysis of the associated DNA by qPCR or sequencing. While sounding simple, a typical ChIP workflow involves ~30 steps, takes 4+ days, and requires 106-107 cells as input. These requirements significantly limit the applicability of ChIP in a clinical setting-particularly when minimal sampl is available, such as in the analysis of tumor biopsies, stem cells, or circulating tumor cells. Microfluidic devices offer many attractive benefits over traditional macro-scale methods including reduced volume requirements, parallelization capability, and automated operation, which make them particularly well- suited to sample-constrained epigenetic analyses. A handful of recent reports suggest a substantial opportunity for microfluidically-enabled ChIP analyses; however, there is still considerable room for further improvement. We propose to develop a powerful and versatile, droplet microfluidics-based, nanoliter-scale Chromatin ImmunoCapture (nChIC) platform suitable for individualized medicine applications. Droplet microfluidics offer several benefits, including rapid, controlled, and efficient fluid handling, and the capacity to handle variable sample sizes, since devices can accommodate larger samples by simply operating for longer periods of time. Our nChIC platform will incorporate every major step in the ChIP workflow into an automated device, including cell lysis, chromatin digestion, immunocapture, and DNA purification. Importantly, these processes will be carried out at the single cell level, which promises to provide unique insights into epigenomic tumor heterogeneity. Beyond single cells, the unprecedented ability to handle samples of variable input will also facilitate robust validation against traditional ChIP assays to demonstrate broad genomic coverage. Taken together, we feel that the nChIC platform will be a powerful new tool that enables the translation of epigenomic insight into individualized cancer treatment at the point of care.",Address;Aging;Antibodies;Automation;Basic Science;Benchmarking;Biological Assay;Biopsy;Cancer Biology;Cell Nucleus;Cells;Chromatin;Clinic;Clinical;Complex;Cytolysis;DNA;DNA Modification Process;DNA Repair;DNA Sequence;DNA analysis;DNA biosynthesis;DNA purification;DNA-Protein Interaction;Development;Device Designs;Devices;Digestion;Dinucleosome;Encapsulated;Epigenetic Process;Genetic Transcription;Genome;Genomics;Goals;Gold;Heterogeneity;Histones;Liquid substance;Malignant Neoplasms;Methods;Microfluidic Microchips;Microfluidics;Molecular Target;Mono-S;Neoplasm Circulating Cells;Non-Histone Chromosomal Proteins;Nucleosomes;Oils;Phase;Play;Population;Post-Translational Protein Processing;Preparation;Process;Proteins;Proteomics;Protocols documentation;Publishing;Recovery;Reporting;Research;Resolution;Role;Sample Size;Sampling;Side;Signal Transduction;Stem cells;Technology;Testing;Time;Touch sensation;Translational Research;Translations;Untranslated RNA;Validation;Variant;Writing;aqueous;base;cancer diagnosis;cancer stem cell;cancer therapy;carcinogenesis;cell fate specification;chromatin immunoprecipitation;cost effective;epigenomics;genome-wide;histone modification;individualized medicine;insight;magnetic beads;nanolitre scale;operation;personalized cancer therapy;point of care;protein complex;public health relevance;skills;sound;synthetic construct;technology development;tool;transcription factor;treatment strategy;tumor,Ryan C Bailey; Tamas Ordog,Rao L Divi,205437,205437,2015-02-16T12:02:00Z,2015-02-16T12:02:00Z,2018-01-31T12:01:00Z,RFA-CA-14-003,nofo_RFA-CA-14-003,university of illinois at urbana-champaign,CHAMPAIGN,IL,UNITED STATES,imat,org_name,False
1R21CA193064-01,R21CA193064,8851376,2015,Cellular biofactories for therapeutic protein synthesis in tumor microenvironment,"﻿ DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): T cells undergo an intelligent decision-making process based on the inhibitory and excitatory chemotactic inputs; and extravagate to the tumor microenvironment through solid tissue barriers. Investigators' long-term goal, to be pursued in R33 phase, is to develop T cells into a platform vector technology for active drug- transport to the solid tumors. In this R21 application, their objective is to engineer a robust mechanism to transform autologous T cells into biofactories for autonomous synthesis of cytocidal secretory proteins upon stimulation by the tumor cells. Autonomous synthesis of Protein-of-Interest (PoI) with spatiotemporal resolution will enable targeting of tumor burden with cellular resolution and molecular specificity. Their central hypothesis is that T cells can be genetically encoded for robust modulation and biosynthesis of therapeutic proteins at the tumor site. They have chosen ovarian cancer that expresses Folate Receptor alpha (FRa) as disease model, and an apoptotic protein for its cytotoxic therapeutic value. However, the rationale for developing T cells as protein biofactories is that this is a platform technology and their specificity can be modified to target any cancer and autonomously synthesize any PoI in situ. To aid this R21 effort, they have developed cell lines expressing bioluminescent and fluorescent reporters expressed only when stimulated by tumor cells. With following specific aims, they will advance this project towards its goals: (1) To develop robust control on biosynthesis of protein-of-interest (PoI); (2) To develop T cells as biofactories for autonomous secretion of antitumor apoptotic protein. It is expected that this R21 phase will lead to T cells that will not activate in healthy tissues (enhanced safety) and hyperactivate specifically in the tumor microenvironment (enhanced efficacy). The impact of this research will also be felt on ongoing T-cell therapy trials by reducing the incidences of graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD). This pioneering approach builds upon ongoing T-cell immunotherapy trials, which are currently limited to control minimal residual disease (MRD) and is administered after chemotherapy. Proposed research is transformative, firstly because it will expand the scope of T-cell engineering to replace systemic chemotherapies. This will then be used for reduction of tumor burden rather than keeping MRD in check. Secondly, therapeutic proteins of non-human origin are efficiently degraded and removed by the immune system. This is a barrier to their in vivo application. The use of autologous T cells for biosynthesis of therapeutic proteins at the target site will eliminate any immunogenicity issues. Unusually high impact is expected because the specificity of T cells can be redirected towards the surface markers on different cancers and therefore be used to target multitude of cancers.",Address;Amidohydrolases;Anabolism;Antigen Targeting;Antigens;Apoptotic;Autologous;Cell Line;Cytoplasm;Decision Making;Development;Disease model;Drug Delivery Systems;Drug Transport;Engineering;Foundations;Future;Goals;IL6 gene;Immune system;Immunosuppressive Agents;Immunotherapy;In Situ;Incidence;Injection of therapeutic agent;Intercellular Fluid;Lead;Malignant Neoplasms;Malignant neoplasm of ovary;Mission;Molecular;Penicillin G;Permeability;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phase;Process;Prodrugs;Protein Biosynthesis;Proteins;Public Health;Regulation;Reporter;Reporting;Research;Research Personnel;Residual Neoplasm;Resolution;Response Elements;Safety;Site;Solid;Solid Neoplasm;Specificity;Surface;System;T cell response;T cell therapy;T-Cell Development;T-Cell Immunologic Specificity;T-Lymphocyte;Technology;Therapeutic;Therapy trial;Tissues;Transgenes;Tumor Antigens;Tumor Burden;Work;amidase;base;cellular engineering;chemotherapy;chimeric antigen receptor;cytotoxic;graft vs host disease;human FOLR1 protein;immunogenicity;in vivo;interest;nanoparticle;neoplastic cell;nuclear factors of activated T-cells;pressure;prevent;promoter;public health relevance;secretory protein;spatiotemporal;success;therapeutic protein;tumor;tumor microenvironment;tumor specificity;vector,Parijat Bhatnagar,Tawnya C Mckee,1,1,2015-05-19T12:05:00Z,2015-06-01T12:06:00Z,2015-06-02T12:06:00Z,RFA-CA-14-003,nofo_RFA-CA-14-003,baylor college of medicine,HOUSTON,TX,UNITED STATES,imat,org_name,False
1R21CA196418-01,R21CA196418,8928922,2015,"Multiplexed, Quantitative Fluorescence Imaging in Tumor Sections","﻿ DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Precision medicine for cancer requires knowledge of the driver mutations in a particular patient's tumor. Recent single cell genetic studies have shown that driver mutations and cancer cell subtype are highly heterogeneous within a single patient. Thus, clinicians will need to employ experimental methods that allow observation of a variety of molecular analytes across many individual cells within a particular patient's tumor section in situ. Current tumor section analyses are not highly multiplexed and typically remain limited to ~4-5 analytes, or 7 with multi-spectral imaging. Recent technologies have pushed this number into 30s-60s, but they require expensive equipment and/or reagents, sophisticated analyses or markedly increased assay time, all of which would preclude their practical use in many clinical pathology and preclinical research laboratories. Thus, there remains a significant need for technologies that multiplex measurements in tumor sections but are widely accessible and cost-effective. We focus on addressing this need with a readily-adoptable but novel multi- spectral fluorescence-based method. It is based on the hypothesis that the power of combinatorics can be harnessed to vastly increase the number of quantifiable analytes in a mixture by permuting the wide array of available fluorophores in new ways. We term our approach combinatorial fluorescence with spectral imaging (CoFSI). CoFSI only requires the ability to perform multi-channel fluorescence excitation and emission spectral scanning, which is widely available and easy to implement in most plate/slide readers and many microscopes. Data analysis involves a straightforward, fast computational technique called linear unmixing. Preliminary simulation studies suggest that the concentrations of 123 different CoFSI probes constructed from 16 existing fluorescent proteins can be estimated simultaneously with good accuracy and precision across 3 orders of concentration magnitude with a large number of excitation channels, and 48 probes with 6 excitation channels. Similar simulation studies constrained by available tumor section imaging equipment and Alexa dyes suggest 25 simultaneous measurements are possible. Initial pilot experiments demonstrate that seven different CoFSI probe levels in a mixture can be measured both accurately and precisely using only the blue-yellow part of the spectrum. This proposal further tests the limits of CoFSI experimentally, and applies CoFSI to tumor section imaging, with two Aims: (1) Quantify the Levels of 48 Fluorescent Probes in a Mixture Simultaneously; and (2) Quantify the Spatial Distribution of 25 Analytes in Tumor Sections. If successful, CoFSI can increase quantitative fluorescence multiplexing at least ~5 to 10-fold while relying on standard lab resources and straightforward analyses. CoFSI is also feasibly compatible with other difficult-to-multiplex technologies such as high content screening, live-cell imaging, and in vivo rodent imaging, and thus may have broad impact.",Address;Antibodies;Antigens;Architecture;Area;Basic Science;Binding;Biological Assay;Biological Markers;Biopsy Specimen;Breast Cancer cell line;Cells;Chemicals;Classification;Clinic;Clinical Data;Clinical Pathology;Combinatorics;Computational Technique;Cytometry;Data;Data Analyses;Diagnostic;Dyes;Epitopes;Equipment;Escherichia coli;Fluorescence;Fluorescent Probes;Genetic study;Heterogeneity;Image;In Situ;In Situ Hybridization;Individual;Knowledge;Label;Laboratories;Life;Malignant Neoplasms;Measurement;Measures;Methods;Microscope;Molecular;Mus;Mutation;Nucleic Acids;Oncologist;Patients;Pharmacologic Substance;Principal Investigator;Proteins;Reader;Reagent;Research;Resolution;Resources;Rodent;Sample Size;Sampling;Scanning;Science;Slide;Solutions;Spatial Distribution;Staining method;Stains;System;Techniques;Technology;Testing;Time;Tissues;Translating;Writing;Xenograft procedure;Yeasts;base;cancer cell;cell type;cellular imaging;clinical decision-making;clinically relevant;combinatorial;cost effective;data acquisition;deep sequencing;drug development;fluorescence imaging;fluorophore;imaging modality;imaging probe;improved;in vivo;insight;malignant breast neoplasm;novel;optical spectra;outcome forecast;pre-clinical;pre-clinical research;precision medicine;public health relevance;research and development;research study;screening;simulation;spectrograph;treatment response;tumor;tumor microenvironment;tumor xenograft,Marc R.

1R21CA202831-01,R21CA202831,9036024,2016,Novel Bi-functional Inhibitors Blocking OncomiR Biogenesis,"﻿ DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this proposal is to develop a new class of selective miRNA regulators that blocks the maturation of oncomiRs. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate diverse biological processes. Dysregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) has become one of the emerging mechanisms contributes to cancer formation and progression. Increasing evidences suggest that certain miRNAs affect cellular transformation, carcinogenesis and metastasis, and act as oncogenes (oncogenic miRNAs or oncomiRs). Understanding the roles of oncomiRs in cancer will lead to the development of new cancer therapies. Besides, direct therapeutic intervention of oncomiRs has become a promising new direction for treating cancer. For both research and therapeutic purposes, methods allowing the control of oncomiR levels are highly desirable. Current methods for such purposes generally suffer from the off-target inhibition. To address this critical issue, we propose a novel strategy to regulate miRNA. We will develop a new class of bi-functional miRNA regulators consisting of independent and specialized ""pre-miRNA recognition unit"" and ""Dicer inhibition unit"" to target unique pre- miRNAs and block their processing to generate mature miRNAs by inhibiting Dicer enzymatic activity. The following Aims will accomplish our goal of establishing this new strategy: Aim 1. Synthesize and test bi- functional miRNA regulators. We will synthesize bi-functional regulators for miRNA-21 (miR-21) and other oncomiRs and test their inhibitory activity. Aim 2: Test the activity and specificity of the bi-functional miRNA regulator in cells. We will optimize cellular uptake of the regulator in mammalian cells. The cellular activity and off-target effects of the regulator will be evaluated in cells. This work will establish the technical foundation of a novel oncomiR regulation strategy. This unique technology will address the major obstacle encountered in current miRNA regulating methods and enhance the capability to dissect the roles of oncomiRs in cancer biology. It will significantly contribute to the advancement in our knowledge of the role played by oncomiRs in cancer and will result in the development of novel cancer therapies either directly based on the bi- modular regulators or evolved from the understanding of oncomiR functions unveiled by this new technology.",Address;Adverse effects;Affect;Affinity;Antisense Oligonucleotides;Binding;Biogenesis;Biological Assay;Biological Process;Cancer Biology;Cell physiology;Cells;Development;Dicer Enzyme;Foundations;Generations;Goals;In Vitro;Knowledge;Lead;Link;Malignant Neoplasms;Mammalian Cell;Messenger RNA;Methods;MicroRNAs;Neoplasm Metastasis;Northern Blotting;Oncogenes;Oncogenic;Pathogenesis;Play;Process;Proteins;RNA;Regulation;Research;Role;Specificity;Technology;Testing;Therapeutic Human Experimentation;Therapeutic Intervention;Untranslated RNA;Western Blotting;Work;base;cancer therapy;cancer type;carcinogenesis;design;improved;inhibitor/antagonist;interest;metaplastic cell transformation;new technology;next generation;novel;novel strategies;novel therapeutics;public health relevance;research and development;ribosome profiling;transcriptome sequencing;uptake,Fu-Sen Liang,John R Knowlton,185078,185078,2016-04-07T12:04:00Z,2016-05-01T12:05:00Z,2019-04-30T12:04:00Z,RFA-CA-15-002,nofo_RFA-CA-15-002,university of new mexico,ALBUQUERQUE,NM,UNITED STATES,imat,org_name,False

Ty- rosine phosphorylation often becomes dysregulated in cancer and therefore, understanding the effect of phos- phorylation on protein function will be paramount to identifying therapeutic interventions in cancer. Unfortunately, an important tool in the basic research of phosphorylation – testing the effect of protein phosphorylation by com- paring the function of the phosphorylated form with an unphosphorylated form of the protein in in vitro assays – is signiﬁcantly hindered by our limited knowledge in how to make a phosphorylated protein. This project seeks to build a molecular technology, inspired by previous observations of biochemistry in cell networks, to overcome this requirement and improve the pace of basic research. The goal of this research is to build a fast, accessible and inexpensive method for producing phosphorylated and soluble proteins in a bacterial system. The goals will be achieved by: development of a molecular toolkit for the enhancement and control of precise phosphorylation on protein substrates using secondary kinase-substrate targeting approaches, testing the toolkit on a set of sub- strates, and comparing the outcome with current technologies. It is anticipated that this technology will be less expensive, more physiologically-relevant, and capable of producing a larger variety of phosphorylated forms of proteins than current molecular approaches to studying the effect of protein phosphorylation.",Amino Acid Sequence;Automobile Driving;Basic Cancer Research;Basic Science;Binding;Biochemical;Biochemistry;Biological;Biological Assay;Cells;Darkness;Development;Engineering;Escherichia coli;Glutamic Acid;Goals;Grant;Human;Kinetics;Knowledge;Libraries;Malignant Neoplasms;Mass Spectrum Analysis;Measurement;Measures;Methods;Molecular;Molecular Bank;Mutate;Outcome;Pattern;Phosphoproteins;Phosphorylation;Phosphotransferases;Phosphotyrosine;Physiological;Post-Translational Protein Processing;Process;Production;Property;Proteins;Proteome;Recombinant Proteins;Recombinants;Regulation;Research;Research Personnel;SH3 Domains;Signal Transduction;Specificity;Substrate Domain;Substrate Specificity;System;Technology;Testing;Therapeutic Intervention;Thick;Tyrosine;Tyrosine Phosphorylation;Work;base;improved;in vitro Assay;polyproline;protein function;src Homology Region 2 Domain;technology development;tool;vector,Kristen M Naegle,John R Knowlton,228750,228750,2017-08-16T12:08:00Z,2017-08-16T12:08:00Z,2020-07-31T12:07:00Z,RFA-CA-16-001,nofo_RFA-CA-16-001,washington university,SAINT LOUIS,MO,UNITED STATES,imat,org_name,True
1R21CA223901-01,R21CA223901,9443530,2018,Precision controllers of mammalian gene expression,"Project Summary/ Abstract We will build systems that allow greatly improved chemically-tuned control of gene expression in mammalian cells, and make them available to other researchers. Induction of gene expression on demand is a mainstay of modern biology and cancer research. Nowadays, this is commonly accomplished by one particular approach, induction by tetracycline analogs of gene expression driven by Tn10 TetR derivatives. The TetR derivatives and doctrine for using them date from the early 1990s. These 20+ year-old methods continue to aid research on oncoproteins, tumor suppressors, cell death proteins, cell cycle proteins, and other key proteins and RNAs in cells and animals. But these approaches suffer from serious limitations. First, systems in common use operationally produce all-or-nothing induction, rather than tunable expression. Second, TetR is the only well developed chemically-inducible DNA binding moiety in wide use, and, as a consequence, investigators can typically only conditionally induce one gene product or trigger one event. Finally, these systems do not use closed- loop or feedback control. Induced gene expression is thus subject to significant cell-to-cell variation, much of it due to intracellular differences in gene expression capacity, G. A number of developments now allow us to build systems not subject to these limitations. Consideration of feedback control in bacterial systems, better understanding of artificial repression by prokaryotic repressors in eukaryotes (which we developed in the 1980s), and work in yeast has enabled systems that offer tunable induction buffered against cell-cell variation. Wholesale bacterial DNA sequencing has revealed 1000s of new TetR family repressors to make new proteins. Cas9/ CRISPR approaches now facilitate experimentation to optimize performance, by making it possible to compare expression from different test constructs integrated in single copy at the same mammalian genomic site. In this pilot phase of work, we will concentrate the risks of using lessons from yeast to build better controllers of mammalian gene expression. We will develop and distribute to other researchers at least three (3) new chemically tunable mammalian controllers that respond to different small-molecule ligands. We expect that these controllers will become broadly used in cancer research, enabling (among many examples) a) finer control of timing and amount of oncoproteins and other key proteins in cells and animals b) tighter definition of threshold levels of proteins that cause biological effects c) optimization of timing and level of expression of multiple transcription factors to best generate specific differentiated cell types d) construction of cell lines with controlled oncoprotein expression to be used in screens for anticancer drugs.",20 year old;Animals;Antineoplastic Agents;Bacteria;Bacterial DNA;Binding Sites;Biological;Biology;Bone Marrow;Buffers;CRISPR/Cas technology;Cell Cycle Proteins;Cell Death;Cell Differentiation process;Cell Line;Cell Lineage;Cells;Chemicals;Cultured Cells;DNA Binding;DNA sequencing;Development;Engineering;Eukaryota;Event;Family;Feedback;Gene Expression;Gene Expression Regulation;Genes;Genomics;Goals;Learning;Ligands;Light;Mammalian Cell;Methods;Modeling;Modernization;Molecular Biology;Oncoproteins;Performance;Phase;Phylogeny;Process;Proteins;Reagent;Repression;Repressor Proteins;Research;Research Personnel;Risk;Scientist;Signal Transduction;Signaling Protein;Site;Source;System;Technology;Testing;Tetanus Helper Peptide;Tetracyclines;Time;Transplantation;Tumor Suppressor Proteins;Variant;Work;Yeasts;analog;anticancer research;base;cell type;control theory;design;experimental study;gene induction;gene product;genetic regulatory protein;genome sequencing;improved;inducible gene expression;insight;promoter;response;small molecule;transcription factor,Roger Brent,Jerry Li,308000,308000,2018-01-23T12:01:00Z,2018-02-01T12:02:00Z,2021-01-31T12:01:00Z,RFA-CA-17-010,nofo_RFA-CA-17-010,fred hutchinson cancer research center,SEATTLE,WA,UNITED STATES,imat,org_name,False
1R21CA229044-01,R21CA229044,9572744,2018,Novel platform linking cancer-specific glycosylation with cell signaling outcomes,ABSTRACT Abnormal glycosylation is a hallmark of many cancers that contributes to tumor growth and invasion. There are many protein receptors that are regulated abnormally in cancer due to mutations and/or alterations in glycosylation. Studies to link specific glycosylation changes to signaling outcomes have primarily focused on studies of individual receptors or specific pathways. Methods that can link forms of tumor-specific glycosylation to global effects on signaling pathway activation are needed to better identify potential new targets for therapeutics. To overcome this limitation we are employing the use of heterobifunctional molecule that will link cancer-specific glycosylation on protein receptors with a proximity- induced ubiquitination. To demonstrate the potential and applicability of this method we are using a novel scFv antibody that recognizes tumor-specific glycans present on ovarian cancer and glioblastoma cells that has been demonstrated to have excellent cell permeability. Combining the scFv with proteolysis targeting molecules will enable us to identify receptors and signaling changes using mass spectrometry methods. Successful completion of this project will establish a new platform useful for both basic science research and clinical therapeutic development.,Address;Animal Model;Antibodies;Area;Basic Science;Binding;Cancer Control;Cell Line;Cell Surface Proteins;Cell surface;Cells;Chimera organism;Clinical;Development;Evolution;Feasibility Studies;Future;Glioblastoma;Global Change;Glycoproteins;Goals;Growth;HIF1A gene;Human;In Vitro;Incubated;Individual;Knowledge;Ligands;Link;Longevity;Malignant - descriptor;Malignant Neoplasms;Malignant neoplasm of ovary;Maps;Mass Spectrum Analysis;Mediating;Membrane Proteins;Methods;Mutation;Outcome;Output;Pathway interactions;Peptide Hydrolases;Permeability;Polysaccharides;Post-Translational Protein Processing;Protein Glycosylation;Proteins;Proteolysis;Receptor Signaling;Research;Research Personnel;Research Proposals;Scientist;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;Specificity;Stains;Structure;Testing;Therapeutic;Tumor Cell Invasion;Tumor Tissue;Ubiquitin;Ubiquitination;Xenograft Model;cancer cell;cancer therapy;chimeric antibody;clinical application;clinical implementation;glycosylation;improved;in vivo;innovation;intraperitoneal;method development;migration;mutant;new therapeutic target;novel;receptor;small hairpin RNA;subcutaneous;sugar;therapeutic development;tool;tumor;tumor growth;tumor xenograft;tumorigenesis,Karen L.

1R21CA258013-01,R21CA258013,10174448,2021,Device for Preservation of Cell Free RNA in Saliva,"ABSTRACT Early detection is critical to cancer mortality reductions, and yet the breast imaging clinic visits required for these life-saving early detection programs are inaccessible to disadvantaged, remote, or quarantined populations with limited medical facility access. In fact, breast cancer surveillance programs this year have stalled by as much as 90% versus their pre-pandemic rates, resulting in risky delays in new cancer diagnosis [1]. A saliva-based test for early detection could transform today’s screening paradigms. A promising biofluid for disease detection, saliva can be self-sampled non-invasively, without trained technicians. Saliva is ideal for at-home and other non-clinical site collection; it contains a variety of analytes including exosomes, RNA, DNA, proteins, metabolites, viruses and oral microflora, and is a powerful window on health and disease. Recently, saliva samples have shown better clinical utility vs. nasal swabs for detecting COVID-19 [2]. Mounting evidence exists for oral microbiome links to systemic disease [3], and salivary biomarkers diagnose complex traits such as pediatric medical conditions, traumatic brain injury, autism, and cancer [4-7]. A commercial saliva-based test for autism is based on 32 human and microbial RNA markers [8]. In many complex trait studies, saliva is frozen as cell-free supernatant. The most prevalent saliva collection and preservation devices, although easy-to-use, preclude effective cell-free RNA and exosome analysis, since saliva samples are treated with lysis reagents resulting in mixed populations of cellular and non-cellular RNAs, increasing noise and damaging performance characteristics. Saliva collection devices that instead use membranes to separate cells suffer from inefficient recovery of critical analytes, either because they lack appropriate preservatives or because they adsorb and therefore lose, a substantial analyte fraction. To enable widespread use for disease detection, new standardized methods are needed to preserve cell-free saliva and retain the integrity of its key constituents for stable transport and downstream analysis. This project extends our past SBIR grant work and our own internal research, to develop an easy-to-use saliva collection and preservation device to stabilize cfRNA and other analytes, enabling us and others to efficiently collect high-quality clinical saliva samples. Using RT-qPCR assays and RNA isotype profiles, we will characterize salivary cfRNA integrity and stability over timelines sufficient for remote collection and transport. Armed with well-characterized RNA decay profiles, we propose an iterative design-of-experiment approach to prototype a versatile device to collect and preserve saliva at room temperature (RT), stabilizing RNA while also preventing cell lysis and bacterial growth. Our device performance validation will use prospectively collected and preserved saliva from >50 women to demonstrate stability for up 72 hours at ambient conditions. This device will standardize methods for collection, stability, and transport of saliva, key to driving virtualized sample collection and healthcare in cancer, viral, and other diagnostics, increasingly critical to a post-pandemic world.",Adoption;Automobile Driving;Biocide;Biological Assay;Biological Markers;Blood specimen;Breast Cancer Detection;COVID-19;COVID-19 detection;COVID-19 pandemic;Cells;Centrifugation;Characteristics;Childhood;Clinic;Clinic Visits;Clinical;Clinical Research;Collection;Complex;Cytolysis;DNA;Detection;Development;Devices;Diagnosis;Diagnostic;Diagnostic tests;Disadvantaged;Disease;Early Diagnosis;Facility Accesses;Feedback;Fractionation;Freezing;Future;Genomics;Grant;Growth;Health;Healthcare;Home;Hour;Human;Image;Individual;Laboratories;Life;Link;Malignant Neoplasms;Manuals;Measurement;Measures;Medical;Medicine;Membrane;Methods;Microbe;Mixed Cellular Population;Molecular;Monitor;Noise;Nucleic Acids;Office Visits;Participant;Patients;Performance;Phase;Population;Process;Property;Quarantine;RNA;RNA Decay;RNA Degradation;RNA Stability;RNA marker;Reagent;Recovery;Research;Saliva;Salivary;Sampling;Savings;Ships;Site;Small Business Innovation Research Grant;Standardization;Surveillance Program;Systemic disease;Temperature;Testing;TimeLine;Training;Traumatic Brain Injury;Validation;Venous blood sampling;Viral;Virus;Woman;Work;autism spectrum disorder;base;biomarker panel;breast imaging;cancer diagnosis;clinical diagnostics;cost;design;exosome;experimental study;innovation;iterative design;malignant breast neoplasm;microbial;microbiota;microorganism growth;mortality;nasal swab;next generation sequencing;nuclease;oral microbial community;oral microbiome;pandemic disease;participant enrollment;pathogen;point of care;preservation;prevent;programs;prospective;protein metabolite;prototype;saliva sample;salivary assay;salivary cell;sample collection;screening;trait;usability;virtual,Shivani Nautiyal,Karl E Krueger,232400,232400,2021-06-03T12:06:00Z,2021-06-03T12:06:00Z,2023-05-31T12:05:00Z,RFA-CA-20-019,nofo_RFA-CA-20-019,"prime genomics, inc.",Mountain View,CA,UNITED STATES,imat,org_name,False
1R33CA105295-01,R33CA105295,6726573,2004,Ovarian Cancer Screening Using Comprehensive Proteomics,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The development of biomarkers for earlier detection of ovarian cancer will greatly improve survival. Most women present with advanced stage disease with survival rates of roughly 20%. Advances in the field of proteomics now provide the tools necessary to effectively analyze the serum proteome, and the application of such technologies holds great promise for determining novel biomarkers. This proposal outlines methods to comprehensively discover, identify, quantify, and validate a panel of specific and sensitive ovarian cancer biomarkers for early detection. We propose the following Specific Aims: 1. Determine candidate ovarian cancer biomarkers defined by comprehensive biomarker analysis of serum. Emphasis will be placed on refining the most effective overall analytical strategy for comprehensive and reproducible measurements. Spectral peaks that most accurately distinguish cancer vs. control will be identified using high-resolving power technology. Biostatistics and bioinformatics will be used to prioritize candidate markers (according to specificity, sensitivity and predictive value) for further characterization. 2. Identification and absolute quantification of the candidate biomarkers. This will improve reliability and high-throughput capabilities in subsequent validation testing, and the identification of these proteins will contribute further to research into the biologic basis of the disease. We will use accurate mass measurements, tandem mass spectrometry, and non-redundant protein and genome databases applied to distinct selected controls. Furthermore, we will determine the range of values for both normal and cancer serum samples using stable isotope labeled internal standards. 3. Clinical validation of a panel of biomarkers in specific groups of women. Sera from defined cohorts of women will be used to accurately determine the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of individual and combinations of candidate markers in all aspects of disease (early/late stage, familial, remission and recurrence) and in large numbers of non-cancer controls.",biomarker;clinical research;early diagnosis;female;high throughput technology;human middle age (35-64);human old age (65+);human subject;interview;mass spectrometry;menopause;neoplasm /cancer classification /staging;neoplasm /cancer diagnosis;neoplasm /cancer epidemiology;neoplasm /cancer relapse /recurrence;ovary neoplasms;protein quantitation /detection;proteomics;serum;stable isotope;women&apos;s health,David C.

1R33CA118602-01,R33CA118602,7024335,2006,Technology/Map Endothelial Targets/Human Renal Tumors,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The molecular complexity and in vivo inaccessibility of most tumor cells within solid tumors can greatly limit genomic- and proteomic-based discovery of useful targets for tumor-specific imaging and therapeutic agents in vivo. To overcome endothelial cell (EC) barriers and achieve more effective targeting and penetration into solid tumors, we shift analytical focus from the tumor cell to the vascular EC surface and its caveolae in direct contact with the circulating blood. To reduce data complexity to a meaningful subset of targetable proteins expressed on the EC surface, we will use tissue sub-cellular fractionation, novel multimodal mass spectrometric analysis, in silico subtraction, and bioinformatics interrogation of structure and function to unmask, from the >100,000 proteins in the tissue, those few intravenously accessible proteins differentially expressed on vascular endothelium in human renal tumors. This technology and overall approach has been validated in rodent solid tumors whereby new vascular targets have been uncovered permitting tumor-specific imaging, penetration, and effective radio immunotherapy (Nature, 429:629-35, 2004). But, currently very little is known about the expression of proteins in tumor neovascular endothelium, especially in human tissue. We now wish to apply our new technology to map comprehensively the proteome of luminal EC surfaces and caveolae in human renal tumors in vivo. It is likely that human tumors will express a different constellation of proteins on tumor neovasculature not yet uncovered or induced in animal models. To this end, we propose the following specific aims: 1) To use novel tissue sub fractionation and proteomic analytical approaches to map comprehensively vascular EC surfaces and caveolae in human renal tumors vs. matched normal renal tissue to unmask candidate tumor-induced/associated vascular proteins. 2) To create new antibodies to newly discovered human renal tumor EC targets and to use antibodies as probes to validate the expression of tumor-induced/associated proteins at the EC surface and its caveolae in human tissues and thereby to assess the degree of target specificity for the neovasculature of human solid tumors. Such mapping may also elucidate the effects of the tumor on the developing vascular endothelium and yield important tumor-specific vascular targets for improving noninvasive diagnostic imaging and therapy as well as yield new diagnostic and prognostic markers for the molecular classification of tumor biopsies",clinical research;human;kidney;neoplasm /cancer;tissues,Jan Eugeniusz Schnitzer,John R Knowlton,714748,714748,2006-03-24T12:03:00Z,2006-06-01T12:06:00Z,2009-05-31T12:05:00Z,RFA-CA-06-003,nofo_RFA-CA-06-003,sidney kimmel cancer center,SAN DIEGO,CA,UNITED STATES,imat,org_name,False

1R33CA206922-01,R33CA206922,9147682,2016,Online Raman Diagnostics of Oncometabolites,"Project Abstract Cancer cells utilize normal metabolic processes out of context to promote tumor survival. For example, Otto Warburg and others discovered that tumors have increased glucose uptake, glycolysis, and lactate production, often with a reduction in citric acid cycle. While “aerobic glycolysis” at first glance is energetically expensive for tumor cells because it circumvents high ATP production from the citric acid cycle, it allows cancer cells to survive under low nutrient or low oxygen conditions and to instead use glycolytic intermediates for the synthesis of essential cellular building blocks without further energy investment. This change in metabolite regulation suggests a powerful method for monitoring and diagnosing cancer. This project seeks to develop surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) as online detection method for the characterization of metabolites from breast cancer tumor models. Using the SERS results from tumor lysates, diagnostic algorithms will be constructed to improve treatment for cancer. Results show that fluid dynamics can be used to increase the reproducibility and sensitivity of SERS detection in flowing liquids. We propose to develop methodology to enable the use this innovation to investigate metabolites in cancer cell lysates using capillary electrophoresis coupled to a SERS flow detector. We will investigate known metabolites that have been linked to cancer, as well as examine key metabolites associated with oncogenes. The SERS data collected will be used to formulate diagnostic algorithms that can provide a yes/no indicator of cancer. The specific aims of this project are as follows: · AIM 1. Demonstrate the utility of the novel flow detector to assess changes in key metabolites from tumor cell lysates. The tumor cell lysates will be compared with non-cancerous cell lysates to identify trends in these metabolites relevant to breast cancer. · AIM 2. Compare the identification and quantification capabilities with the current gold standard, LC- MS. This aim will assess how SERS characterization both compares with existing technology but also increases coverage of the metabolome. · AIM 3. We will use the metabolites to develop statistical machine learning algorithms to predict the sample label (cancer or not). The predictor obtained will be used as a diagnostic tool of cancer.

1R33CA225539-01,R33CA225539,9492281,2018,An integrated therapeutic T cell receptor screening platform for adoptive cell therapy in cancer,"Abstract Recent successes of T cell receptor based adoptive cell transfer therapy have generated new excitement about this therapeutic approach. However, lacking a high-throughput method of screening of naturally occurring high- affinity therapeutic T cell receptors (TCRs) has put a limit on how widely this approach can be applied to different kinds of cancers and a large range of patients. In this study, we propose to develop an integrated platform that on one hand drastically speeds up the identification and test of therapeutic TCRs and on the other hand, profiles common cancer antigens and HLAs expressed in tumor sample at single cell level. We name it Magic-HAT for Matching antigen identification in cancer with High-Affinity TCRs. The success of this project breaks the bottleneck of identifying and testing naturally occurring therapeutic high-affinity TCRs in adoptive cell transfer therapy setting for a large panel of cancer antigen epitopes.

However, their widespread use is limited by a number of difficulties in manufacturing such cells. Current manufacturing processes are complicated, costly, and can only produce cells for small populations. Additionally, they have large production variations. As a result, different patients receive very different products or treatments. The long-term goal is to develop a novel technology to address the CAR T manufacturing challenge. Toward this goal, the team has developed a proof- of-concept technology termed stress-free intra-tubular cell culture technology (SFIT). SFIT provides cells uniform, highly reproducible, controllable, and cell-friendly microenvironments, resulting in extremely high culture efficiency and consistency. SFIT produces cells for each patient with one small conical tube, significantly reducing production cost and increasing production capability. The purpose of this project is to further develop and validate this technology and the associated methods to make it ready for the final translational challenge. Leveraging sound preliminary studies and a diverse team of experts, the specific aims are to (1) validate SFIT for culturing T cells from a wide range of donors and for culturing various T cell subtypes, (2) further develop and validate methods for transducing T cells with lentivirus and γ-retrovirus in SFIT, and (3) further develop and validate the SFIT-based single-conical-tube-device for producing autologous CAR T cells. The project will build on the team’s strong preliminary work and include mathematical modeling, prototype device design, extensive T cell culturing, exome-Seq and RNA-Seq data analyses, in vivo testing, statistical analyses and comparisons, and partnership with ADS BIOTEC, a company that designs, builds, and sells instruments for processing human cells. With the completion of this project, simple, disposable, affordable devices for the scalable, cost-effective and consistent production of autologous CAR T cells are expected. This technology can also be scaled up for producing allogeneic CAR T cells in large scales if needed. This technology will not only make CAR T cells broadly accessible, but also make the product much more consistent and predictable. Based on 2012-2014 data, approximately 38.5% of the human population will be diagnosed with some type of cancer during their lifetime. Currently, only about 67% of cancer patients will survive five years after diagnosis. CAR T cell therapy is expected to significantly increase their chances of survival.

1R33CA256102-01,R33CA256102,10113151,2021,Multimodality X-ray transmission and diffraction scanner for molecular analysis of cancer specimens,"ABSTRACT Cancer research using biospecimens requires the analysis of samples with a large range of sizes (sub-mm to cm) and molecular composition over a wide range of length scales. In many cases, 3-dimensional spatial information about the specimen is critical to understanding and addressing the progression of the disease. X-ray imaging has been widely recognized to play a key role in tissue analysis and cancer assessment. While transmission X-ray imaging (radiography or CT) has been used successfully in some applications wherein sample morphology is highly correlated with the disease state, it lacks molecular specificity, which limits its general utility in specimen analysis. Many groups have demonstrated the utility of X-ray diffraction (XRD) in analyzing molecular structure in biospecimens; however, none have successfully implemented a viable method of fast and accurate 3D XRD measurement in a laboratory environment. The key challenges associated with realizing such a system include the fact that high accuracy XRD measurements have typically required access to a synchrotron or another specialized source, which is difficult for the average researcher to access. In contrast, conventional laboratory diffraction methods are slow, require destruction or alteration of the specimens, and exhibit poor or no volumetric spatial information. To overcome these challenges, we propose to develop a new radiographic imaging device that can scan the entire volume of a biospecimen and generate co-registered, multi-modal X-ray transmission and XRD images. Such technology would allow researchers to study molecular properties of tissue specimens with high spatial resolution and high specificity using a tool that is compact, robust, and easily accessible in an average research laboratory. The samples would be analyzed without contrast agents and with little to no sample preparation required. Through previous work, we have built, tested, and demonstrated the underlying technology required for combined transmission and diffraction imaging of biospecimens. We will now build a clinically accessible, high-resolution prototype of the scanner, test and validate its performance, and demonstrate its utility in imaging bone and breast cancer biospecimens. This project will provide a first-of-its-kind X-ray transmission/diffraction scanner for non-destructive analysis of cancer biospecimens, which could enable pathways for new clinical studies exploring the role of XRD in tissue abnormalities, eventually leading to a better understanding of the genesis and evolution of cancer.",,Joel Greenberg; Anuj J.

1R33CA281875-01,R33CA281875,10713795,2023,"MASTER Scaffolds for Rapid, Single-Step Manufacture and Prototyping of CAR-T cells","PROJECT SUMMARY Despite the unprecedented clinical success of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy, its widespread application is limited by lengthy and labor-intensive ex vivo manufacturing procedures that result in: (i) high cost; (ii) delays to infuse CAR cells to patients with rapidly progressing disease; and (iii) CAR cells with heterogeneous composition and terminal differentiation, which limit their engraftment and persistence. There is a clear scientific and medical need for approaches to improve CAR T cell production, including methods to reduce cell processing times, reduce manufacturing costs, and reduce CAR cell differentiation. Recently, our labs collaboratively developed a new technology for CAR cell production called MASTER (Multifunctional Alginate Scaffolds for T cell Engineering and Release). MASTER consists of dry, macroporous alginate materials conjugated to αCD3 and αCD28 antibodies and encapsulating interleukin signaling. CAR generation with MASTER technology involves seeding freshly isolated, non-activated patient PBMCs together with CAR-encoding retroviral vectors and implanting scaffolds back into patients. Once implanted, MASTER mediates every step of the CAR production process, thereby eliminating the current standard procedural steps of αCD3/αCD28 pre-activation, viral transduction with spinoculation and interleukin-mediated CAR expansion. In vitro MASTER-generated CAR cells demonstrate reduced cellular differentiation as compared to CAR cells generated with gold-standard, “conventional” clinical protocols. In vivo MASTER-generated CAR cells demonstrate far superior in vivo cell persistence, enhanced anti-tumor efficacy and far superior prevention of tumor growth after rechallenge. The utility of this system is two-fold: 1) as a transformative therapeutic technology creating enhanced and affordable CAR therapy for cancer care and 2) as a research tool enabling rapid development, prototyping and testing of CAR therapeutic candidates. We have assembled a focused, multidisciplinary team comprised of an expert in biomaterials and drug delivery (Brudno), an expert in viral engineering and protein production (Birnbaum), two specialists in clinical CAR cell production (Chen, Roy) and a clinician focused on CAR cell therapies (Grover). In this proposal we seek to further develop and validate MASTER scaffolds and the associated methods to make them ready for widescale utilization by the research and clinical communities, including researchers in related areas eager to work in the CAR field but deterred by the barriers to test CAR construct in vivo. Leveraging transformative preliminary data that show that the shelf-stable MASTER scaffolds outperform conventional CAR cells in preclinical mouse models of lymphoma, orthotopic pancreatic cancer, and metastatic lung and ovarian tumors this proposal will validate MASTER scaffolds with a wide range of donors and at different scales, with multiple viral vectors and CAR constructs and delineate the phenotype and function resulting from MASTER production of CAR cells. The successful completion of these aims will propel our ultimate vision of low-cost and tunable generation of CAR cells for both liquid and solid tumors and potentially beyond the oncology space.",Activities of Daily Living;Alginates;Antibodies;Area;B lymphoid malignancy;Back;Biocompatible Materials;CAR T cell therapy;CD28 gene;CD3 Antigens;Cancer Patient;Cell Count;Cell Differentiation process;Cell Therapy;Cell physiology;Cells;Clinic;Clinical;Clinical Protocols;Communities;Data;Development;Disease Progression;Disseminated Malignant Neoplasm;Drug Delivery Systems;Dryness;Encapsulated;Engineering;Engraftment;Generations;Goals;Implant;In Vitro;Interleukins;Liquid substance;Lung Neoplasms;Lymphoma;Malignant neoplasm of lung;Malignant neoplasm of ovary;Malignant neoplasm of pancreas;Measures;Mediating;Medical;Methods;Modeling;Names;Oncology;Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma;Patient Isolation;Patients;Performance;Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell;Phenotype;Prevention;Procedures;Process;Production;Proliferating;Proteins;Public Health;Receptor Cell;Research;Research Personnel;Retroviral Vector;Signal Transduction;Solid;Solid Neoplasm;Specialist;Speed;System;T-Cell Activation;T-Lymphocyte;Technology;Testing;Therapeutic;Translations;Treatment Efficacy;Viral;Viral Vector;Virus;Visual impairment;Work;barrier to testing;bioscaffold;cancer care;cancer therapy;cellular transduction;chimeric antigen receptor;chimeric antigen receptor T cells;cost;design;engineered T cells;improved;in vivo;innovation;manufacture;manufacturing cost;manufacturing process;mouse model;multidisciplinary;new technology;novel;ovarian neoplasm;pre-clinical;prevent;procedure cost;prototype;response;retroviral transduction;scaffold;success;therapeutic candidate;tool;transcriptome sequencing;transduction efficiency;tumor;tumor growth,Yevgeny Brudno,Ping Guan,117515,117515,2023-08-17T12:08:00Z,2023-08-17T12:08:00Z,2024-06-30T12:06:00Z,RFA-CA-22-004,nofo_RFA-CA-22-004,north carolina state university raleigh,RALEIGH,NC,UNITED STATES,imat,org_name,False
1R44CA118785-01,R44CA118785,7026577,2006,miRNA Profiling in Fixed Cancer Samples,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): During Phase I of our proposed research, we will develop and validate procedures for recovering, labeling, and analyzing miRNAs from fixed tissue samples. The procedures will be based on the miRNA microarray and fixed tissue RNA isolation systems that we developed in other SBIR-funded programs. The development of our miRNA isolation and labeling procedures will be accomplished using a model system wherein mouse organs will be split and half is flash-frozen and the other half formalin-fixed using a procedure that is commonly employed in hospitals. The frozen and fixed samples will be processed to recover the miRNAs. The miRNAs from the fixed and frozen tissues will be independently labeled and analyzed using miRNA microarrays. The isolation, labeling, and hybridization procedures will be varied until the fixed samples yield the same miRNA expression profiles as the equivalent frozen samples. The fixed sample procedures will) then be used to analyze formalin fixed, human tissue samples to analyze miRNA profiles from multiple organs. The fixed tissue miRNA profiles will be compared to the profiles generated from frozen samples to verify that the fixed tissue miRNA profiling process can be used for stored, human fixed tissue samples. During Phase II of our research project, we will use the miRNA isolation, labeling and microarray analysis procedures developed during Phase I to analyze archived, fixed human cancer tissues to identify miRNAs with expression profiles that are significantly different from equivalent, normal tissues. The most interesting miRNAs or miRNA signatures might provide opportunities for diagnostic/prognostic assay development or even an intervention point for therapeutic agents.",human;neoplasm /cancer;tissues,David M Brown,James W.

2R44CA097482-02A1,R44CA097482,6913953,2005,Ultra Rapid Methods for Streamlined Tissue-to-RT-PCR,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Phase II proposal aims to simplify, expedite, and stabilize the recovery of high quality RNA from tissue samples. In Phase I, we demonstrated the feasibility of a hands-off, closed tube tissue disruption method termed ""MELT"" (Multi-Enzymatic Liquefaction of Tissue). MELT enlists potent catabolic enzymes to liquefy tissue within minutes without invasive mechanical force. High yields of intact RNA are obtained after MELT. Importantly, MELT enzymes destroy cellular RNases and stabilize RNA in tissue lysates for up to 5 days at ambient temperatures. Additionally, MELT is compatible with freshly harvested, flash-frozen, or RNAIater(R)-treated tissues, both mouse and human, and including tumor specimens. Taken together, these advances promise faster, simpler, safer, and more robust methods for stabilizing and quantifying gene expression in tissues through innovations in RNA stability, closed-tube tissue disruption, and rapid single-tube sample preparation. In Phase II we will integrate continuing MELT enhancements with new ways to facilitate RNA processing. First, we will accelerate MELT tissue digestions and maximize the quality of the resulting RNA. Second, we will link MELT improvements with novel magnetic beads that can enable the purification of DNA-free RNA in as little as 20 min. This method will secure the recovery of large amounts of RNA for analysis by any expression profiling method, including microarrays. Last, we will enable an ultra rapid RNA sample preparation strategy specifically suited for qRT-PCR (""Tissue-to-RT-PCR"") that skips RNA isolation altogether. Using novel approaches for tissue disruption, RNase control, DNA removal, and the management of RT-PCR inhibition, we will enable Tissue-to-RT-PCR in less than 10 minutes, with all of the steps but the RT-PCR reaction itself occurring in the same tube. Success in these objectives will result in easy-to-use products that offer improved RNA yields, greater sample throughput, more ready automation, and reduced variability, contamination, and biohazard risk compared to current methods. The beneficiaries of MELT technology will include life science researches and clinical diagnostic labs, where emerging RNA biomarkers can be combined with simpler sample preparation methods to hasten the adoption of molecular diagnostics procedures.",RNA;biotechnology;clinical research;endopeptidases;enzymes;gene expression;human tissue;immunomagnetic separation;laboratory mouse;microarray technology;nucleic acid purification;polymerase chain reaction;technology /technique development;temperature;tissue /cell preparation;tissue /organ preservation,Gary J Latham,Rebecca Liddell Huppi,304273,304273,2005-05-03T12:05:00Z,2002-09-27T12:09:00Z,2005-12-31T12:12:00Z,RFA-CA-05-008,nofo_RFA-CA-05-008,"ambion, inc.",AUSTIN,TX,UNITED STATES,imat,org_name,True
2R44CA133987-03,R44CA133987,7692671,2010,Single Molecule Fiber Arrays for the Detection of Low Abundance Proteins,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The aim of this project is to develop a new technology that can be used to detect very low concentrations (femtomolar and below) of proteins that are diagnostic for cancer. Presently, early diagnosis of cancer is limited by the fact that the limits of detections (LOD) of available technologies, such as ELISA, are higher than the circulating concentrations of low abundance proteins that could indicate the onset of disease. This program would broaden and strengthen the use a novel fiber optic array single molecule detection technology for extremely high sensitivity measurement of cancer markers. This technology is digital in nature, i.e., individual molecules are quantified by their presence (""on"" signal) or their absence (""off"" signal). By focusing detection at the single molecule level, dramatic improvements in sensitivity are achieved for proteins. Phase I of this project demonstrated that single molecule detection makes it possible to detect concentrations of proteins at levels a thousand times lower than ELISA. Using single molecule detection, prostate specific antigen (PSA) was detected in serum at concentrations less than 1 femtomolar; current immunoanalyzers have an LOD of about 3 picomolar for PSA. The Phase II project has three specific aims that would build on these proof-of-principal experiments to broaden and strengthen the use of the technique for detection of cancer protein markers, and to move the technology closer to commercialization for use by medical researchers and clinicians. First, the ultra-sensitive PSA assay will be used to detect the marker in human clinical samples, specifically to measure the levels of PSA in prostate cancer patients who have undergone radical prostatectomy. Current technologies cannot detect PSA in these samples; this technology could enable the early detection of the return of PSA in serum, which would indicate residual disease. Second, the technology will be expanded to cover more classes of proteins, such as fusion proteins and post-translational modifications, to enable its broader implementation. Third, methods will be developed to measure panels of proteins at low concentrations using small sample volumes. These panels would enable the diagnosis of difficulty to detect diseases, such as ovarian cancer, with greater sensitivity and specificity. The long term objective of this research is to establish a new standard in high sensitivity detection of biological molecules (proteins, peptides, RNA, cells) using instrumentation that would be widely employed in both academic and clinical laboratories. Such an innovation would enable researchers to detect cancer markers at unprecedented levels for early diagnostic applications, and would facilitate the discovery of new low abundance cancer markers. This long term goal satisfies several aspects of the mission of the NIH, in particular, to develop innovative research strategies towards improving the diagnosis, prevention and cure of human diseases. The early diagnosis of cancer is determined by the ability of the clinical oncologist to detect the disease. Quanterix is proposing to develop a technology that would enable clinicians to detect very low concentrations of proteins in blood and, therefore, enable the early diagnosis of disease. This technology has the potential to help medical researchers and doctors to identify and detect many more early cancer diagnostic markers and improve outcomes for patients.",Area;Biological;Biological Assay;Biological Markers;Biological Models;Blood;Cancer Detection;Cancer Diagnostics;Cancer Patient;Cells;Chimeric Proteins;Clinical;Complex;Computer software;Detection;Diagnosis;Diagnostic;Disease;Early Diagnosis;Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay;Fiber;Fiber Optics;Goals;Human;Immunoassay;Individual;Laboratories;Malignant Neoplasms;Malignant neoplasm of ovary;Malignant neoplasm of prostate;Measurement;Measures;Medical;Methods;Mission;Modification;Molecular;Nature;Oncologist;Onset of illness;Operative Surgical Procedures;Outcome;Patients;Peptides;Phase;Prevention;Prostate specific antigen measurement;Prostate-Specific Antigen;Proteins;Radical Prostatectomy;Reading;Reagent;Reproducibility;Research;Research Personnel;Residual Tumors;Sampling;Sensitivity and Specificity;Serum;Signal Transduction;Techniques;Technology;Time;TimeLine;Translating;United States National Institutes of Health;base;cancer diagnosis;commercialization;digital;human disease;improved;innovation;instrument;instrumentation;meetings;new technology;next generation;novel;programs;protein complex;protein profiling;prototype;research study;single molecule;small molecule,David C Duffy,Patricia A Weber,749935,749935,2010-04-27T12:04:00Z,2008-08-01T12:08:00Z,2013-04-30T12:04:00Z,RFA-CA-08-011,nofo_RFA-CA-08-011,"twin lights bioscience, inc.",CAMBRIDGE,MA,UNITED STATES,imat,org_name,False

4R33CA083220-02,R33CA083220,6583709,2002,FOUR COLOR ARRAY BOUND SNP/MUTATION DETECTION IN CANCER,"DESCRIPTION: (Applicant's Description) Development of cost-effective, high-throughput sampling coupled to rapid, parallel DNA profiling methods will facilitate molecular analysis of normal and diseased states. This R21/R33 initiative focuses on detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and point mutations in cancer. Our goals are as follows: Milestones/Aims for the R21 phase include: 1) Development of a robust, 4-color rhodamine BigDye terminators-based single nucleotide extension (SNE) array assay which will allow DNA TaqFS-catalyzed, single nucleotide extension to detect a wide variety of SNPs/mutations associated with human cancer. We will increase signal intensity as well as eliminate the need for synthesis of costly spacers on array-bound probes by using dendrimer-coated surfaces; and, 2) Scale-up the assay to simultaneously monitor 30-50 SNPs/mutations on a single array. Multiplexing will be done both at PCR and SNE steps and use of total genomic DNA targets will be tested. Strategies will also be implemented to screen multiple individuals on a single chip for the same mutation. Aims for the R33 phase include: 1) Application of SNE assay to type SNPs within and flanking the minimal deleted region in lp, llq and 14q in neuroblastoma pediatric patients. The assay will facilitate identification of deletion location and extent and eventually will facilitate understanding the relationship between genotype and phenotype; and 2) Identification of single-base changes occurring within the mutation cluster region of adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and in sporadic colorectal cancer. We will also evaluate genotype/phenotype relationships using information from SNE-based mutation analyses and results from array-based genome-wide mRNA expression profiles already funded by an NCI Contract. Array-based results generated from Aims 1 and 2 will be compared and contrasted to data available from previously typed individuals using more traditional DNA analysis approaches as well as to solution-phase results generated at PE-Biosystems. Development and validation of array-bound approaches for monitoring DNA changes in cancer should facilitate high throughput, parallel processing of samples for critical human cancer genes. In addition, it will help establish basic knowledge required to rapidly define the molecular basis of specific malignancies and eventually provide a foundation for rational molecular assessment of therapeutic.",adenomatous polyps; biotechnology; clinical research; colorectal neoplasms; diagnostic tests; fluorescent dye /probe; genetic polymorphism; high throughput technology; human subject; microarray technology; neoplasm /cancer genetics; neuroblastoma; point mutation; polymerase chain reaction,Paolo M Fortina,Kelly Y.

4R33CA083232-03,R33CA083232,6739927,2003,APTAMER BASED DETECTOR TO QUANTIFY MACROMOLECULES,"DESCRIPTION: (Applicant's Description) We propose to develop a technology to simultaneously detect and quantify large numbers individual proteins and post-translationally modified proteins. This technology will be based on a spatially-arrayed aptamer microchip and sensitive fluorescence-based optical detection techniques. The system will provide a powerful new tool for biomedical research and diagnosis of diseases and cancers. Currently, the levels of cellular proteins are inferred from cellular mRNA levels by using DNA oligonucleotide microchips. These microchips allow the detection of mRNA levels by base-pairing interactions to homologous DNA oligomers located at different sites in the microchip array. However, this indirect assay of protein levels suffers from two problems: First, mRNA levels may not accurately reflect the level of encoded protein because translation and degradation rates vary from protein to protein and are regulated in response to cell physiology. Second, post-translational modifications proteins often alter critical protein activities. This technology we propose to develop is comprised of three parts: 1) Aptamers with high-affinity and high-specifity for individual proteins. These aptamers will be designed to have ligand-dependent changes in fluorescence properties. 2) A microchip array with each array site occupied by aptamers against a different target molecule. 3) An evanescent field fluorescence detector which detects target molecules binding to aptamers at the array sites. Our proposal includes plans for: 1) selection of aptamers that can discriminate between different post-translational modifications of the same protein; 2) development of fluorescence-based techniques for detecting oligonucleotide:protein interactions; 3) design and construction of an optimized fluorescence detector; 4) scaling up methods to allow large numbers of independent aptamer selections against different proteins; 5) construction of a prototype protein chip.",macromolecule; messenger RNA; microprocessor /microchip; oligonucleotides; posttranslational modifications; proteins; technology /technique development,Andrew D Ellington,John R Knowlton,93033,93033,,2003-06-01T12:06:00Z,2004-05-31T12:05:00Z,PAR-99-100,nofo_PAR-99-100,archemix corporation,CAMBRIDGE,MA,UNITED STATES,imat,org_name,False
4R33CA088343-03,R33CA088343,6573328,2002,FLUORESCENT TAGS TARGETED ON CELL SURFACE CARBOHYDRATES,"Malignant transformation is often associated with alteration of cell surface carbohydrates. The expression or over-expression of certain carbohydrates, such as sialyl Lewis X (sLex), sialyl Lewis a (sLea), Lewis X (Lex) and Lewis Y (Ley), has been correlated with the development of certain cancers. These cell surface carbohydrates can be used for cell-specific identification and targeting of carcinoma cells. The long-term goal of this project is the development of small molecule artificial receptors which can recognize target carbohydrate structures with high selectivity and affinity. Such receptors could be used for the development of fluorescent tags for cell- specific identification, tissue-specific imaging (such as MRI), and targeted delivery of therapeutic agents. In this study, we will use sLex as the model carbohydrate and use colon cancer as the model biological system because the expression of sLex is often associated with progression and metastasis of colon cancer. The short-term objective of this application is to develop tissue-specific fluorescent tags (sensors) which can recognize sLex with high affinity and selectivity. For the construction of such fluorescent sensors, we plan to use an integrated approach combining template-directed synthesis, combinatorial chemistry, and computer molecular modeling aided design. The sLex-specific artificial receptors have the potential to be used for cell identification, detection and tagging for the purpose of localization, staging, tissue biopsy, and fluorescence-directed surgical removal of colon cancer cells. Such tissue-specific compounds could also serve as vehicles for targeted delivery of cancer chemotherapeutic agents. These small molecule sensors may also have the following advantages over antibody-based detection/delivery systems: (1) greater stability during storage and in vivo; (2) increased permeability through biological membranes and, therefore, enhanced target accessibility; (3) intrinsic sensitivity to binding with significant fluorescence intensity increases, making detection and visualization easier and more suitable for high throughout screening, and (4) lower propensity to elicit undesirable immune responses.

4R33CA092752-02,R33CA092752,7249869,2006,Fast Mutation Detection by Tandem SSCP/HA on Microchips,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is proposed to optimize, evaluate, and pilot rapid, scalable, and low-cost microchip electrophoresis technologies for sensitive and specific molecular detection of cancer by tandem single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP)/heteroduplex analysis (HA), using the p53 gene as a model system. We request a 1-year R21 phase and a 3-year R33 phase. The proposed project involves collaboration between members of Northwestern's Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center, including researchers in Chemical Engineering, the Medical School, and Evanston Hospital. Microchannel ""tandem"" SSCP/HA is a novel mutation detection method recently developed in our laboratory, which involves the simultaneous generation and analysis of homo/heteroduplex DNA and SSCP conformers. Studies of a significant number of samples (32) indicate that tandem SSCP/HA allows for much higher-sensitivity mutation detection (100%) than SSCP alone (93%) or HA alone (75%), for p53 samples. We have developed and published optimized sample preparation protocols, gel formulations, and analysis conditions for capillary array electrophoresis (CAE). During the R21 phase, we will translate these methods to microfluidic electrophoresis chips, which offer a large increase in throughput and drop in cost of DNA analysis compared to CAE. The p53 gene, known to be mutated in >50% of human cancers, and whose mutation status can be predictive of patient response to chemotherapy, is the important model system chosen. However, microchip-based genetic analysis technologies to be developed should be easily applied to ANY cancer-related gene. In the R21 phase, we will analyze approximately 60 different DNA samples derived from tumor cell lines, representing a range of mutations in different p53 exons, to determine the impact of DNA sample characteristics and electrophoresis protocols on the sensitivity and specificity of the method, in a blinded study designed by collaborating biostatisticians. When optimized tandem SSCP/HA protocols have been developed for microchips, they will be piloted by the analysis of >200 selected samples amplified from frozen, solid tumors banked at Evanston Hospital. Via this blinded study, sensitivity and specificity (both expected to be at or near 100%) will be determined and reported for the first time using banked tumor tissue, providing necessary validation for clinical application of this technique, and making rapid, low-cost cancer genotyping technology widely available to physicians.",DNA;capillary electrophoresis;clinical research;cooperative study;diagnosis design /evaluation;diagnosis quality /standard;gene mutation;genotype;high throughput technology;immunocytochemistry;neoplasm /cancer diagnosis;nucleic acid quantitation /detection;nucleic acid sequence;p53 gene /protein;polymerase chain reaction;rapid diagnosis;single strand conformation polymorphism;statistics /biometry,Annelise Emily Barron,Avraham Rasooly,235917,235917,2006-07-25T12:07:00Z,2003-09-12T12:09:00Z,2009-05-31T12:05:00Z,PAR-01-106,nofo_PAR-01-106,northwestern university,EVANSTON,IL,UNITED STATES,imat,org_name,False
4R33CA094340-02,R33CA094340,6869198,2004,Identification of serum glycosylation markers of HCC,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) (and/or hepatitis C virus) is the major etiology of hepatocellular cancer (HCC). In the United States, chronic hepatitis B and C account for about 30%- 40% of HCC and, worldwide, more than 350 million people are chronically infected with either HBV or HCV. Alteration in the oligosaccharides associated with glycoproteins and glycolipids is one of the many molecular changes that accompany malignant transformations. However, accurate and reliable detection and quantification of oligosaccharides has been technically very difficult or time consuming. It is well established that in HCC there is an elevation in the amount of fucosylated oligosaccharides associated with a-fetal protein (AFP). The increase of a l-6-fucosylated glycans is due, in part, to an abnormal secretion system and other proteins have been shown to be aberrantly glycosylated. However, no systematic analysis has been carried out to identify all the proteins that have an increase in fucosylation. Our hypothesis is that by combining our high throughput oligosaccharide sequencing methodology with our laboratory's proteome expertise, we will be able to use lectin extraction methods to purify and identify fucosylated glycoproteins from HCC sera. Hence, proof of principle experiments will be carried out in the R21 phase using cultured liver cells to demonstrate the utility of the technology; while in the R33 phase the technology will be evaluated in a pilot study using sera obtained from woodchuck, a well established animal model of HBV induced HCC. It is anticipated that this methodology will allow the identification of an array of molecules that show increased fucosylation in HCC. These proteins may be then further evaluated as members of a fucose index to act as a surrogate marker for HCC progression. Obviously the technology would be applicable to any cancer system where oligosaccharide changes are associated with development to neoplasia.",Hepadnaviridae;alpha fetoprotein;biomarker;cancer risk;fucose;gel electrophoresis;glycolipids;glycoproteins;glycosylation;hepatitis B virus group;hepatocellular carcinoma;high performance liquid chromatography;high throughput technology;lectin;mass spectrometry;oligosaccharides;protein purification;protein structure function;serum;tissue /cell culture,Anand S.

4R33CA105514-02,R33CA105514,7085601,2005,Assaying Tyrosine Kinase Activity: A New Paradigm,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): New approaches are needed in the molecular analyses of the growth-promoting signal transduction pathways involved in the development and maintenance of cancer. The Laser Micropipet System (LMS), a new technology for the biochemical assay of kinases, holds the promise of directly assaying the activities of protein tyrosine kinases in primary patient cells. The LMS was developed for the assay of serine/threonine kinases in individual cells grown in tissue culture. This R21/R33 application proposes to expand the applications of this instrumentation to directly determine the activity of oncogenic tyrosine kinases in primary cells from patients. Assay of Bcr-Abl in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) will demonstrate the power of this tool for research, clinical, and pharmacologic applications. While this assay will be of value in the study of the biology and resistance mechanisms in CML, the studies will lay the groundwork for a new paradigm in the study of molecular mechanisms in cancer signal transduction and will have general applicability. The R21 phase of this proposal is designed to establish the feasibility of assaying Bcr-Abl activity and to demonstrate the necessary assay conditions for measurements in cells derived from a patient with CML. The specific aims are to: 1) identify and characterize a reporter of intracellular Bcr-Ab1 kinase activity, 2) define and optimize conditions for measuring Bcr-Ab1 activity in human cells, 3) compare reporter phosphorylation in cells expressing Bcr-Ab1 vs. cells lacking this kinase, and 4) demonstrate the feasibility of using primary patient cells in kinase assays. The goal of the R33 phase is to demonstrate the potential for the LMS-based kinase assay in applications for the study of the biology of pharmacologic resistance in CML, including from primary patient cells. The R33 specific aims are to: 1) develop a membrane-permeant Bcr-Ab1 kinase reporter, 2) demonstrate the ability to detect imatinib resistance in CML cell lines, 3) determine Bcr-Ab1 activity in primary cells from patients with CML and their response to pharmacologic inhibition, and 4) determine if the assay can detect the emergence of imatinib resistance in CML patients and can differentiate the mechanisms of drug resistance.",biological signal transduction;capillary electrophoresis;carcinogenesis;cell growth regulation;chronic myelogenous leukemia;clinical research;enzyme activity;enzyme mechanism;gene expression;human subject;intracellular;neoplastic cell;oncoproteins;phosphorylation;protein purification;protein tyrosine kinase;reporter genes;single cell analysis;technology /technique development,Christopher E Sims,Min-Kyung H Song,481662,481662,2005-08-08T12:08:00Z,2005-08-08T12:08:00Z,2008-07-31T12:07:00Z,PAR-01-106,nofo_PAR-01-106,university of california-irvine,IRVINE,CA,UNITED STATES,imat,org_name,False
4R33CA107943-02,R33CA107943,7194502,2006,A Novel Proteomics Technology for Protein Farnesylation,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The identification and characterization of changes in the level of farnesylated proteins in response to the treatment of farnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTIs), a newly introduced family of antitumor agents currently undergoing clinical evaluation, represents a major scientific challenge. Extant proteomics methods are limited to quantifying a few thousands of the most abundant proteins and, therefore, are unsuitable for the targeted profiling of less abundant farnesylated expression. The major goal of this application is to develop and validate a powerful technology, Tagging via Azido Substrate (TAS), for the efficient isolation of farnesylated proteins. This technology will then be applied to the proteomics analysis of farnesylated proteins in physiologically relevant models. The TAS technology involves the introduction of a synthetic azide-modified farnesyl substrate, either farnesyl azide diphosphate (FPP-azide) or farnesyl azide alcohol (F-azide-OH), which replaces the natural substrate during cellular protein farnesylation. The resulting farnesyl-azide (F-azide)-modified proteins will be affinity-purified through an azide-specific conjugation reaction (Staudinger reaction) using a phosphine capture reagent linked to photo-cleavable beads, which can then be released by UV light-induced photo-cleavage. Since affinity purification relies on covalent bonding resulting from a specific conjugation reaction between an azide and phosphine capture reagent, other proteins without the F-azide modification can be effectively removed by thorough washing. Thus, the TAS technology will allow farnesylated proteins to be isolated with high yield, high specificity, and low contamination. The initial focus of the R21 portion of this proposal is on the development of TAS technology and its application to the isolation of farnesylated proteins. These studies will be extended subsequently to geranylgeranylated proteins. The R33 proposal will aim at applications of the TAS technology to the identification of novel FTI targets. These studies will provide fundamental information for the understanding of molecular mechanisms of FTI functions and are likely to identify novel targets for antitumor drug design.",,Yingming Zhao,John R Knowlton,506055,506055,2006-04-07T12:04:00Z,2004-06-07T12:06:00Z,2009-03-31T12:03:00Z,PAR-01-104,nofo_PAR-01-104,ut southwestern medical center,DALLAS,TX,UNITED STATES,imat,org_name,False
4R33CA114149-02,R33CA114149,7281787,2006,Imaging tumor associated fibroblast activation protein,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this research is to develop a novel fibroblast activation protein (FAP) sensing near infrared fluorescence reporter for early tumor detection and tumor classification. FAP is a cell surface antigen of reactive tumor stromal fibroblasts founded in more than 90% of epithelial carcinomas, but it is absent from epithelial carcinoma cells, normal fibroblasts, and other normal human tissue. Supporting tumor stromal fibroblasts are generally localized close to tumor vasculature, which is essential for early tumor development and growth. Thus it has been chosen as a target for monoclonal antibody based tumor therapy. FAP is not only a membrane protein but also a dipeptidyl peptidase. An imaging probe to report enzymatic activity and location of FAP could be extremely useful for early tumor detection. In this application we will develop a small molecular probe with ultra-sensitivity based on a unique class of fluorogenic chromophore that has significant changes in emission at different chemical states. Specifically, the probes emit no fluorescence in their initial intact state but become brightly fluorescent after specific proteolytic reaction. The newly developed low molecular weight, well defined fluorogenic probes are expected to have several advantages for imaging: a) fast tissue distribution allowing earlier imaging after injection, b) fast clearance allowing repeated imaging, and c) high likelihood of developing key candidates into clinically useful agents. The choice of FAP is based on its importance in tumor growth, invasion, and other processes in oncogenesis. Together with recent developments in fluorescence imaging technologies, this research is expected to ultimately result in clinical imaging agents with specificity for targeted enzymes. We believe that the developed approach can be used as a platform to design a broad spectrum of activatable molecular probes to image other amino peptidases in vivo.",aminopeptidase;athymic mouse;bioimaging /biomedical imaging;chemical synthesis;colon neoplasms;enzyme activity;enzyme induction /repression;fibroblasts;fluorescent dye /probe;ionophores;molecular /cellular imaging;molecular probes;neoplasm /cancer diagnosis;neoplasm /cancer transplantation;peptidyl dipeptidase;technology /technique development,Ching-Hsuan Tung,James W.

In addition, refinement of conjugation methods of nanoporous particles will allow selective targeting of endothelial cells in vitro and tumor-associated blood vessels in vivo and in combination with refinement of loading strategies, cytotoxic agents loaded into nanoparticles can selectively destroy these vessels. Our experimental plan is based on our expertise in development and refinement of emerging nanotechnology approaches for protein capture, for selective targeting and loading of silicon nanoparticles. These studies also take advantage of our experience in identification of novel proteins within the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family of proteins that are essential in the process of tumor-associated angiogenesis. To achieve the goal of developing and refining tools for detection of angiogenic proteins and for selective targeting and destruction of tumor-associated blood vessels, the following Specific Aims are proposed: 1. Develop and refine silica chips with nanocharacteristics to enhance the sensitivity of LC-MS/MS identification VEGF proteins in serum and in skin tumors during skin tumor-associated angiogenesis in vivo; 2. Refine conjugation of silicon nanoparticles to anti-VEGFR-2 receptor antibodies for selective targeting of endothelial cells in vitro and targeting tumor-associated blood vessels in vivo; 3. Determine the ability of silicon nanoparticles conjugated with anti-VEGFR-2 antibodies to be loaded with and to deliver the cytotoxic agent melatin for destruction of endothelial cells in vitro and for destruction of tumor-associated blood vessels in vivo. These studies will provide sensitive nanotechnology tools that are critical in defining the proteome in serum and tumors related to tumor angiogenesis that is currently unexplored.

The procedures will be based on the miRNA microarray and fixed tissue RNA isolation systems that we developed in other SBIR-funded programs. The development of our miRNA isolation and labeling procedures will be accomplished using a model system wherein mouse organs will be split and half is flash-frozen and the other half formalin-fixed using a procedure that is commonly employed in hospitals. The frozen and fixed samples will be processed to recover the miRNAs. The miRNAs from the fixed and frozen tissues will be independently labeled and analyzed using miRNA microarrays. The isolation, labeling, and hybridization procedures will be varied until the fixed samples yield the same miRNA expression profiles as the equivalent frozen samples. The fixed sample procedures will) then be used to analyze formalin fixed, human tissue samples to analyze miRNA profiles from multiple organs. The fixed tissue miRNA profiles will be compared to the profiles generated from frozen samples to verify that the fixed tissue miRNA profiling process can be used for stored, human fixed tissue samples. During Phase II of our research project, we will use the miRNA isolation, labeling and microarray analysis procedures developed during Phase I to analyze archived, fixed human cancer tissues to identify miRNAs with expression profiles that are significantly different from equivalent, normal tissues.

The assay proposed relies on an electro catalytic process involving two transition-metal ions that reports on biomolecular complexation events. Because the reporter system responds to changes in the electrostatics of an electrode surface, it will enable the analysis of nucleic acids/protein and peptide/protein complexes. The proposed project has 3 specific aims: 1) electro catalytic detection of DNA repair proteins implicated in cancer using DNA-modified electrodes; 2) optimization of electro catalytic detection and multiplexed analysis of cellular DNA repair activities, and 3) development of a generalized electro catalytic protein detection method using prostate cancer biomarkers. The electro catalytic protein detection system described is advantageous because it will allow the analysis and discrimination of multiprotein complexes in addition to uncomplexed analytes and will have high selectivity and specificity. Additionally, the protein detection assays will be conducted using nanoelectrodes that will allow multiplexed detection of panels of different biomolecular targets.",DNA binding protein;DNA repair;biomarker;biotechnology;carbonates;electrochemistry;electrodes;high throughput technology;nanotechnology;oligonucleotides;prostate neoplasms;prostate specific antigen;protein quantitation /detection;synthetic nucleotide;technology /technique development,Shana O Kelley,John R Knowlton,45407,45407,2006-08-29T12:08:00Z,2005-06-21T12:06:00Z,2006-12-15T12:12:00Z,RFA-CA-05-002,nofo_RFA-CA-05-002,boston college,CHESTNUT HILL,MA,UNITED STATES,imat,org_name,False
5R21CA114852-02,R21CA114852,7077713,2006,Profile serum proteins by glycopeptide capture and LC-MS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancers develop over a period of several years and they are characterized by molecular changes prior to invasion and metastasis. Development of a technology that enables screening of cancer from body fluids could permit cancer detection at early and treatable stages. It is expected that the composition of the serum proteome contains valuable information about the state of the human body in health and disease, and that this information can be extracted via quantitative proteomic measurements. Suitable proteomic techniques need to be sensitive, reproducible and robust, to detect potential biomarkers below the level of highly expressed proteins, to generate data sets that are comparable between experiments and laboratories, and have high throughput to support studies with sufficient statistical power. In this proposal, we will develop a method for high throughput quantitative analysis of serum proteins. It consists of the selective isolation of the peptides that are N-linked glycosylated in the intact protein using solid-phase extraction of glycopeptides (SPEG) on a robotic workstation, the analysis of these now de-glycosylated peptides by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS), and the comparative analysis of the resulting patterns. By focusing selectively on a few formerly N-linked glycopeptides per serum protein, the complexity of the analyte sample is significantly reduced, and the sensitivity, reproducibility, and throughput of serum proteome analysis are increased compared with the analysis of total tryptic peptides from unfractionated samples. We will explore the feasibility to identify cancer-specific serum proteins in the background of normal variation using a carcinogen-induced skin cancer mouse model. The specific aims are: 1) To develop chemistries and protocols for an automatic robotic system to isolate N-linked glycopeptides from serum in a high throughput and highly reproducible fashion; 2) To develop efficient and reproducible procedures for LC-MS analyses, and sequence identification of discriminatory peptides by tandem mass spectrometry; 3) To explore the feasibility of this method for the identification of distinctive serum peptides specific to cancer-bearing mice in the background of normal variations. If successful, the proposed research could subsequently be used for profiling human serum samples from cancer patients and normal individuals to identify the cancer-associated proteins in serum. The identified biomarkers will open a new paradigm for performing screening and detection of human cancer at early stage and for clinical therapeutic management.",biomarker;biomedical automation;biotechnology;blood proteins;glycopeptides;high throughput technology;laboratory mouse;liquid chromatography mass spectrometry;neoplasm /cancer diagnosis;proteomics;technology /technique development,Hui Zhang,John R Knowlton,50219,50219,2006-06-01T12:06:00Z,2005-06-13T12:06:00Z,2006-11-30T12:11:00Z,RFA-CA-05-002,nofo_RFA-CA-05-002,institute for systems biology,SEATTLE,WA,UNITED STATES,imat,org_name,False
5R21CA116060-02,R21CA116060,7140157,2006,REVERSIBLE PROMOTER-INSERTION FOR IN VIVO STUDIES OF MELANOMA,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is commonly accepted that the processes underlying the development of cancer are best modeled in vivo. A plethora of methods have been developed for genetic dissection of biological processes in somatic cells in culture; however, the adaptation of these techniques to in vivo use has been very limited. Our earlier experience indicates that reversible promoter-insertion mutagenesis offers a number of advantages over the currently used forward genetics techniques for cultured cells. The most important benefits are the dominant nature of the mutations, and the ease of identifying the affected gene and establishing the causal link between the mutation and the phenotype. The principal limitation for the adaptation of this technique to in vivo studies is the delivery of the insertional mutagen (typically, a retroviral vector) to the desired cell type. Based on our recent experience and published data from others, we propose a method to circumvent this limitation via the use of specially engineered transposon vectors. We propose to apply our technique to study the genetic events underlying melanoma development. We will screen for genetic events that cooperate with oncogenic Ras (commonly found in melanomas) in this process. We will confirm the properties of the proposed insertional mutagens in culture and then proceed to establish mouse strains suitable for mutagenesis. Upon verifying the properties of our constructs in vivo, we will selectively mutagenize melanocytes in transgenic animals and will test the functional link between tumorigenesis and the inserted promoter. Confirmed hits will be the subject of future investigation, while the technique itself will become available for dissection of various biological phenomena in general and aspects of tumorigenesis, in particular.",biomarker;biotechnology;cell line;gene mutation;genetically modified animals;guanine nucleotide binding protein;laboratory mouse;melanocyte;melanoma;neoplasm /cancer genetics;oncogenes;technology /technique development;tetracyclines;tissue /cell culture;transfection /expression vector;transposon /insertion element,Eugene S Kandel,Jennifer A.

5R21CA118632-02,R21CA118632,7459633,2008,Defining the Multiple Myeloma Kinome,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gene profiling technology has enabled analysis of the transcriptome and proteome of tumor cells. This information has provided useful information with regard to molecular mechanisms that define the enhanced survival and proliferation of MM cells. However, an equally, if not more important, goal is to define those proteins that participate in signaling pathways active in MM cells and their supporting stroma. Enzymes that phosphorylate tyrosine, serins and threonine residues on other proteins play a major role in signaling cascades that determine cell cycle entry and survival in MM and the stromal cells that support them. In particular, knowing the signaling pathways that are active in MM cells and their supporting stroma will provide critical information for understanding MM cell survival in the BM. We have developed and are applying to purified cells a novel array-based strategy that allows the simultaneous detection of phosphorylation for 1152 different kinase substrates. Here we propose to apply this emerging technology to the analysis of phosphorylation-based cell signaling pathways in MM and their supporting stroma. This R21/R33 Phased Innovation application will be pursued in two phases. In the R21 phase of this application Aims 1 and 2 will validate that PepChip technology can be applied to MM cells and their microenvironment to reveal signaling alterations in MM. In Aim 3 of the R33 phase we will use PepChip technology to identify kinome alterations within the MM patient population that are correlated with clinical parameters such as relapse and chromosomal abnormalities associated with poor prognosis. In Aim 4 we will utilize an in vivo model that supports the growth of primary patient isolates in RAG2XGammaC mice to determine the effect of therapeutics on the kinome of MM cells.

5R21CA123018-02,R21CA123018,7295672,2007,Epigenetic Targeting in Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hypermethylation of promoter CpG islands plays a prominent role in cancer. In partnership with alterations in histone acetylation/methylation, this epigenetic event establishes a repressive chromatin structure that leads to silencing of key cancer-related genes. The occurrence of DNA methylation within the genome is not random, but rather patterns of methylation are generated that are gene and tumor type specific. How DNA methylation patterns are established is still poorly understood. Since various transcriptional factors or regulators are found in association with DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) in vivo, we hypothesize that: 1) Oncogenic transcription factors can recruit DNMTs to target gene promoters and define a unique epigenetic signature in tumor cells; 2) Dissecting such complex epigenetic hierarchy will identify novel molecular targets for diagnosis, prognosis and therapeutic intervention. To test our hypothesis, we developed a high throughput technique for genome wide analysis of DNA methylation associated with specific proteins such as histones, transcription factors or any DNA binding proteins. The new approach named ChlP-Chop-DMH will combine both genome wide location analysis (also known as ChlP-on-Chip) and Differential Methylation Hybridization (DMH) analysis, two emerging technologies used in epigenetic research. The proposed method has distinct advantages over current protocols: first, this method directly examines the in vivo interaction of specific proteins with methylated DNA throughout the genome; second, this method may uncover novel biological properties of transcription factors; third, this method can be applied to discover novel epigenetic biomarkers relevant to tumorigenesis. In preliminary studies, we have verified the utility of this method with methylated histone H3 at lysine 9 and lysine 4 in human cancer cells. In the R21 phase, we will continue minor refinement of the method and pursue three aims: 1) Improve and optimize the ChlP-Chop-DMH method for analyzing genome wide association of DNA methylation with histone modification; 2) Utilize the proposed method to investigate the association of DNA methylation with chromatin remodeling factors: 3) Show proof-of-concept using the array to examine primary non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHLs). In this development phase we will focus on the sensitivity, reproducibility and accuracy of the proposed method. In the R33 phase, our goal is to utilize the technology to test biological hypotheses. We will fully implement the method and pursue these aims: 1) Discover epigenetic target genes associated with known oncogenic transcription factors c-Myc and BCL6: 2) Validate the identified epigenetic targets and investigate the regulatory role of the associated oncogenic transcription factors.

5R21CA125398-02,R21CA125398,7493071,2008,The Kinomes of Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gene profiling technology has enabled analysis of the transcriptome and proteome of tumor cells. In fact, massively parallel analysis of the Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) transcriptome has revealed discrete gene profile signatures for the major subtypes of NHL, diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and follicular lymphoma (FL). This information has provided useful insights into molecular mechanisms that promote enhanced survival and proliferation in NHL. However, an equally, if not more important goal, is to define those proteins that participate in signaling pathways active in lymphoma cells and non-malignant cells that infiltrate these tumors. Enzymes that phosphorylate tyrosine, serine and threonine residues on other proteins play a major role in signaling cascades that control cell cycle entry, survival, angiogenesis and the immune response. Defining how these signaling pathways are altered in NHL B cells and non- malignant cells present in these tumors will provide critical information for understanding how lymphoma survives, proliferates and interacts with other cells at the tumor site. We are applying to purified tumor cells a novel array strategy that allows the simultaneous detection of phosphorylation for 1152 different kinase substrates. Here we propose to apply this emerging technology to the analysis of phosphorylation-based cell signaling pathways in NHL. This proposal will be pursued in two phases. The R21 phase will consist of two aims that will validate PepChip technology can identify kinome alterations in primary DLBCL (Aim 1) and FL (Aim 2) isolates. The R33 phase will consist of two aims that will define kinome alterations in DLBCL (Aim 3) and FL (Aim 4) that correlate with clinical parameters.

5R21CA132806-02,R21CA132806,7609116,2009,Standardized NanoArray PCR for Gene Expression Profiling of Lung Cancer,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Molecular characterization of cancer, in particular by gene transcription profiling, has great potential to improve prognosis, therapeutic selection and clinical outcomes. However, the potential for using expression signatures for cancer prognosis and treatment selection is hampered by lack of readily deployable test kits with the accuracy, low RNA requirement and inter-site concordance required for routine clinical use. We propose an innovative solution based on two well-validated PCR technologies whose combination uniquely addresses the problem of diagnostic assay reproducibility. Our plan is to implement Standardized RT (StaRT)-PCR, a proven competitive PCR method developed at the University of Toledo, in a novel nanofluidic PCR platform developed by BioTrove Inc. in order to streamline the fluidic workflow, improve measurement throughput, and at the same time reduce test cost and maintain low RNA input. As compared to existing hybridization or real-time qPCR approaches, Standardized NanoArray PCR (SNAP) will provide the same dynamic range and quality as RT-PCR, yet require less RNA input and be more readily clinically deployable. The development will entail step-wise integration of proven technologies. First, real-time qPCR TaqMan assays will be developed for 16 lung tumor prognostic genes. These assays will be converted to StaRT-PCR by creation of competitive template and a competitor specific dye-labeled probe. Adding a pre-amplification step to StaRT-PCR will reduce the RNA input requirements to enable thousands of tests per sample. Finally, moving the assays into the OpenArray nano-PCR plate will streamline fluid handling. Using RNA isolated from lung clinical tumor resections, dynamic range and precision equivalent to real-time qPCR will be demonstrated for the integrated platform. After the initial development phase is complete, we will compare SNAP and real time qPCR in two critical gene expression profiling experiments. First we will compare the minimum amount of RNA required for each method by monitoring loss of precision as a function of decreasing RNA sample input.

5R21CA137689-03,R21CA137689,7796888,2010,Massively Parallel Sequencing Technology for Cancer Epigenome.,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Methylated CpG island amplification (MCA) is a DNA library construction technique that permits amplification of 146,148 methylated CpG rich regions throughout the whole genome, covering 76% of all genes and 70% of all bona fide CpG islands. When coupled with microarrays, this technique has proven to be highly specific and very useful for the high-throughput analysis of genome-wide methylation in normal and cancer cells. Problems such as non-uniform probe performance, cross-reactivity, difficulties of normalization, and issues of relevant controls, however, prevent the full quantitative potential of MCA from being realized. We propose to develop and validate a high-resolution tool for DNA methylation profiling by coupling MCA with 'next generation' Solexa 1G sequencing technology (MCA-Seq). During the R21 phase of the project, we will apply various strategies to optimize MCA-Seq to improve coverage and minimize the quantity of initial DNA required. Additionally, we will build quality controls for MCA-Seq and develop optimized algorithms for data analysis. We will then validate our optimized MCA-Seq protocols, and evaluate the sensitivity, specificity, and quantitative accuracy using an innovative approach that simulates biological variation in methylation. Our proposed research will result in the development of a simple, robust, and reliable genome-wide assay for DNA methylation which will have broad utility in cancer research. Our long term goal is to utilize this technology to test biological hypotheses. Therefore, in an R33 phase of this project, we plan to fully implement this emerging technology by applying MCA-Seq in a set of well characterized tumor cell lines and primary cancer patient samples. These future studies will further validate the ability of MCA-Seq to accurately profile highly variable and aberrant cancer epigenomes, and generate preliminary biological data. The development and validation of MCA-Seq will enable major advances in our understanding of the basic biological mechanisms that contribute to cancer, and likely contribute to the design of future cancer therapies.",Aberrant DNA Methylation;Address;Algorithms;Biological;Biological Assay;Biological Testing;Cancer Detection;Cancer Patient;Cancer Prognosis;Cancer cell line;Colon;Coupled;Coupling;CpG Islands;DNA;DNA Library;DNA Methylation;Data;Data Analyses;Development;Emerging Technologies;Environmental Exposure;Epigenetic Process;Future;Gene Mutation;Gene Silencing;Genes;Genome;Goals;Hematologic Neoplasms;Human;Libraries;Liver;Malignant Neoplasms;Measures;Methods;Methylation;National Cancer Institute;Neoplasms;Patients;Performance;Phase;Primary Neoplasm;Protocols documentation;Quality Control;Research;Resolution;Sampling;Sensitivity and Specificity;Simulate;Specificity;Specimen;Techniques;Technology;Time;Tumor Cell Line;Validation;Variant;anticancer research;cancer cell;cancer therapy;cost;cross reactivity;design;drug discovery;genome-wide;high throughput analysis;improved;innovation;insight;next generation;prevent;promoter;response;single molecule;tool;tumor;tumorigenesis,Lanlan Shen,Jerry Li,173385,173385,2010-03-29T12:03:00Z,2009-04-01T12:04:00Z,2013-03-31T12:03:00Z,RFA-CA-08-007,nofo_RFA-CA-08-007,baylor college of medicine,HOUSTON,TX,UNITED STATES,imat,org_name,False
5R21CA138333-03,R21CA138333,8516466,2013,Methods of systematic microRNA target validation and identification,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is well known that microRNAs could play a fundamental role in regulation of diverse cellular functions. As key gene regulators, microRNAs work through a posttranscriptional repression mechanism. Increasing evidence indicates that deregulation of microRNA expression could lead to a variety of disorders including human cancer. Although significant progress has been made in the past years in discovery of microRNAs and their biogenesis, and their role in many cellular phenotypes, it is not fully understood how microRNAs exert their cellular functions because a single microRNA can have hundreds of targets. Hence, identification of microRNA targets is a critical step toward understanding of molecular mechanisms of microRNA-mediated gene expression in normal and disease processes. Currently, this largely relies on computer-aided algorithms, which unfortunately are still unable to provide a precise picture of microRNA regulatory networks, and thus the predicted targets need further experimental validations. It is evident that target validation is a bottle neck in our effort to dissect microRNA pathways. In this application, we propose to develop a novel selection method for microRNA target validation and identification through two complementary approaches. The first approach is to determine microRNA/mRNA interactions using our pre-microRNA collection against a specific target cloned in our selection plasmid; the second approach is to determine microRNA/mRNA interactions using a 3'-UTR (untranslated region) library against a specific microRNA. We believe that our selection method is innovative, simple and powerful. An additional benefit of this method will allow us to determine whether there are any new features, besides the seed sequence homology, which could contribute to the specificity of microRNA targeting. Accordingly, this study will greatly enhance our understanding of microRNA targeting and gene regulation by providing a valuable research tool.",Algorithms;Biogenesis;Cell physiology;Collection;Complementary DNA;Computer Assisted;Databases;Disease;Functional RNA;Gene Expression;Gene Expression Regulation;Gene Targeting;Genes;Human;Lead;Learning;Libraries;Malignant Neoplasms;Mediating;Messenger RNA;Methods;MicroRNAs;Molecular;Neck;Normal Cell;Pathway interactions;Phenotype;Plasmids;Play;Process;Regulation;Regulator Genes;Repression;Research;Role;Science;Seeds;Sequence Homology;Source;Specificity;System;Technology;Testing;Translational Repression;Untranslated Regions;Validation;Work;base;human disease;innovation;mRNA Transcript Degradation;novel;research study;success;tool,Yin-Yuan Mo,Jerry Li,174960,174960,2013-06-25T12:06:00Z,2011-07-01T12:07:00Z,2015-06-30T12:06:00Z,RFA-CA-10-005,nofo_RFA-CA-10-005,university of mississippi med ctr,JACKSON,MS,UNITED STATES,imat,org_name,False

However, the translation of fundamental epigenomic insight to the clinic is wrought with challenges. Take for example the study of post-translational histone protein modifications, which can serve to either promote or repress the transcription of pendant DNA sequences. Analyses of these critically important interactions bridge genomics and proteomics and present significant challenges in the clinical setting. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) is the method of choice for analyzing protein-DNA interactions and the basic method involves fragmentation of chromatin, separation of modified proteins using antibodies and magnetic beads, and subsequent analysis of the associated DNA by qPCR or sequencing. While sounding simple, a typical ChIP workflow involves ~30 steps, takes 4+ days, and requires 106-107 cells as input. These requirements significantly limit the applicability of ChIP in a clinical setting-particularly when minimal sampl is available, such as in the analysis of tumor biopsies, stem cells, or circulating tumor cells. Microfluidic devices offer many attractive benefits over traditional macro-scale methods including reduced volume requirements, parallelization capability, and automated operation, which make them particularly well- suited to sample-constrained epigenetic analyses. A handful of recent reports suggest a substantial opportunity for microfluidically-enabled ChIP analyses; however, there is still considerable room for further improvement. We propose to develop a powerful and versatile, droplet microfluidics-based, nanoliter-scale Chromatin ImmunoCapture (nChIC) platform suitable for individualized medicine applications. Droplet microfluidics offer several benefits, including rapid, controlled, and efficient fluid handling, and the capacity to handle variable sample sizes, since devices can accommodate larger samples by simply operating for longer periods of time.

Importantly, these processes will be carried out at the single cell level, which promises to provide unique insights into epigenomic tumor heterogeneity. Beyond single cells, the unprecedented ability to handle samples of variable input will also facilitate robust validation against traditional ChIP assays to demonstrate broad genomic coverage.

5R21CA193064-03,R21CA193064,9070649,2016,Cellular biofactories for therapeutic protein synthesis in tumor microenvironment,"﻿ DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): T cells undergo an intelligent decision-making process based on the inhibitory and excitatory chemotactic inputs; and extravagate to the tumor microenvironment through solid tissue barriers. Investigators' long-term goal, to be pursued in R33 phase, is to develop T cells into a platform vector technology for active drug- transport to the solid tumors. In this R21 application, their objective is to engineer a robust mechanism to transform autologous T cells into biofactories for autonomous synthesis of cytocidal secretory proteins upon stimulation by the tumor cells. Autonomous synthesis of Protein-of-Interest (PoI) with spatiotemporal resolution will enable targeting of tumor burden with cellular resolution and molecular specificity. Their central hypothesis is that T cells can be genetically encoded for robust modulation and biosynthesis of therapeutic proteins at the tumor site. They have chosen ovarian cancer that expresses Folate Receptor alpha (FRa) as disease model, and an apoptotic protein for its cytotoxic therapeutic value. However, the rationale for developing T cells as protein biofactories is that this is a platform technology and their specificity can be modified to target any cancer and autonomously synthesize any PoI in situ. To aid this R21 effort, they have developed cell lines expressing bioluminescent and fluorescent reporters expressed only when stimulated by tumor cells. With following specific aims, they will advance this project towards its goals: (1) To develop robust control on biosynthesis of protein-of-interest (PoI); (2) To develop T cells as biofactories for autonomous secretion of antitumor apoptotic protein. It is expected that this R21 phase will lead to T cells that will not activate in healthy tissues (enhanced safety) and hyperactivate specifically in the tumor microenvironment (enhanced efficacy). The impact of this research will also be felt on ongoing T-cell therapy trials by reducing the incidences of graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD). This pioneering approach builds upon ongoing T-cell immunotherapy trials, which are currently limited to control minimal residual disease (MRD) and is administered after chemotherapy. Proposed research is transformative, firstly because it will expand the scope of T-cell engineering to replace systemic chemotherapies.

5R21CA193064-04,R21CA193064,9281693,2017,Cellular biofactories for therapeutic protein synthesis in tumor microenvironment,"﻿ DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): T cells undergo an intelligent decision-making process based on the inhibitory and excitatory chemotactic inputs; and extravagate to the tumor microenvironment through solid tissue barriers. Investigators' long-term goal, to be pursued in R33 phase, is to develop T cells into a platform vector technology for active drug- transport to the solid tumors. In this R21 application, their objective is to engineer a robust mechanism to transform autologous T cells into biofactories for autonomous synthesis of cytocidal secretory proteins upon stimulation by the tumor cells. Autonomous synthesis of Protein-of-Interest (PoI) with spatiotemporal resolution will enable targeting of tumor burden with cellular resolution and molecular specificity. Their central hypothesis is that T cells can be genetically encoded for robust modulation and biosynthesis of therapeutic proteins at the tumor site. They have chosen ovarian cancer that expresses Folate Receptor alpha (FRa) as disease model, and an apoptotic protein for its cytotoxic therapeutic value. However, the rationale for developing T cells as protein biofactories is that this is a platform technology and their specificity can be modified to target any cancer and autonomously synthesize any PoI in situ. To aid this R21 effort, they have developed cell lines expressing bioluminescent and fluorescent reporters expressed only when stimulated by tumor cells. With following specific aims, they will advance this project towards its goals: (1) To develop robust control on biosynthesis of protein-of-interest (PoI); (2) To develop T cells as biofactories for autonomous secretion of antitumor apoptotic protein. It is expected that this R21 phase will lead to T cells that will not activate in healthy tissues (enhanced safety) and hyperactivate specifically in the tumor microenvironment (enhanced efficacy). The impact of this research will also be felt on ongoing T-cell therapy trials by reducing the incidences of graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD). This pioneering approach builds upon ongoing T-cell immunotherapy trials, which are currently limited to control minimal residual disease (MRD) and is administered after chemotherapy. Proposed research is transformative, firstly because it will expand the scope of T-cell engineering to replace systemic chemotherapies. This will then be used for reduction of tumor burden rather than keeping MRD in check. Secondly, therapeutic proteins of non-human origin are efficiently degraded and removed by the immune system. This is a barrier to their in vivo application. The use of autologous T cells for biosynthesis of therapeutic proteins at the target site will eliminate any immunogenicity issues.

Recent single cell genetic studies have shown that driver mutations and cancer cell subtype are highly heterogeneous within a single patient. Thus, clinicians will need to employ experimental methods that allow observation of a variety of molecular analytes across many individual cells within a particular patient's tumor section in situ. Current tumor section analyses are not highly multiplexed and typically remain limited to ~4-5 analytes, or 7 with multi-spectral imaging. Recent technologies have pushed this number into 30s-60s, but they require expensive equipment and/or reagents, sophisticated analyses or markedly increased assay time, all of which would preclude their practical use in many clinical pathology and preclinical research laboratories. Thus, there remains a significant need for technologies that multiplex measurements in tumor sections but are widely accessible and cost-effective. We focus on addressing this need with a readily-adoptable but novel multi- spectral fluorescence-based method. It is based on the hypothesis that the power of combinatorics can be harnessed to vastly increase the number of quantifiable analytes in a mixture by permuting the wide array of available fluorophores in new ways. We term our approach combinatorial fluorescence with spectral imaging (CoFSI). CoFSI only requires the ability to perform multi-channel fluorescence excitation and emission spectral scanning, which is widely available and easy to implement in most plate/slide readers and many microscopes. Data analysis involves a straightforward, fast computational technique called linear unmixing. Preliminary simulation studies suggest that the concentrations of 123 different CoFSI probes constructed from 16 existing fluorescent proteins can be estimated simultaneously with good accuracy and precision across 3 orders of concentration magnitude with a large number of excitation channels, and 48 probes with 6 excitation channels. Similar simulation studies constrained by available tumor section imaging equipment and Alexa dyes suggest 25 simultaneous measurements are possible. Initial pilot experiments demonstrate that seven different CoFSI probe levels in a mixture can be measured both accurately and precisely using only the blue-yellow part of the spectrum. This proposal further tests the limits of CoFSI experimentally, and applies CoFSI to tumor section imaging, with two Aims: (1) Quantify the Levels of 48 Fluorescent Probes in a Mixture Simultaneously; and (2) Quantify the Spatial Distribution of 25 Analytes in Tumor Sections. If successful, CoFSI can increase quantitative fluorescence multiplexing at least ~5 to 10-fold while relying on standard lab resources and straightforward analyses.

5R21CA202831-02,R21CA202831,9257339,2017,Novel Bi-functional Inhibitors Blocking OncomiR Biogenesis,"﻿ DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this proposal is to develop a new class of selective miRNA regulators that blocks the maturation of oncomiRs. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate diverse biological processes. Dysregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) has become one of the emerging mechanisms contributes to cancer formation and progression. Increasing evidences suggest that certain miRNAs affect cellular transformation, carcinogenesis and metastasis, and act as oncogenes (oncogenic miRNAs or oncomiRs). Understanding the roles of oncomiRs in cancer will lead to the development of new cancer therapies. Besides, direct therapeutic intervention of oncomiRs has become a promising new direction for treating cancer. For both research and therapeutic purposes, methods allowing the control of oncomiR levels are highly desirable. Current methods for such purposes generally suffer from the off-target inhibition. To address this critical issue, we propose a novel strategy to regulate miRNA. We will develop a new class of bi-functional miRNA regulators consisting of independent and specialized ""pre-miRNA recognition unit"" and ""Dicer inhibition unit"" to target unique pre- miRNAs and block their processing to generate mature miRNAs by inhibiting Dicer enzymatic activity. The following Aims will accomplish our goal of establishing this new strategy: Aim 1. Synthesize and test bi- functional miRNA regulators. We will synthesize bi-functional regulators for miRNA-21 (miR-21) and other oncomiRs and test their inhibitory activity. Aim 2: Test the activity and specificity of the bi-functional miRNA regulator in cells. We will optimize cellular uptake of the regulator in mammalian cells. The cellular activity and off-target effects of the regulator will be evaluated in cells. This work will establish the technical foundation of a novel oncomiR regulation strategy. This unique technology will address the major obstacle encountered in current miRNA regulating methods and enhance the capability to dissect the roles of oncomiRs in cancer biology. It will significantly contribute to the advancement in our knowledge of the role played by oncomiRs in cancer and will result in the development of novel cancer therapies either directly based on the bi- modular regulators or evolved from the understanding of oncomiR functions unveiled by this new technology.",Address;Adverse effects;Affect;Affinity;Antisense Oligonucleotides;Binding;Biogenesis;Biological Assay;Biological Process;Cancer Biology;Cell physiology;Cells;Development;Dicer Enzyme;Foundations;Generations;Goals;In Vitro;Knowledge;Link;Malignant Neoplasms;Mammalian Cell;Messenger RNA;Methods;MicroRNAs;Neoplasm Metastasis;Northern Blotting;Oncogenes;Oncogenic;Pathogenesis;Play;Proteins;Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR;RNA;Regulation;Research;Role;Specificity;Technology;Testing;Therapeutic;Therapeutic Intervention;Untranslated RNA;Western Blotting;Work;base;cancer therapy;cancer type;carcinogenesis;design;improved;inhibitor/antagonist;interest;metaplastic cell transformation;new technology;next generation;novel;novel strategies;novel therapeutics;public health relevance;research and development;ribosome profiling;transcriptome sequencing;uptake,Fu-Sen Liang,John R Knowlton,184599,184599,2017-04-26T12:04:00Z,2016-05-01T12:05:00Z,2019-04-30T12:04:00Z,RFA-CA-15-002,nofo_RFA-CA-15-002,university of new mexico,ALBUQUERQUE,NM,UNITED STATES,imat,org_name,False
5R21CA212726-04,R21CA212726,9724420,2019,A molecular toolkit for the production of tyrosine phosphorylated proteins,"Project Summary Tyrosine phosphorylation can regulate protein function, and this is a cornerstone of cell signaling networks. Ty- rosine phosphorylation often becomes dysregulated in cancer and therefore, understanding the effect of phos- phorylation on protein function will be paramount to identifying therapeutic interventions in cancer. Unfortunately, an important tool in the basic research of phosphorylation – testing the effect of protein phosphorylation by com- paring the function of the phosphorylated form with an unphosphorylated form of the protein in in vitro assays – is signiﬁcantly hindered by our limited knowledge in how to make a phosphorylated protein. This project seeks to build a molecular technology, inspired by previous observations of biochemistry in cell networks, to overcome this requirement and improve the pace of basic research. The goal of this research is to build a fast, accessible and inexpensive method for producing phosphorylated and soluble proteins in a bacterial system. The goals will be achieved by: development of a molecular toolkit for the enhancement and control of precise phosphorylation on protein substrates using secondary kinase-substrate targeting approaches, testing the toolkit on a set of sub- strates, and comparing the outcome with current technologies. It is anticipated that this technology will be less expensive, more physiologically-relevant, and capable of producing a larger variety of phosphorylated forms of proteins than current molecular approaches to studying the effect of protein phosphorylation.",Amino Acid Sequence;Automobile Driving;Basic Cancer Research;Basic Science;Binding;Biochemical;Biochemistry;Biological;Biological Assay;Cells;Development;Engineering;Escherichia coli;Glutamic Acid;Goals;Grant;Human;Kinetics;Knowledge;Libraries;Malignant Neoplasms;Mass Spectrum Analysis;Measurement;Measures;Methods;Molecular;Molecular Bank;Mutate;Outcome;Pattern;Phosphoproteins;Phosphorylation;Phosphotransferases;Phosphotyrosine;Physiological;Post-Translational Protein Processing;Process;Production;Property;Proteins;Proteome;Recombinant Proteins;Recombinants;Regulation;Research;Research Personnel;SH3 Domains;Signal Transduction;Specificity;Substrate Domain;Substrate Specificity;System;Technology;Testing;Therapeutic Intervention;Thick;Tyrosine;Tyrosine Phosphorylation;Work;base;improved;in vitro Assay;polyproline;protein function;src Homology Region 2 Domain;technology development;tool;vector,Kristen M Naegle,Anowarul Amin,184556,184556,2019-07-09T12:07:00Z,2017-08-16T12:08:00Z,2021-07-31T12:07:00Z,RFA-CA-16-001,nofo_RFA-CA-16-001,university of virginia,CHARLOTTESVILLE,VA,UNITED STATES,imat,org_name,False

Induction of gene expression on demand is a mainstay of modern biology and cancer research. Nowadays, this is commonly accomplished by one particular approach, induction by tetracycline analogs of gene expression driven by Tn10 TetR derivatives. The TetR derivatives and doctrine for using them date from the early 1990s. These 20+ year-old methods continue to aid research on oncoproteins, tumor suppressors, cell death proteins, cell cycle proteins, and other key proteins and RNAs in cells and animals. But these approaches suffer from serious limitations. First, systems in common use operationally produce all-or-nothing induction, rather than tunable expression. Second, TetR is the only well developed chemically-inducible DNA binding moiety in wide use, and, as a consequence, investigators can typically only conditionally induce one gene product or trigger one event. Finally, these systems do not use closed- loop or feedback control. Induced gene expression is thus subject to significant cell-to-cell variation, much of it due to intracellular differences in gene expression capacity, G. A number of developments now allow us to build systems not subject to these limitations. Consideration of feedback control in bacterial systems, better understanding of artificial repression by prokaryotic repressors in eukaryotes (which we developed in the 1980s), and work in yeast has enabled systems that offer tunable induction buffered against cell-cell variation. Wholesale bacterial DNA sequencing has revealed 1000s of new TetR family repressors to make new proteins. Cas9/ CRISPR approaches now facilitate experimentation to optimize performance, by making it possible to compare expression from different test constructs integrated in single copy at the same mammalian genomic site. In this pilot phase of work, we will concentrate the risks of using lessons from yeast to build better controllers of mammalian gene expression. We will develop and distribute to other researchers at least three (3) new chemically tunable mammalian controllers that respond to different small-molecule ligands.

5R21CA258013-02,R21CA258013,10417132,2022,Device for Preservation of Cell Free RNA in Saliva,"ABSTRACT Early detection is critical to cancer mortality reductions, and yet the breast imaging clinic visits required for these life-saving early detection programs are inaccessible to disadvantaged, remote, or quarantined populations with limited medical facility access. In fact, breast cancer surveillance programs this year have stalled by as much as 90% versus their pre-pandemic rates, resulting in risky delays in new cancer diagnosis [1]. A saliva-based test for early detection could transform today’s screening paradigms. A promising biofluid for disease detection, saliva can be self-sampled non-invasively, without trained technicians. Saliva is ideal for at-home and other non-clinical site collection; it contains a variety of analytes including exosomes, RNA, DNA, proteins, metabolites, viruses and oral microflora, and is a powerful window on health and disease. Recently, saliva samples have shown better clinical utility vs. nasal swabs for detecting COVID-19 [2]. Mounting evidence exists for oral microbiome links to systemic disease [3], and salivary biomarkers diagnose complex traits such as pediatric medical conditions, traumatic brain injury, autism, and cancer [4-7]. A commercial saliva-based test for autism is based on 32 human and microbial RNA markers [8]. In many complex trait studies, saliva is frozen as cell-free supernatant. The most prevalent saliva collection and preservation devices, although easy-to-use, preclude effective cell-free RNA and exosome analysis, since saliva samples are treated with lysis reagents resulting in mixed populations of cellular and non-cellular RNAs, increasing noise and damaging performance characteristics. Saliva collection devices that instead use membranes to separate cells suffer from inefficient recovery of critical analytes, either because they lack appropriate preservatives or because they adsorb and therefore lose, a substantial analyte fraction. To enable widespread use for disease detection, new standardized methods are needed to preserve cell-free saliva and retain the integrity of its key constituents for stable transport and downstream analysis. This project extends our past SBIR grant work and our own internal research, to develop an easy-to-use saliva collection and preservation device to stabilize cfRNA and other analytes, enabling us and others to efficiently collect high-quality clinical saliva samples. Using RT-qPCR assays and RNA isotype profiles, we will characterize salivary cfRNA integrity and stability over timelines sufficient for remote collection and transport. Armed with well-characterized RNA decay profiles, we propose an iterative design-of-experiment approach to prototype a versatile device to collect and preserve saliva at room temperature (RT), stabilizing RNA while also preventing cell lysis and bacterial growth. Our device performance validation will use prospectively collected and preserved saliva from >50 women to demonstrate stability for up 72 hours at ambient conditions.

This technology will be based on a spatially-arrayed aptamer microchip and sensitive fluorescence-based optical detection techniques. The system will provide a powerful new tool for biomedical research and diagnosis of diseases and cancers. Currently, the levels of cellular proteins are inferred from cellular mRNA levels by using DNA oligonucleotide microchips. These microchips allow the detection of mRNA levels by base-pairing interactions to homologous DNA oligomers located at different sites in the microchip array. However, this indirect assay of protein levels suffers from two problems: First, mRNA levels may not accurately reflect the level of encoded protein because translation and degradation rates vary from protein to protein and are regulated in response to cell physiology. Second, post-translational modifications proteins often alter critical protein activities. This technology we propose to develop is comprised of three parts: 1) Aptamers with high-affinity and high-specifity for individual proteins. These aptamers will be designed to have ligand-dependent changes in fluorescence properties. 2) A microchip array with each array site occupied by aptamers against a different target molecule. 3) An evanescent field fluorescence detector which detects target molecules binding to aptamers at the array sites.

Microchannel ""tandem"" SSCP/HA is a novel mutation detection method recently developed in our laboratory, which involves the simultaneous generation and analysis of homo/heteroduplex DNA and SSCP conformers. Studies of a significant number of samples (32) indicate that tandem SSCP/HA allows for much higher-sensitivity mutation detection (100%) than SSCP alone (93%) or HA alone (75%), for p53 samples.

The p53 gene, known to be mutated in >50% of human cancers, and whose mutation status can be predictive of patient response to chemotherapy, is the important model system chosen. However, microchip-based genetic analysis technologies to be developed should be easily applied to ANY cancer-related gene.

5R33CA105514-03,R33CA105514,7108593,2006,Assaying Tyrosine Kinase Activity: A New Paradigm,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): New approaches are needed in the molecular analyses of the growth-promoting signal transduction pathways involved in the development and maintenance of cancer. The Laser Micropipet System (LMS), a new technology for the biochemical assay of kinases, holds the promise of directly assaying the activities of protein tyrosine kinases in primary patient cells. The LMS was developed for the assay of serine/threonine kinases in individual cells grown in tissue culture. This R21/R33 application proposes to expand the applications of this instrumentation to directly determine the activity of oncogenic tyrosine kinases in primary cells from patients. Assay of Bcr-Abl in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) will demonstrate the power of this tool for research, clinical, and pharmacologic applications. While this assay will be of value in the study of the biology and resistance mechanisms in CML, the studies will lay the groundwork for a new paradigm in the study of molecular mechanisms in cancer signal transduction and will have general applicability. The R21 phase of this proposal is designed to establish the feasibility of assaying Bcr-Abl activity and to demonstrate the necessary assay conditions for measurements in cells derived from a patient with CML. The specific aims are to: 1) identify and characterize a reporter of intracellular Bcr-Ab1 kinase activity, 2) define and optimize conditions for measuring Bcr-Ab1 activity in human cells, 3) compare reporter phosphorylation in cells expressing Bcr-Ab1 vs. cells lacking this kinase, and 4) demonstrate the feasibility of using primary patient cells in kinase assays. The goal of the R33 phase is to demonstrate the potential for the LMS-based kinase assay in applications for the study of the biology of pharmacologic resistance in CML, including from primary patient cells. The R33 specific aims are to: 1) develop a membrane-permeant Bcr-Ab1 kinase reporter, 2) demonstrate the ability to detect imatinib resistance in CML cell lines, 3) determine Bcr-Ab1 activity in primary cells from patients with CML and their response to pharmacologic inhibition, and 4) determine if the assay can detect the emergence of imatinib resistance in CML patients and can differentiate the mechanisms of drug resistance.",biological signal transduction;capillary electrophoresis;carcinogenesis;cell growth regulation;chronic myelogenous leukemia;clinical research;enzyme activity;enzyme mechanism;gene expression;human subject;intracellular;neoplastic cell;oncoproteins;phosphorylation;protein purification;protein tyrosine kinase;reporter genes;single cell analysis;technology /technique development,Christopher E Sims,Min-Kyung H Song,379961,379961,2006-08-01T12:08:00Z,2005-08-08T12:08:00Z,2007-06-30T12:06:00Z,PAR-01-106,nofo_PAR-01-106,university of california-irvine,IRVINE,CA,UNITED STATES,imat,org_name,False

Extant proteomics methods are limited to quantifying a few thousands of the most abundant proteins and, therefore, are unsuitable for the targeted profiling of less abundant farnesylated expression. The major goal of this application is to develop and validate a powerful technology, Tagging via Azido Substrate (TAS), for the efficient isolation of farnesylated proteins. This technology will then be applied to the proteomics analysis of farnesylated proteins in physiologically relevant models. The TAS technology involves the introduction of a synthetic azide-modified farnesyl substrate, either farnesyl azide diphosphate (FPP-azide) or farnesyl azide alcohol (F-azide-OH), which replaces the natural substrate during cellular protein farnesylation. The resulting farnesyl-azide (F-azide)-modified proteins will be affinity-purified through an azide-specific conjugation reaction (Staudinger reaction) using a phosphine capture reagent linked to photo-cleavable beads, which can then be released by UV light-induced photo-cleavage. Since affinity purification relies on covalent bonding resulting from a specific conjugation reaction between an azide and phosphine capture reagent, other proteins without the F-azide modification can be effectively removed by thorough washing. Thus, the TAS technology will allow farnesylated proteins to be isolated with high yield, high specificity, and low contamination. The initial focus of the R21 portion of this proposal is on the development of TAS technology and its application to the isolation of farnesylated proteins. These studies will be extended subsequently to geranylgeranylated proteins. The R33 proposal will aim at applications of the TAS technology to the identification of novel FTI targets.

5R33CA114149-03,R33CA114149,7283630,2007,Imaging tumor associated fibroblast activation protein,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this research is to develop a novel fibroblast activation protein (FAP) sensing near infrared fluorescence reporter for early tumor detection and tumor classification. FAP is a cell surface antigen of reactive tumor stromal fibroblasts founded in more than 90% of epithelial carcinomas, but it is absent from epithelial carcinoma cells, normal fibroblasts, and other normal human tissue. Supporting tumor stromal fibroblasts are generally localized close to tumor vasculature, which is essential for early tumor development and growth. Thus it has been chosen as a target for monoclonal antibody based tumor therapy. FAP is not only a membrane protein but also a dipeptidyl peptidase. An imaging probe to report enzymatic activity and location of FAP could be extremely useful for early tumor detection. In this application we will develop a small molecular probe with ultra-sensitivity based on a unique class of fluorogenic chromophore that has significant changes in emission at different chemical states. Specifically, the probes emit no fluorescence in their initial intact state but become brightly fluorescent after specific proteolytic reaction. The newly developed low molecular weight, well defined fluorogenic probes are expected to have several advantages for imaging: a) fast tissue distribution allowing earlier imaging after injection, b) fast clearance allowing repeated imaging, and c) high likelihood of developing key candidates into clinically useful agents. The choice of FAP is based on its importance in tumor growth, invasion, and other processes in oncogenesis. Together with recent developments in fluorescence imaging technologies, this research is expected to ultimately result in clinical imaging agents with specificity for targeted enzymes. We believe that the developed approach can be used as a platform to design a broad spectrum of activatable molecular probes to image other amino peptidases in vivo.",Carcinoma;Chemicals;Class;Classification;Clinical;Detection;Development;Dipeptidyl Peptidases;Drug or chemical Tissue Distribution;Enzymes;Fibroblasts;Fluorescence;Goals;Growth and Development function;Image;Imaging technology;Injection of therapeutic agent;Localized;Location;Malignant Epithelial Cell;Membrane Proteins;Molecular Probes;Molecular Weight;Monoclonal Antibodies;Peptide Hydrolases;Process;Reaction;Reporter;Reporting;Research;Specificity;Stromal Neoplasm;Surface Antigens;base;chromophore;design;fibroblast-activating factor;fluorescence imaging;human tissue;imaging probe;in vivo;novel;tumor;tumor growth;tumorigenesis,Ching-Hsuan Tung,James W.

5R33CA118602-02,R33CA118602,7213354,2007,Technology/Map Endothelial Targets/Human Renal Tumors,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The molecular complexity and in vivo inaccessibility of most tumor cells within solid tumors can greatly limit genomic- and proteomic-based discovery of useful targets for tumor-specific imaging and therapeutic agents in vivo. To overcome endothelial cell (EC) barriers and achieve more effective targeting and penetration into solid tumors, we shift analytical focus from the tumor cell to the vascular EC surface and its caveolae in direct contact with the circulating blood. To reduce data complexity to a meaningful subset of targetable proteins expressed on the EC surface, we will use tissue sub-cellular fractionation, novel multimodal mass spectrometric analysis, in silico subtraction, and bioinformatics interrogation of structure and function to unmask, from the >100,000 proteins in the tissue, those few intravenously accessible proteins differentially expressed on vascular endothelium in human renal tumors. This technology and overall approach has been validated in rodent solid tumors whereby new vascular targets have been uncovered permitting tumor-specific imaging, penetration, and effective radio immunotherapy (Nature, 429:629-35, 2004). But, currently very little is known about the expression of proteins in tumor neovascular endothelium, especially in human tissue. We now wish to apply our new technology to map comprehensively the proteome of luminal EC surfaces and caveolae in human renal tumors in vivo. It is likely that human tumors will express a different constellation of proteins on tumor neovasculature not yet uncovered or induced in animal models. To this end, we propose the following specific aims: 1) To use novel tissue sub fractionation and proteomic analytical approaches to map comprehensively vascular EC surfaces and caveolae in human renal tumors vs. matched normal renal tissue to unmask candidate tumor-induced/associated vascular proteins. 2) To create new antibodies to newly discovered human renal tumor EC targets and to use antibodies as probes to validate the expression of tumor-induced/associated proteins at the EC surface and its caveolae in human tissues and thereby to assess the degree of target specificity for the neovasculature of human solid tumors.

In addition, refinement of conjugation methods of nanoporous particles will allow selective targeting of endothelial cells in vitro and tumor-associated blood vessels in vivo and in combination with refinement of loading strategies, cytotoxic agents loaded into nanoparticles can selectively destroy these vessels. Our experimental plan is based on our expertise in development and refinement of emerging nanotechnology approaches for protein capture, for selective targeting and loading of silicon nanoparticles. These studies also take advantage of our experience in identification of novel proteins within the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family of proteins that are essential in the process of tumor-associated angiogenesis. To achieve the goal of developing and refining tools for detection of angiogenic proteins and for selective targeting and destruction of tumor-associated blood vessels, the following Specific Aims are proposed: 1. Develop and refine silica chips with nanocharacteristics to enhance the sensitivity of LC-MS/MS identification VEGF proteins in serum and in skin tumors during skin tumor-associated angiogenesis in vivo; 2. Refine conjugation of silicon nanoparticles to anti-VEGFR-2 receptor antibodies for selective targeting of endothelial cells in vitro and targeting tumor-associated blood vessels in vivo; 3. Determine the ability of silicon nanoparticles conjugated with anti-VEGFR-2 antibodies to be loaded with and to deliver the cytotoxic agent melatin for destruction of endothelial cells in vitro and for destruction of tumor-associated blood vessels in vivo. These studies will provide sensitive nanotechnology tools that are critical in defining the proteome in serum and tumors related to tumor angiogenesis that is currently unexplored. These studies may also provide strategies to selectively target tumor vessels for destruction using nanotechnology approaches.",Angiogenic Proteins;Antibodies;Award;Blood Vessels;Characteristics;Clinical Trials;Cytotoxic agent;Detection;Development;Diagnosis;Endothelial Cells;Fc Receptor;Goals;Harvest;Image;In Vitro;Mass Spectrum Analysis;Metabolic;Methods;Modeling;Molecular Weight;Mus;Nanotechnology;Nutrient;Oxygen;Patients;Phase;Process;Protein Family;Proteins;Proteome;Publications;Research;Research Personnel;Series;Serum;Silicon;Silicon Dioxide;Skin;Skin Neoplasms;Source;Surface;Time;Tumor Angiogenesis;Tumor Tissue;Tumor-Associated Process;Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2;Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors;analytical method;angiogenesis;base;experience;in vivo;liquid chromatography mass spectrometry;nanoparticle;novel;outcome forecast;particle;programs;tool;tumor;tumor growth;tumorigenesis,Mauro Ferrari,James Tricoli,373125,373125,2009-08-20T12:08:00Z,2008-08-01T12:08:00Z,2011-07-31T12:07:00Z,RFA-CA-06-003,nofo_RFA-CA-06-003,university of texas hlth sci ctr houston,HOUSTON,TX,UNITED STATES,imat,org_name,False

5R33CA173373-02,R33CA173373,8738620,2014,Clinical validation of the HD-CTC fluid biopsy in early detection of lung cancer.,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Currently, the clinical diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) relies on a number of imaging modalities followed by a tissue confirmation with an invasive procedure. This process is somewhat imprecise because a patient's pathologic diagnosis after surgery may be discordant from pre-operative assessment and may contribute to poor patient prognosis since accurately staging early cancers is essential to good outcome. We hypothesize that rigorously validating the recently developed High Definition Circulating Tumor Cell (HD- CTC) Fluid Biopsy in a controlled clinical cohort of patients undergoing evaluation for lung cancer will improve the accuracy of detection and prognosis in early-stage, malignant nodules of the lung with non-small cell lung cancer histology. We will capitalize on NIH-supported proof of concept data, which has demonstrated that the HD-CTC Fluid Biopsy is capable of detecting disease derived cells in the majority of patients at the time of diagnosis. These data now motivate us to investigate the performance of the assay ""the day before diagnosis"" with the expectation of achieving similar results in a more realistic, prospectively designed, clinical study with matched controls consisting of patients who have non-malignant lung nodules. Our aim is to accurately establish the test characteristics of the HD-CTC fluid biopsy in a group of patients undergoing evaluation for lung cancer and to identify those patients with malignant nodules that have detectable HD-CTCs to determine whether the fluid biopsy can augment 1) clinical staging prior to definitive treatment and 2) prognosis after definitive diagnosis and treatment. We will significantly enhance the test by developing single cell molecular analysis to provide definitive characterization. Integrating non-invasive, reliable and accurate circulating biomarkers with the current standard of care will not only allow for the development of more accurate clinical prediction models that are cost-effective, but may also augment our understanding of tumor biology and metastasis using a clinical, in vivo model of early non-small cell lung cancer.",Advanced Development;Biological Assay;Biological Markers;Biology;Biopsy;Blood Tests;Cancer Histology;Caring;Cells;Characteristics;Clinic;Clinical;Clinical Data;Clinical Research;Data;Detection;Development;Diagnosis;Diagnostic;Disease;Emerging Technologies;Enrollment;Epithelial Cells;Evaluation;Fluorescent in Situ Hybridization;Genome;Genomics;Image;Investigation;Liquid substance;Lung nodule;Malignant - descriptor;Malignant Neoplasms;Malignant neoplasm of lung;Malignant neoplasm of pancreas;Malignant neoplasm of prostate;Measures;Medical;Methods;Modeling;Molecular;Molecular Analysis;Morphology;Neoplasm Circulating Cells;Neoplasm Metastasis;Nodule;Non-Malignant;Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma;Operative Surgical Procedures;Outcome;Pathologic;Patients;Performance;Phase;Positron-Emission Tomography;Procedures;Process;Prospective Studies;Proteins;Publishing;Recurrence;Relative (related person);Research Design;Sampling;Specificity;Staging;Staging System;System;Techniques;Technology;Testing;Time;Tissues;Translations;Tumor Biology;United States National Institutes of Health;Validation;Venous blood sampling;anticancer research;case control;clinical Diagnosis;clinically relevant;cohort;cost effective;design;disease characteristic;disorder subtype;expectation;imaging modality;immunocytochemistry;improved;in vivo;in vivo Model;insight;lung cancer screening;malignant breast neoplasm;outcome forecast;performance tests;prognostic;public health relevance;response;standard of care;tool;translational study;tumor;tumor metabolism;tumor progression,Peter Kuhn,Matthew R Young,521105,521105,2014-08-26T12:08:00Z,2013-09-20T12:09:00Z,2014-12-31T12:12:00Z,RFA-CA-13-002,nofo_RFA-CA-13-002,"scripps research institute, the",LA JOLLA,CA,UNITED STATES,imat,org_name,False

For example, Otto Warburg and others discovered that tumors have increased glucose uptake, glycolysis, and lactate production, often with a reduction in citric acid cycle. While “aerobic glycolysis” at first glance is energetically expensive for tumor cells because it circumvents high ATP production from the citric acid cycle, it allows cancer cells to survive under low nutrient or low oxygen conditions and to instead use glycolytic intermediates for the synthesis of essential cellular building blocks without further energy investment.

5R33CA235326-02,R33CA235326,9896793,2020,A Single Conical Tube Device for Precision CAR-T Cells Manufacturing,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Chimeric-antigen-receptor T cells (CAR T cells) have achieved extraordinary success in treating B cell malignancies and have demonstrated high potential for treating solid tumors. However, their widespread use is limited by a number of difficulties in manufacturing such cells. Current manufacturing processes are complicated, costly, and can only produce cells for small populations. Additionally, they have large production variations. As a result, different patients receive very different products or treatments. The long-term goal is to develop a novel technology to address the CAR T manufacturing challenge. Toward this goal, the team has developed a proof- of-concept technology termed stress-free intra-tubular cell culture technology (SFIT). SFIT provides cells uniform, highly reproducible, controllable, and cell-friendly microenvironments, resulting in extremely high culture efficiency and consistency. SFIT produces cells for each patient with one small conical tube, significantly reducing production cost and increasing production capability. The purpose of this project is to further develop and validate this technology and the associated methods to make it ready for the final translational challenge. Leveraging sound preliminary studies and a diverse team of experts, the specific aims are to (1) validate SFIT for culturing T cells from a wide range of donors and for culturing various T cell subtypes, (2) further develop and validate methods for transducing T cells with lentivirus and γ-retrovirus in SFIT, and (3) further develop and validate the SFIT-based single-conical-tube-device for producing autologous CAR T cells. The project will build on the team’s strong preliminary work and include mathematical modeling, prototype device design, extensive T cell culturing, exome-Seq and RNA-Seq data analyses, in vivo testing, statistical analyses and comparisons, and partnership with ADS BIOTEC, a company that designs, builds, and sells instruments for processing human cells. With the completion of this project, simple, disposable, affordable devices for the scalable, cost-effective and consistent production of autologous CAR T cells are expected. This technology can also be scaled up for producing allogeneic CAR T cells in large scales if needed. This technology will not only make CAR T cells broadly accessible, but also make the product much more consistent and predictable. Based on 2012-2014 data, approximately 38.5% of the human population will be diagnosed with some type of cancer during their lifetime.

5R33CA256102-03,R33CA256102,10693406,2023,Multimodality X-ray transmission and diffraction scanner for molecular analysis of cancer specimens,"ABSTRACT Cancer research using biospecimens requires the analysis of samples with a large range of sizes (sub-mm to cm) and molecular composition over a wide range of length scales. In many cases, 3-dimensional spatial information about the specimen is critical to understanding and addressing the progression of the disease. X-ray imaging has been widely recognized to play a key role in tissue analysis and cancer assessment. While transmission X-ray imaging (radiography or CT) has been used successfully in some applications wherein sample morphology is highly correlated with the disease state, it lacks molecular specificity, which limits its general utility in specimen analysis. Many groups have demonstrated the utility of X-ray diffraction (XRD) in analyzing molecular structure in biospecimens; however, none have successfully implemented a viable method of fast and accurate 3D XRD measurement in a laboratory environment. The key challenges associated with realizing such a system include the fact that high accuracy XRD measurements have typically required access to a synchrotron or another specialized source, which is difficult for the average researcher to access. In contrast, conventional laboratory diffraction methods are slow, require destruction or alteration of the specimens, and exhibit poor or no volumetric spatial information. To overcome these challenges, we propose to develop a new radiographic imaging device that can scan the entire volume of a biospecimen and generate co-registered, multi-modal X-ray transmission and XRD images. Such technology would allow researchers to study molecular properties of tissue specimens with high spatial resolution and high specificity using a tool that is compact, robust, and easily accessible in an average research laboratory. The samples would be analyzed without contrast agents and with little to no sample preparation required. Through previous work, we have built, tested, and demonstrated the underlying technology required for combined transmission and diffraction imaging of biospecimens. We will now build a clinically accessible, high-resolution prototype of the scanner, test and validate its performance, and demonstrate its utility in imaging bone and breast cancer biospecimens. This project will provide a first-of-its-kind X-ray transmission/diffraction scanner for non-destructive analysis of cancer biospecimens, which could enable pathways for new clinical studies exploring the role of XRD in tissue abnormalities, eventually leading to a better understanding of the genesis and evolution of cancer.",3-Dimensional;Address;Anatomy;Architecture;Biological;Biological Markers;Breast;Clinical;Clinical Research;Code;Contrast Media;Crystallography;Dehydration;Disease;Disease Progression;Ensure;Environment;Evolution;Exhibits;Hour;Image;Imaging Device;Laboratories;Laboratory Research;Legal patent;Length;Malignant Bone Neoplasm;Malignant Neoplasms;Maps;Measurement;Measures;Methods;Molecular;Molecular Analysis;Molecular Structure;Morphology;Multimodal Imaging;PET/CT scan;Pathology;Pathway interactions;Performance;Play;Preparation;Property;Protocols documentation;Research Personnel;Resolution;Roentgen Rays;Role;Rotation;Sampling;Scanning;Source;Specificity;Specimen;Stains;Structure;Surface;Synchrotrons;System;Techniques;Technology;Testing;Thick;Three-Dimensional Imaging;Tissues;Work;X ray diffraction analysis;X-Ray Medical Imaging;anticancer research;bone;bone imaging;cancer biomarkers;cell type;design;high resolution imaging;imaging biomarker;imaging modality;imaging software;innovation;insight;malignant breast neoplasm;meter;microCT;millimeter;multimodality;performance tests;prototype;radiological imaging;reconstruction;single photon emission computed tomography;soft tissue;tissue preparation;tomography;tool;transmission process;tumor;user-friendly,Joel Greenberg,Miguel Ossandon,262875,262875,2023-04-20T12:04:00Z,2021-05-01T12:05:00Z,2025-04-30T12:04:00Z,RFA-CA-20-018,nofo_RFA-CA-20-018,"quadridox, inc.",DURHAM,NC,UNITED STATES,imat,org_name,False
5R44CA097482-04,R44CA097482,7060916,2006,Ultra Rapid Methods for Streamlined Tissue-to-RT-PCR,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Phase II proposal aims to simplify, expedite, and stabilize the recovery of high quality RNA from tissue samples. In Phase I, we demonstrated the feasibility of a hands-off, closed tube tissue disruption method termed ""MELT"" (Multi-Enzymatic Liquefaction of Tissue). MELT enlists potent catabolic enzymes to liquefy tissue within minutes without invasive mechanical force. High yields of intact RNA are obtained after MELT. Importantly, MELT enzymes destroy cellular RNases and stabilize RNA in tissue lysates for up to 5 days at ambient temperatures. Additionally, MELT is compatible with freshly harvested, flash-frozen, or RNAIater(R)-treated tissues, both mouse and human, and including tumor specimens. Taken together, these advances promise faster, simpler, safer, and more robust methods for stabilizing and quantifying gene expression in tissues through innovations in RNA stability, closed-tube tissue disruption, and rapid single-tube sample preparation. In Phase II we will integrate continuing MELT enhancements with new ways to facilitate RNA processing. First, we will accelerate MELT tissue digestions and maximize the quality of the resulting RNA. Second, we will link MELT improvements with novel magnetic beads that can enable the purification of DNA-free RNA in as little as 20 min. This method will secure the recovery of large amounts of RNA for analysis by any expression profiling method, including microarrays. Last, we will enable an ultra rapid RNA sample preparation strategy specifically suited for qRT-PCR (""Tissue-to-RT-PCR"") that skips RNA isolation altogether. Using novel approaches for tissue disruption, RNase control, DNA removal, and the management of RT-PCR inhibition, we will enable Tissue-to-RT-PCR in less than 10 minutes, with all of the steps but the RT-PCR reaction itself occurring in the same tube. Success in these objectives will result in easy-to-use products that offer improved RNA yields, greater sample throughput, more ready automation, and reduced variability, contamination, and biohazard risk compared to current methods. The beneficiaries of MELT technology will include life science researches and clinical diagnostic labs, where emerging RNA biomarkers can be combined with simpler sample preparation methods to hasten the adoption of molecular diagnostics procedures.",RNA;biotechnology;clinical research;endopeptidases;enzymes;gene expression;human tissue;immunomagnetic separation;laboratory mouse;microarray technology;nucleic acid purification;polymerase chain reaction;technology /technique development;temperature;tissue /cell preparation;tissue /organ preservation,Gary J Latham,Avraham Rasooly,468218,468218,2006-07-11T12:07:00Z,2002-09-27T12:09:00Z,2008-04-30T12:04:00Z,RFA-CA-05-008,nofo_RFA-CA-05-008,"ambion diagnostics, inc.",AUSTIN,TX,UNITED STATES,imat,org_name,False

The procedures will be based on the miRNA microarray and fixed tissue RNA isolation systems that we developed in other SBIR-funded programs. The development of our miRNA isolation and labeling procedures will be accomplished using a model system wherein mouse organs will be split and half is flash-frozen and the other half formalin-fixed using a procedure that is commonly employed in hospitals. The frozen and fixed samples will be processed to recover the miRNAs. The miRNAs from the fixed and frozen tissues will be independently labeled and analyzed using miRNA microarrays. The isolation, labeling, and hybridization procedures will be varied until the fixed samples yield the same miRNA expression profiles as the equivalent frozen samples. The fixed sample procedures will) then be used to analyze formalin fixed, human tissue samples to analyze miRNA profiles from multiple organs. The fixed tissue miRNA profiles will be compared to the profiles generated from frozen samples to verify that the fixed tissue miRNA profiling process can be used for stored, human fixed tissue samples. During Phase II of our research project, we will use the miRNA isolation, labeling and microarray analysis procedures developed during Phase I to analyze archived, fixed human cancer tissues to identify miRNAs with expression profiles that are significantly different from equivalent, normal tissues.

6R21CA223901-04,R21CA223901,10602901,2020,Precision controllers of mammalian gene expression,"Project Summary/ Abstract We will build systems that allow greatly improved chemically-tuned control of gene expression in mammalian cells, and make them available to other researchers. Induction of gene expression on demand is a mainstay of modern biology and cancer research. Nowadays, this is commonly accomplished by one particular approach, induction by tetracycline analogs of gene expression driven by Tn10 TetR derivatives. The TetR derivatives and doctrine for using them date from the early 1990s. These 20+ year-old methods continue to aid research on oncoproteins, tumor suppressors, cell death proteins, cell cycle proteins, and other key proteins and RNAs in cells and animals. But these approaches suffer from serious limitations. First, systems in common use operationally produce all-or-nothing induction, rather than tunable expression. Second, TetR is the only well developed chemically-inducible DNA binding moiety in wide use, and, as a consequence, investigators can typically only conditionally induce one gene product or trigger one event. Finally, these systems do not use closed- loop or feedback control. Induced gene expression is thus subject to significant cell-to-cell variation, much of it due to intracellular differences in gene expression capacity, G. A number of developments now allow us to build systems not subject to these limitations. Consideration of feedback control in bacterial systems, better understanding of artificial repression by prokaryotic repressors in eukaryotes (which we developed in the 1980s), and work in yeast has enabled systems that offer tunable induction buffered against cell-cell variation. Wholesale bacterial DNA sequencing has revealed 1000s of new TetR family repressors to make new proteins. Cas9/ CRISPR approaches now facilitate experimentation to optimize performance, by making it possible to compare expression from different test constructs integrated in single copy at the same mammalian genomic site. In this pilot phase of work, we will concentrate the risks of using lessons from yeast to build better controllers of mammalian gene expression. We will develop and distribute to other researchers at least three (3) new chemically tunable mammalian controllers that respond to different small-molecule ligands. We expect that these controllers will become broadly used in cancer research, enabling (among many examples) a) finer control of timing and amount of oncoproteins and other key proteins in cells and animals b) tighter definition of threshold levels of proteins that cause biological effects c) optimization of timing and level of expression of multiple transcription factors to best generate specific differentiated cell types d) construction of cell lines with controlled oncoprotein expression to be used in screens for anticancer drugs.",,Roger Brent,Jerry Li,2263,2263,2022-05-27T12:05:00Z,2018-02-01T12:02:00Z,2023-07-31T12:07:00Z,RFA-CA-17-010,nofo_RFA-CA-17-010,fred hutchinson cancer center,SEATTLE,WA,UNITED STATES,imat,org_name,False
6R21CA258013-03,R21CA258013,10888835,2022,Device for Preservation of Cell Free RNA in Saliva,"ABSTRACT Early detection is critical to cancer mortality reductions, and yet the breast imaging clinic visits required for these life-saving early detection programs are inaccessible to disadvantaged, remote, or quarantined populations with limited medical facility access. In fact, breast cancer surveillance programs this year have stalled by as much as 90% versus their pre-pandemic rates, resulting in risky delays in new cancer diagnosis [1]. A saliva-based test for early detection could transform today’s screening paradigms. A promising biofluid for disease detection, saliva can be self-sampled non-invasively, without trained technicians. Saliva is ideal for at-home and other non-clinical site collection; it contains a variety of analytes including exosomes, RNA, DNA, proteins, metabolites, viruses and oral microflora, and is a powerful window on health and disease. Recently, saliva samples have shown better clinical utility vs. nasal swabs for detecting COVID-19 [2]. Mounting evidence exists for oral microbiome links to systemic disease [3], and salivary biomarkers diagnose complex traits such as pediatric medical conditions, traumatic brain injury, autism, and cancer [4-7]. A commercial saliva-based test for autism is based on 32 human and microbial RNA markers [8]. In many complex trait studies, saliva is frozen as cell-free supernatant. The most prevalent saliva collection and preservation devices, although easy-to-use, preclude effective cell-free RNA and exosome analysis, since saliva samples are treated with lysis reagents resulting in mixed populations of cellular and non-cellular RNAs, increasing noise and damaging performance characteristics. Saliva collection devices that instead use membranes to separate cells suffer from inefficient recovery of critical analytes, either because they lack appropriate preservatives or because they adsorb and therefore lose, a substantial analyte fraction. To enable widespread use for disease detection, new standardized methods are needed to preserve cell-free saliva and retain the integrity of its key constituents for stable transport and downstream analysis. This project extends our past SBIR grant work and our own internal research, to develop an easy-to-use saliva collection and preservation device to stabilize cfRNA and other analytes, enabling us and others to efficiently collect high-quality clinical saliva samples. Using RT-qPCR assays and RNA isotype profiles, we will characterize salivary cfRNA integrity and stability over timelines sufficient for remote collection and transport. Armed with well-characterized RNA decay profiles, we propose an iterative design-of-experiment approach to prototype a versatile device to collect and preserve saliva at room temperature (RT), stabilizing RNA while also preventing cell lysis and bacterial growth. Our device performance validation will use prospectively collected and preserved saliva from >50 women to demonstrate stability for up 72 hours at ambient conditions. This device will standardize methods for collection, stability, and transport of saliva, key to driving virtualized sample collection and healthcare in cancer, viral, and other diagnostics, increasingly critical to a post-pandemic world.",,Shivani Nautiyal,Guillermo Marquez,218184,218184,2024-08-01T12:08:00Z,2021-06-03T12:06:00Z,2025-05-31T12:05:00Z,RFA-CA-20-019,nofo_RFA-CA-20-019,"nowdiagnostics, inc.",SPRINGDALE,AR,UNITED STATES,imat,org_name,False

6R44CA133987-05,R44CA133987,8637449,2013,Single Molecule Fiber Arrays for the Detection of Low Abundance Proteins,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The aim of this project is to develop a new technology that can be used to detect very low concentrations (femtomolar and below) of proteins that are diagnostic for cancer. Presently, early diagnosis of cancer is limited by the fact that the limits of detections (LOD) of available technologies, such as ELISA, are higher than the circulating concentrations of low abundance proteins that could indicate the onset of disease. This program would broaden and strengthen the use a novel fiber optic array single molecule detection technology for extremely high sensitivity measurement of cancer markers. This technology is digital in nature, i.e., individual molecules are quantified by their presence (""on"" signal) or their absence (""off"" signal). By focusing detection at the single molecule level, dramatic improvements in sensitivity are achieved for proteins. Phase I of this project demonstrated that single molecule detection makes it possible to detect concentrations of proteins at levels a thousand times lower than ELISA. Using single molecule detection, prostate specific antigen (PSA) was detected in serum at concentrations less than 1 femtomolar; current immunoanalyzers have an LOD of about 3 picomolar for PSA. The Phase II project has three specific aims that would build on these proof-of-principal experiments to broaden and strengthen the use of the technique for detection of cancer protein markers, and to move the technology closer to commercialization for use by medical researchers and clinicians. First, the ultra-sensitive PSA assay will be used to detect the marker in human clinical samples, specifically to measure the levels of PSA in prostate cancer patients who have undergone radical prostatectomy. Current technologies cannot detect PSA in these samples; this technology could enable the early detection of the return of PSA in serum, which would indicate residual disease. Second, the technology will be expanded to cover more classes of proteins, such as fusion proteins and post-translational modifications, to enable its broader implementation. Third, methods will be developed to measure panels of proteins at low concentrations using small sample volumes. These panels would enable the diagnosis of difficulty to detect diseases, such as ovarian cancer, with greater sensitivity and specificity. The long term objective of this research is to establish a new standard in high sensitivity detection of biological molecules (proteins, peptides, RNA, cells) using instrumentation that would be widely employed in both academic and clinical laboratories. Such an innovation would enable researchers to detect cancer markers at unprecedented levels for early diagnostic applications, and would facilitate the discovery of new low abundance cancer markers. This long term goal satisfies several aspects of the mission of the NIH, in particular, to develop innovative research strategies towards improving the diagnosis, prevention and cure of human diseases. The early diagnosis of cancer is determined by the ability of the clinical oncologist to detect the disease. Quanterix is proposing to develop a technology that would enable clinicians to detect very low concentrations of proteins in blood and, therefore, enable the early diagnosis of disease. This technology has the potential to help medical researchers and doctors to identify and detect many more early cancer diagnostic markers and improve outcomes for patients.",Area;Biological;Biological Assay;Biological Markers;Biological Models;Blood;Cancer Detection;Cancer Diagnostics;Cancer Patient;Cells;Chimeric Proteins;Clinical;Complex;Computer software;Detection;Diagnosis;Diagnostic;Disease;Early Diagnosis;Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay;Fiber;Fiber Optics;Goals;Human;Immunoassay;Individual;Laboratories;Malignant Neoplasms;Malignant neoplasm of ovary;Malignant neoplasm of prostate;Measurement;Measures;Medical;Methods;Mission;Molecular;Nature;Oncologist;Onset of illness;Operative Surgical Procedures;Outcome;Patients;Peptides;Phase;Post-Translational Protein Processing;Prevention;Prostate specific antigen measurement;Prostate-Specific Antigen;Proteins;RNA;Radical Prostatectomy;Reading;Reagent;Reproducibility;Research;Research Personnel;Residual Tumors;Sampling;Sensitivity and Specificity;Serum;Signal Transduction;Techniques;Technology;Time;TimeLine;Translating;United States National Institutes of Health;base;cancer diagnosis;commercialization;digital;human disease;improved;innovation;instrument;instrumentation;meetings;new technology;next generation;novel;programs;protein complex;protein profiling;prototype;research study;single molecule;small molecule,David C Duffy,Patricia A Weber,713497,713497,2013-05-22T12:05:00Z,2008-08-01T12:08:00Z,2014-04-30T12:04:00Z,RFA-CA-08-011,nofo_RFA-CA-08-011,quanterix corporation,Billerica,MA,UNITED STATES,imat,org_name,False
7R21CA083232-02,R21CA083232,6589708,2000,APTAMER BASED DETECTOR TO QUANTIFY MACROMOLECULES,"DESCRIPTION: (Applicant's Description) We propose to develop a technology to simultaneously detect and quantify large numbers individual proteins and post-translationally modified proteins. This technology will be based on a spatially-arrayed aptamer microchip and sensitive fluorescence-based optical detection techniques. The system will provide a powerful new tool for biomedical research and diagnosis of diseases and cancers. Currently, the levels of cellular proteins are inferred from cellular mRNA levels by using DNA oligonucleotide microchips. These microchips allow the detection of mRNA levels by base-pairing interactions to homologous DNA oligomers located at different sites in the microchip array. However, this indirect assay of protein levels suffers from two problems: First, mRNA levels may not accurately reflect the level of encoded protein because translation and degradation rates vary from protein to protein and are regulated in response to cell physiology. Second, post-translational modifications proteins often alter critical protein activities. This technology we propose to develop is comprised of three parts: 1) Aptamers with high-affinity and high-specifity for individual proteins. These aptamers will be designed to have ligand-dependent changes in fluorescence properties. 2) A microchip array with each array site occupied by aptamers against a different target molecule. 3) An evanescent field fluorescence detector which detects target molecules binding to aptamers at the array sites. Our proposal includes plans for: 1) selection of aptamers that can discriminate between different post-translational modifications of the same protein; 2) development of fluorescence-based techniques for detecting oligonucleotide:protein interactions; 3) design and construction of an optimized fluorescence detector; 4) scaling up methods to allow large numbers of independent aptamer selections against different proteins; 5) construction of a prototype protein chip.",macromolecule; messenger RNA; microprocessor /microchip; oligonucleotides; posttranslational modifications; proteins; technology /technique development,Martin J Stanton,,150995,150995,2002-09-09T12:09:00Z,2000-06-01T12:06:00Z,2003-05-31T12:05:00Z,PAR-99-100,nofo_PAR-99-100,archemix corporation,CAMBRIDGE,MA,UNITED STATES,imat,org_name,False
7R21CA112149-02,R21CA112149,7472827,2005,Automated Cell Preparation in Tubes for 3D Microscopy,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): 3D microscopy represents a powerful new cell analysis tool for early detection and diagnosis of cancer, but its future use may be limited because methods for preparation of samples are cumbersome, inefficient, labor intensive and generally imprecise. Current methods for cytological sample collection are manual and distributed in nature through various physicians' office laboratories and local hospitals, with the actual analysis being centralized at regional clinical laboratories. Among the cytological specimens are sputum, gynecological and colorectal scrapes, fine needle aspirates, urinary tract, and gastrointestinal samples. We propose the development of a new automated system that will transform these difficult and messy clinical specimens into an optimal format for 3D microscopy morphological and molecular analysis. The model and method we propose is comprised of three sequential steps. First, at the distributed site, an automated sample processor dissociates and fixes cells and debris for shipment in an automation compatible canister. Second, after shipment to a centralized clinical laboratory, the specimen canisters are loaded into an automatic processor that performs cleanup (debris removal), specimen/assay specific staining (and counterstaining), and finally embedding of cells of interest in glass microcapillary tubes (about 50 mu m ID), with cells being spaced at regular intervals (about 200 mu m) within a tube. This preparation format is uniquely suited for integration with multiple 3D imaging platforms for true 3D volumetric assessment of cell morphology and molecular probe and/or stain density distribution. The proposed system also enables use of cytometric flow sorting for enrichment of cells of interest at an intermediate stage of the sample preparation process. The potential impact to improved human health through rapid diagnostic screening will be illustrated using a high impact emerging technology, optical tomography. In summary, the aim of the proposed project is to develop, design, and build a complete sample processing system that automates the process of sample cleanup, assay specific staining, and mounting of cells into glass microcapillary tubes, and a tube positioning and rotation scanner mechanism for 3D microscopy analysis of cell morphology for the early detection of cancer.",bioimaging /biomedical imaging;biomedical automation;cell morphology;clinical research;cytodiagnosis;early diagnosis;flow cytometry;high throughput technology;human tissue;molecular probes;neoplasm /cancer diagnosis;technology /technique development;three dimensional imaging /topography;tissue /cell preparation,Deirdre R.

7R21CA114135-03,R21CA114135,7340261,2006,Nanoscale Electrocatalytic Protein Detection,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal focuses on a novel system for the electrochemical detection of cancer related protein targets using a nanoscale electrode platform. The assay proposed relies on an electro catalytic process involving two transition-metal ions that reports on biomolecular complexation events. Because the reporter system responds to changes in the electrostatics of an electrode surface, it will enable the analysis of nucleic acids/protein and peptide/protein complexes. The proposed project has 3 specific aims: 1) electro catalytic detection of DNA repair proteins implicated in cancer using DNA-modified electrodes; 2) optimization of electro catalytic detection and multiplexed analysis of cellular DNA repair activities, and 3) development of a generalized electro catalytic protein detection method using prostate cancer biomarkers. The electro catalytic protein detection system described is advantageous because it will allow the analysis and discrimination of multiprotein complexes in addition to uncomplexed analytes and will have high selectivity and specificity. Additionally, the protein detection assays will be conducted using nanoelectrodes that will allow multiplexed detection of panels of different biomolecular targets.",DNA binding protein;DNA repair;biomarker;biotechnology;carbonates;electrochemistry;electrodes;high throughput technology;nanotechnology;oligonucleotides;prostate neoplasms;prostate specific antigen;protein quantitation /detection;synthetic nucleotide;technology /technique development,Shana O Kelley,John R Knowlton,105462,105462,2007-05-02T12:05:00Z,2005-06-21T12:06:00Z,2008-05-31T12:05:00Z,RFA-CA-05-002,nofo_RFA-CA-05-002,university of toronto,TORONTO,ON,CANADA,imat,org_name,False
7R21CA114852-03,R21CA114852,7365035,2006,Profile serum proteins by glycopeptide capture and LC-MS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancers develop over a period of several years and they are characterized by molecular changes prior to invasion and metastasis. Development of a technology that enables screening of cancer from body fluids could permit cancer detection at early and treatable stages. It is expected that the composition of the serum proteome contains valuable information about the state of the human body in health and disease, and that this information can be extracted via quantitative proteomic measurements. Suitable proteomic techniques need to be sensitive, reproducible and robust, to detect potential biomarkers below the level of highly expressed proteins, to generate data sets that are comparable between experiments and laboratories, and have high throughput to support studies with sufficient statistical power. In this proposal, we will develop a method for high throughput quantitative analysis of serum proteins. It consists of the selective isolation of the peptides that are N-linked glycosylated in the intact protein using solid-phase extraction of glycopeptides (SPEG) on a robotic workstation, the analysis of these now de-glycosylated peptides by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS), and the comparative analysis of the resulting patterns. By focusing selectively on a few formerly N-linked glycopeptides per serum protein, the complexity of the analyte sample is significantly reduced, and the sensitivity, reproducibility, and throughput of serum proteome analysis are increased compared with the analysis of total tryptic peptides from unfractionated samples. We will explore the feasibility to identify cancer-specific serum proteins in the background of normal variation using a carcinogen-induced skin cancer mouse model. The specific aims are: 1) To develop chemistries and protocols for an automatic robotic system to isolate N-linked glycopeptides from serum in a high throughput and highly reproducible fashion; 2) To develop efficient and reproducible procedures for LC-MS analyses, and sequence identification of discriminatory peptides by tandem mass spectrometry; 3) To explore the feasibility of this method for the identification of distinctive serum peptides specific to cancer-bearing mice in the background of normal variations. If successful, the proposed research could subsequently be used for profiling human serum samples from cancer patients and normal individuals to identify the cancer-associated proteins in serum. The identified biomarkers will open a new paradigm for performing screening and detection of human cancer at early stage and for clinical therapeutic management.",biomarker;biomedical automation;biotechnology;blood proteins;glycopeptides;high throughput technology;laboratory mouse;liquid chromatography mass spectrometry;neoplasm /cancer diagnosis;proteomics;technology /technique development,Hui Zhang,John R Knowlton,113491,113491,2007-04-05T12:04:00Z,2005-06-13T12:06:00Z,2008-05-31T12:05:00Z,RFA-CA-05-002,nofo_RFA-CA-05-002,johns hopkins university,BALTIMORE,MD,UNITED STATES,imat,org_name,False
7R21CA116060-03,R21CA116060,7569614,2006,REVERSIBLE PROMOTER-INSERTION FOR IN VIVO STUDIES OF MELANOMA,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is commonly accepted that the processes underlying the development of cancer are best modeled in vivo. A plethora of methods have been developed for genetic dissection of biological processes in somatic cells in culture; however, the adaptation of these techniques to in vivo use has been very limited. Our earlier experience indicates that reversible promoter-insertion mutagenesis offers a number of advantages over the currently used forward genetics techniques for cultured cells. The most important benefits are the dominant nature of the mutations, and the ease of identifying the affected gene and establishing the causal link between the mutation and the phenotype. The principal limitation for the adaptation of this technique to in vivo studies is the delivery of the insertional mutagen (typically, a retroviral vector) to the desired cell type. Based on our recent experience and published data from others, we propose a method to circumvent this limitation via the use of specially engineered transposon vectors. We propose to apply our technique to study the genetic events underlying melanoma development. We will screen for genetic events that cooperate with oncogenic Ras (commonly found in melanomas) in this process. We will confirm the properties of the proposed insertional mutagens in culture and then proceed to establish mouse strains suitable for mutagenesis. Upon verifying the properties of our constructs in vivo, we will selectively mutagenize melanocytes in transgenic animals and will test the functional link between tumorigenesis and the inserted promoter. Confirmed hits will be the subject of future investigation, while the technique itself will become available for dissection of various biological phenomena in general and aspects of tumorigenesis, in particular.",biomarker;biotechnology;cell line;gene mutation;genetically modified animals;guanine nucleotide binding protein;laboratory mouse;melanocyte;melanoma;neoplasm /cancer genetics;oncogenes;technology /technique development;tetracyclines;tissue /cell culture;transfection /expression vector;transposon /insertion element,Eugene S Kandel,Jennifer A.

7R21CA123018-03,R21CA123018,7797760,2007,Epigenetic Targeting in Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hypermethylation of promoter CpG islands plays a prominent role in cancer. In partnership with alterations in histone acetylation/methylation, this epigenetic event establishes a repressive chromatin structure that leads to silencing of key cancer-related genes. The occurrence of DNA methylation within the genome is not random, but rather patterns of methylation are generated that are gene and tumor type specific. How DNA methylation patterns are established is still poorly understood. Since various transcriptional factors or regulators are found in association with DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) in vivo, we hypothesize that: 1) Oncogenic transcription factors can recruit DNMTs to target gene promoters and define a unique epigenetic signature in tumor cells; 2) Dissecting such complex epigenetic hierarchy will identify novel molecular targets for diagnosis, prognosis and therapeutic intervention. To test our hypothesis, we developed a high throughput technique for genome wide analysis of DNA methylation associated with specific proteins such as histones, transcription factors or any DNA binding proteins. The new approach named ChlP-Chop-DMH will combine both genome wide location analysis (also known as ChlP-on-Chip) and Differential Methylation Hybridization (DMH) analysis, two emerging technologies used in epigenetic research. The proposed method has distinct advantages over current protocols: first, this method directly examines the in vivo interaction of specific proteins with methylated DNA throughout the genome; second, this method may uncover novel biological properties of transcription factors; third, this method can be applied to discover novel epigenetic biomarkers relevant to tumorigenesis. In preliminary studies, we have verified the utility of this method with methylated histone H3 at lysine 9 and lysine 4 in human cancer cells. In the R21 phase, we will continue minor refinement of the method and pursue three aims: 1) Improve and optimize the ChlP-Chop-DMH method for analyzing genome wide association of DNA methylation with histone modification; 2) Utilize the proposed method to investigate the association of DNA methylation with chromatin remodeling factors: 3) Show proof-of-concept using the array to examine primary non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHLs). In this development phase we will focus on the sensitivity, reproducibility and accuracy of the proposed method. In the R33 phase, our goal is to utilize the technology to test biological hypotheses. We will fully implement the method and pursue these aims: 1) Discover epigenetic target genes associated with known oncogenic transcription factors c-Myc and BCL6: 2) Validate the identified epigenetic targets and investigate the regulatory role of the associated oncogenic transcription factors.

7R21CA173303-03,R21CA173303,8819875,2013,Controlled premature termination of translation to generate designated truncated,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many diseases, including several forms of cancer, depend on the inappropriate expression of pathological proteins, such as oncogenes. Frequently, the structure-function of these proteins belies a modular construction, with an essential functional domain in the C-terminal portion of the protein (for example the transactivation domain of a transcription factor). Mutants lacking the C-terminal domain can have altered and antagonistic functions, and in some cases they can behave as dominant- negative variants. Such variants are sometimes naturally generated by alternative splicing/polyadenylation. However, these are not always present or not easily activatable. A method to specifically induce these dominant negative variants would be highly desirable and have a significant therapeutic potential in a broad range of diseases, including cancer. In order to generate a pre-designed, desirable truncated variant instead of the pathological one we propose development of a novel universal methodology, based on a brand new design of antisense molecules that are able to redirect termination of translation from the normally translated full-length ORF to an upstream specified location. These Self-Wrapping Antisense Translation Termination (SWATT) compounds work by introducing an insurmountable steric block that cannot be resolved by the helicase activity of incoming translating ribosomes, which can normally unwind extensive secondary structures within the pre-mRNA. This roadblock would thus result in ribosome drop-off and expression of a shorter, C-terminally truncated variant. We will validate the viability of this novel strategy by assessing SWATT compounds on specifically designed reporter luciferase constructs and, eventually, by showing their biological relevance using Notch signaling as a proof-of-principle substrate in cancer cells. Induction of a C-Terminal dominant negative version of Notch, lacking the intracellular signaling domain, should inhibit Notch signaling by engaging Notch ligands in non-productive interactions, and thus prevent its oncogenic functions. SWATT compounds will provide an additional tool to dissect the structure-function properties of proteins in their physiological contexts, and they wil constitute the basis for a novel therapeutic approach in the treatment of cancer and other diseases.",,Luca Cartegni,John R Knowlton,190139,190139,2014-05-07T12:05:00Z,2012-09-20T12:09:00Z,2015-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-12-002,nofo_RFA-CA-12-002,"rutgers, the state univ of n.j.",PISCATAWAY,NJ,UNITED STATES,imat,org_name,False
7R21CA177395-03,R21CA177395,9188276,2015,A novel single-molecule telomere characterization technology for analyzing cancer,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Single-telomere-specific (TTAGGG)n tract lengths and instabilities cannot be measured globally using current methods; the ability to do so would be a major, transformative addition to the arsenal of tools for analyzing critical telomere loss an telomere elongation events in cancer. The shortest telomere or a small subset of the shortest telomeres in a cell will determine the onset of senescence, apoptosis, or genome instability; single (TTAGGG)n tracts are crucial for the function of telomeres and the biological effects of telomere attrition and dysfunction. Telomere loss, breakage, fusion, and rejoining are highly elevated in cancer, but current methods for detecting and measuring these mutational events at the molecular level are limited and low-throughput. The technology we propose to develop here would permit quantitative, single- allele-resolution measurements of telomere length and instability, enabling unprecedented insights into the role(s) telomere loss, telomere breakage/re-joining, and telomerase or ALT dependent telomere elongation play in carcinogenesis, including mechanistic insights into molecular events mediating these processes and translational insights for the potential prognostic and tumor stratification applicability of the methods. In this method, input genomic DNA is labeled with fluorescent dyes specific for (TTAGGG)n sequences and for linked subtelomeric DNA. The labeled individual DNA fragments are linearized (stretched) and imaged in the nano-channels of Bionano Genomics system at very high throughput. The lengths of the telomere are measured accurately and the distances between probes in the subtelomere region are determined accurately to infer the identity of the telomere. Our goals for this R21 study are to establish feasibility for (1) high-throughput single-molecule detection and quantitation of (TTAGGG)n tracts in genomic DNA samples and (2) subtelomere probe development and efficient co-labeling of telomeres and subtelomeres in the context of total genomic DNA, including conversion of the labeled DNA to double- stranded DNA suitable for nano-channel analysis; and (3) proof-of-principle results for the technology and its applicability for cancer research using data generated and analyzed for a normal and a cancer cell line. There are significant technical challenges inherent in this early-stage technology development project, but the extraordinary payoff for cancer research will be a high-throughput ability to probe mechanisms of telomere length regulation and telomere mutation at single-telomere resolution, in small (ultimately single-cell) samples of both dividing and non-dividing cells.",,Harold Riethman; Ming Xiao,Jerry Li,125192,125192,2016-01-21T12:01:00Z,2014-05-13T12:05:00Z,2017-04-30T12:04:00Z,RFA-CA-13-001,nofo_RFA-CA-13-001,old dominion university,NORFOLK,VA,UNITED STATES,imat,org_name,False
7R21CA193064-02,R21CA193064,9114273,2015,Cellular biofactories for therapeutic protein synthesis in tumor microenvironment,"﻿ DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): T cells undergo an intelligent decision-making process based on the inhibitory and excitatory chemotactic inputs; and extravagate to the tumor microenvironment through solid tissue barriers. Investigators' long-term goal, to be pursued in R33 phase, is to develop T cells into a platform vector technology for active drug- transport to the solid tumors. In this R21 application, their objective is to engineer a robust mechanism to transform autologous T cells into biofactories for autonomous synthesis of cytocidal secretory proteins upon stimulation by the tumor cells. Autonomous synthesis of Protein-of-Interest (PoI) with spatiotemporal resolution will enable targeting of tumor burden with cellular resolution and molecular specificity. Their central hypothesis is that T cells can be genetically encoded for robust modulation and biosynthesis of therapeutic proteins at the tumor site. They have chosen ovarian cancer that expresses Folate Receptor alpha (FRa) as disease model, and an apoptotic protein for its cytotoxic therapeutic value. However, the rationale for developing T cells as protein biofactories is that this is a platform technology and their specificity can be modified to target any cancer and autonomously synthesize any PoI in situ. To aid this R21 effort, they have developed cell lines expressing bioluminescent and fluorescent reporters expressed only when stimulated by tumor cells. With following specific aims, they will advance this project towards its goals: (1) To develop robust control on biosynthesis of protein-of-interest (PoI); (2) To develop T cells as biofactories for autonomous secretion of antitumor apoptotic protein. It is expected that this R21 phase will lead to T cells that will not activate in healthy tissues (enhanced safety) and hyperactivate specifically in the tumor microenvironment (enhanced efficacy). The impact of this research will also be felt on ongoing T-cell therapy trials by reducing the incidences of graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD). This pioneering approach builds upon ongoing T-cell immunotherapy trials, which are currently limited to control minimal residual disease (MRD) and is administered after chemotherapy. Proposed research is transformative, firstly because it will expand the scope of T-cell engineering to replace systemic chemotherapies. This will then be used for reduction of tumor burden rather than keeping MRD in check. Secondly, therapeutic proteins of non-human origin are efficiently degraded and removed by the immune system. This is a barrier to their in vivo application. The use of autologous T cells for biosynthesis of therapeutic proteins at the target site will eliminate any immunogenicity issues. Unusually high impact is expected because the specificity of T cells can be redirected towards the surface markers on different cancers and therefore be used to target multitude of cancers.",Address;Amidohydrolases;Anabolism;Antigen Targeting;Antigens;Apoptotic;Autologous;Cell Line;Cytoplasm;Decision Making;Development;Disease model;Drug Delivery Systems;Drug Transport;Engineering;Foundations;Future;Goals;IL6 gene;Immune system;Immunosuppressive Agents;Immunotherapy;In Situ;Incidence;Injection of therapeutic agent;Intercellular Fluid;Lead;Malignant Neoplasms;Malignant neoplasm of ovary;Mission;Molecular;Penicillin G;Permeability;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phase;Process;Prodrugs;Protein Biosynthesis;Proteins;Public Health;Regulation;Reporter;Reporting;Research;Research Personnel;Residual Neoplasm;Resolution;Response Elements;Safety;Site;Solid;Solid Neoplasm;Specificity;Surface;System;T cell response;T cell therapy;T-Cell Development;T-Cell Immunologic Specificity;T-Lymphocyte;Technology;Therapeutic;Therapy trial;Tissues;Transgenes;Tumor Antigens;Tumor Burden;Work;amidase;base;cellular engineering;chemotherapy;chimeric antigen receptor;cytotoxic;graft vs host disease;human FOLR1 protein;immunogenicity;in vivo;interest;nanoparticle;neoplastic cell;nuclear factors of activated T-cells;pressure;prevent;promoter;public health relevance;secretory protein;spatiotemporal;success;therapeutic protein;tumor;tumor microenvironment;tumor specificity;vector,Parijat Bhatnagar,Tawnya C Mckee,271339,271339,2015-08-12T12:08:00Z,2015-06-01T12:06:00Z,2018-05-31T12:05:00Z,RFA-CA-14-003,nofo_RFA-CA-14-003,sri international,MENLO PARK,CA,UNITED STATES,imat,org_name,False
7R21CA196418-04,R21CA196418,9566479,2017,"Multiplexed, Quantitative Fluorescence Imaging in Tumor Sections","﻿ DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Precision medicine for cancer requires knowledge of the driver mutations in a particular patient's tumor. Recent single cell genetic studies have shown that driver mutations and cancer cell subtype are highly heterogeneous within a single patient. Thus, clinicians will need to employ experimental methods that allow observation of a variety of molecular analytes across many individual cells within a particular patient's tumor section in situ. Current tumor section analyses are not highly multiplexed and typically remain limited to ~4-5 analytes, or 7 with multi-spectral imaging. Recent technologies have pushed this number into 30s-60s, but they require expensive equipment and/or reagents, sophisticated analyses or markedly increased assay time, all of which would preclude their practical use in many clinical pathology and preclinical research laboratories. Thus, there remains a significant need for technologies that multiplex measurements in tumor sections but are widely accessible and cost-effective. We focus on addressing this need with a readily-adoptable but novel multi- spectral fluorescence-based method. It is based on the hypothesis that the power of combinatorics can be harnessed to vastly increase the number of quantifiable analytes in a mixture by permuting the wide array of available fluorophores in new ways. We term our approach combinatorial fluorescence with spectral imaging (CoFSI). CoFSI only requires the ability to perform multi-channel fluorescence excitation and emission spectral scanning, which is widely available and easy to implement in most plate/slide readers and many microscopes. Data analysis involves a straightforward, fast computational technique called linear unmixing. Preliminary simulation studies suggest that the concentrations of 123 different CoFSI probes constructed from 16 existing fluorescent proteins can be estimated simultaneously with good accuracy and precision across 3 orders of concentration magnitude with a large number of excitation channels, and 48 probes with 6 excitation channels. Similar simulation studies constrained by available tumor section imaging equipment and Alexa dyes suggest 25 simultaneous measurements are possible. Initial pilot experiments demonstrate that seven different CoFSI probe levels in a mixture can be measured both accurately and precisely using only the blue-yellow part of the spectrum. This proposal further tests the limits of CoFSI experimentally, and applies CoFSI to tumor section imaging, with two Aims: (1) Quantify the Levels of 48 Fluorescent Probes in a Mixture Simultaneously; and (2) Quantify the Spatial Distribution of 25 Analytes in Tumor Sections. If successful, CoFSI can increase quantitative fluorescence multiplexing at least ~5 to 10-fold while relying on standard lab resources and straightforward analyses.

7R21CA202831-04,R21CA202831,9753479,2018,Novel Bi-functional Inhibitors Blocking OncomiR Biogenesis,"﻿ DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this proposal is to develop a new class of selective miRNA regulators that blocks the maturation of oncomiRs. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate diverse biological processes. Dysregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) has become one of the emerging mechanisms contributes to cancer formation and progression. Increasing evidences suggest that certain miRNAs affect cellular transformation, carcinogenesis and metastasis, and act as oncogenes (oncogenic miRNAs or oncomiRs). Understanding the roles of oncomiRs in cancer will lead to the development of new cancer therapies. Besides, direct therapeutic intervention of oncomiRs has become a promising new direction for treating cancer. For both research and therapeutic purposes, methods allowing the control of oncomiR levels are highly desirable. Current methods for such purposes generally suffer from the off-target inhibition. To address this critical issue, we propose a novel strategy to regulate miRNA. We will develop a new class of bi-functional miRNA regulators consisting of independent and specialized ""pre-miRNA recognition unit"" and ""Dicer inhibition unit"" to target unique pre- miRNAs and block their processing to generate mature miRNAs by inhibiting Dicer enzymatic activity. The following Aims will accomplish our goal of establishing this new strategy: Aim 1. Synthesize and test bi- functional miRNA regulators. We will synthesize bi-functional regulators for miRNA-21 (miR-21) and other oncomiRs and test their inhibitory activity. Aim 2: Test the activity and specificity of the bi-functional miRNA regulator in cells. We will optimize cellular uptake of the regulator in mammalian cells. The cellular activity and off-target effects of the regulator will be evaluated in cells. This work will establish the technical foundation of a novel oncomiR regulation strategy. This unique technology will address the major obstacle encountered in current miRNA regulating methods and enhance the capability to dissect the roles of oncomiRs in cancer biology. It will significantly contribute to the advancement in our knowledge of the role played by oncomiRs in cancer and will result in the development of novel cancer therapies either directly based on the bi- modular regulators or evolved from the understanding of oncomiR functions unveiled by this new technology.",Address;Adverse effects;Affect;Affinity;Antisense Oligonucleotides;Binding;Biogenesis;Biological Assay;Biological Process;Cancer Biology;Cell physiology;Cells;Development;Dicer Enzyme;Foundations;Generations;Goals;In Vitro;Knowledge;Link;Malignant Neoplasms;Mammalian Cell;Messenger RNA;Methods;MicroRNAs;Neoplasm Metastasis;Northern Blotting;Oncogenes;Oncogenic;Pathogenesis;Play;Proteins;Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR;RNA;Regulation;Research;Role;Specificity;Technology;Testing;Therapeutic;Therapeutic Intervention;Untranslated RNA;Western Blotting;Work;base;cancer therapy;cancer type;carcinogenesis;design;improved;inhibitor/antagonist;interest;metaplastic cell transformation;new technology;next generation;novel;novel strategies;novel therapeutics;public health relevance;research and development;ribosome profiling;transcriptome sequencing;uptake,Fu-Sen Liang,Jennifer A.

7R21CA229044-03,R21CA229044,10253467,2020,Novel Platform linking cancer-specific glycosylation with cell signaling outcomes,ABSTRACT Abnormal glycosylation is a hallmark of many cancers that contributes to tumor growth and invasion. There are many protein receptors that are regulated abnormally in cancer due to mutations and/or alterations in glycosylation. Studies to link specific glycosylation changes to signaling outcomes have primarily focused on studies of individual receptors or specific pathways. Methods that can link forms of tumor-specific glycosylation to global effects on signaling pathway activation are needed to better identify potential new targets for therapeutics. To overcome this limitation we are employing the use of heterobifunctional molecule that will link cancer-specific glycosylation on protein receptors with a proximity- induced ubiquitination. To demonstrate the potential and applicability of this method we are using a novel scFv antibody that recognizes tumor-specific glycans present on ovarian cancer and glioblastoma cells that has been demonstrated to have excellent cell permeability. Combining the scFv with proteolysis targeting molecules will enable us to identify receptors and signaling changes using mass spectrometry methods. Successful completion of this project will establish a new platform useful for both basic science research and clinical therapeutic development.,Address;Animal Model;Antibodies;Area;Basic Science;Binding;Cancer Control;Cell Line;Cell Surface Proteins;Cell surface;Cells;Chimera organism;Clinical;Development;Evolution;Feasibility Studies;Future;Glioblastoma;Global Change;Glycoproteins;Goals;Growth;HIF1A gene;Human;In Vitro;Incubated;Individual;Knowledge;Ligands;Link;Longevity;Malignant - descriptor;Malignant Neoplasms;Malignant neoplasm of ovary;Maps;Mass Spectrum Analysis;Mediating;Membrane Proteins;Methods;Mutation;Outcome;Output;Pathway interactions;Peptide Hydrolases;Permeability;Polysaccharides;Post-Translational Protein Processing;Protein Glycosylation;Proteins;Proteolysis;Receptor Signaling;Research;Research Personnel;Research Proposals;Scientist;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;Specificity;Stains;Structure;Testing;Therapeutic;Tumor Cell Invasion;Tumor Tissue;Ubiquitin;Ubiquitination;Xenograft Model;cancer cell;cancer therapy;chimeric antibody;clinical application;clinical implementation;glycosylation;improved;in vivo;innovation;intraperitoneal;method development;migration;mutant;new therapeutic target;novel;receptor;small hairpin RNA;subcutaneous;sugar;therapeutic development;tool;tumor;tumor growth;tumor xenograft;tumorigenesis,Karen L.

7R33CA083220-03,R33CA083220,6704389,2002,FOUR COLOR ARRAY BOUND SNP/MUTATION DETECTION IN CANCER,"DESCRIPTION: (Applicant's Description) Development of cost-effective, high-throughput sampling coupled to rapid, parallel DNA profiling methods will facilitate molecular analysis of normal and diseased states. This R21/R33 initiative focuses on detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and point mutations in cancer. Our goals are as follows: Milestones/Aims for the R21 phase include: 1) Development of a robust, 4-color rhodamine BigDye terminators-based single nucleotide extension (SNE) array assay which will allow DNA TaqFS-catalyzed, single nucleotide extension to detect a wide variety of SNPs/mutations associated with human cancer. We will increase signal intensity as well as eliminate the need for synthesis of costly spacers on array-bound probes by using dendrimer-coated surfaces; and, 2) Scale-up the assay to simultaneously monitor 30-50 SNPs/mutations on a single array. Multiplexing will be done both at PCR and SNE steps and use of total genomic DNA targets will be tested. Strategies will also be implemented to screen multiple individuals on a single chip for the same mutation. Aims for the R33 phase include: 1) Application of SNE assay to type SNPs within and flanking the minimal deleted region in lp, llq and 14q in neuroblastoma pediatric patients. The assay will facilitate identification of deletion location and extent and eventually will facilitate understanding the relationship between genotype and phenotype; and 2) Identification of single-base changes occurring within the mutation cluster region of adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and in sporadic colorectal cancer. We will also evaluate genotype/phenotype relationships using information from SNE-based mutation analyses and results from array-based genome-wide mRNA expression profiles already funded by an NCI Contract. Array-based results generated from Aims 1 and 2 will be compared and contrasted to data available from previously typed individuals using more traditional DNA analysis approaches as well as to solution-phase results generated at PE-Biosystems. Development and validation of array-bound approaches for monitoring DNA changes in cancer should facilitate high throughput, parallel processing of samples for critical human cancer genes. In addition, it will help establish basic knowledge required to rapidly define the molecular basis of specific malignancies and eventually provide a foundation for rational molecular assessment of therapeutic.",adenomatous polyps; biotechnology; clinical research; colorectal neoplasms; diagnostic tests; fluorescent dye /probe; genetic polymorphism; high throughput technology; human subject; microarray technology; neoplasm /cancer genetics; neuroblastoma; point mutation; polymerase chain reaction,Paolo M Fortina,,388816,388816,,2000-09-26T12:09:00Z,2005-04-30T12:04:00Z,PAR-99-100,nofo_PAR-99-100,thomas jefferson university,PHILADELPHIA,PA,UNITED STATES,imat,org_name,False
7R33CA083232-04,R33CA083232,6745552,2003,APTAMER BASED DETECTOR TO QUANTIFY MACROMOLECULES,"DESCRIPTION: (Applicant's Description) We propose to develop a technology to simultaneously detect and quantify large numbers individual proteins and post-translationally modified proteins. This technology will be based on a spatially-arrayed aptamer microchip and sensitive fluorescence-based optical detection techniques. The system will provide a powerful new tool for biomedical research and diagnosis of diseases and cancers. Currently, the levels of cellular proteins are inferred from cellular mRNA levels by using DNA oligonucleotide microchips. These microchips allow the detection of mRNA levels by base-pairing interactions to homologous DNA oligomers located at different sites in the microchip array. However, this indirect assay of protein levels suffers from two problems: First, mRNA levels may not accurately reflect the level of encoded protein because translation and degradation rates vary from protein to protein and are regulated in response to cell physiology. Second, post-translational modifications proteins often alter critical protein activities. This technology we propose to develop is comprised of three parts: 1) Aptamers with high-affinity and high-specifity for individual proteins. These aptamers will be designed to have ligand-dependent changes in fluorescence properties. 2) A microchip array with each array site occupied by aptamers against a different target molecule. 3) An evanescent field fluorescence detector which detects target molecules binding to aptamers at the array sites. Our proposal includes plans for: 1) selection of aptamers that can discriminate between different post-translational modifications of the same protein; 2) development of fluorescence-based techniques for detecting oligonucleotide:protein interactions; 3) design and construction of an optimized fluorescence detector; 4) scaling up methods to allow large numbers of independent aptamer selections against different proteins; 5) construction of a prototype protein chip.",macromolecule; messenger RNA; microprocessor /microchip; oligonucleotides; posttranslational modifications; proteins; technology /technique development,Andrew D Ellington,John R Knowlton,678625,678625,2004-06-25T12:06:00Z,2003-06-01T12:06:00Z,2007-05-31T12:05:00Z,PAR-99-100,nofo_PAR-99-100,university of texas at austin,AUSTIN,TX,UNITED STATES,imat,org_name,False
7R33CA088343-05,R33CA088343,6800243,2003,FLUORESCENT TAGS TARGETED ON CELL SURFACE CARBOHYDRATES,"Malignant transformation is often associated with alteration of cell surface carbohydrates. The expression or over-expression of certain carbohydrates, such as sialyl Lewis X (sLex), sialyl Lewis a (sLea), Lewis X (Lex) and Lewis Y (Ley), has been correlated with the development of certain cancers. These cell surface carbohydrates can be used for cell-specific identification and targeting of carcinoma cells. The long-term goal of this project is the development of small molecule artificial receptors which can recognize target carbohydrate structures with high selectivity and affinity. Such receptors could be used for the development of fluorescent tags for cell- specific identification, tissue-specific imaging (such as MRI), and targeted delivery of therapeutic agents. In this study, we will use sLex as the model carbohydrate and use colon cancer as the model biological system because the expression of sLex is often associated with progression and metastasis of colon cancer. The short-term objective of this application is to develop tissue-specific fluorescent tags (sensors) which can recognize sLex with high affinity and selectivity. For the construction of such fluorescent sensors, we plan to use an integrated approach combining template-directed synthesis, combinatorial chemistry, and computer molecular modeling aided design. The sLex-specific artificial receptors have the potential to be used for cell identification, detection and tagging for the purpose of localization, staging, tissue biopsy, and fluorescence-directed surgical removal of colon cancer cells. Such tissue-specific compounds could also serve as vehicles for targeted delivery of cancer chemotherapeutic agents. These small molecule sensors may also have the following advantages over antibody-based detection/delivery systems: (1) greater stability during storage and in vivo; (2) increased permeability through biological membranes and, therefore, enhanced target accessibility; (3) intrinsic sensitivity to binding with significant fluorescence intensity increases, making detection and visualization easier and more suitable for high throughout screening, and (4) lower propensity to elicit undesirable immune responses. Similar methods, once developed, could also be used for the construction of fluorescent tags for other cell surface carbohydrates implicated in human malignancies.",carbohydrates; chemical models; colon neoplasms; combinatorial chemistry; computer simulation; drug design /synthesis /production; fluorescent dye /probe; surface antigens; tissue /cell culture,Binghe Wang,John R Knowlton,288000,288000,2003-09-15T12:09:00Z,2000-07-01T12:07:00Z,2005-06-30T12:06:00Z,PAR-99-100,nofo_PAR-99-100,georgia state university,ATLANTA,GA,UNITED STATES,imat,org_name,False
7R33CA092752-04,R33CA092752,7485498,2007,Fast Mutation Detection by Tandem SSCP/HA on Microchips,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is proposed to optimize, evaluate, and pilot rapid, scalable, and low-cost microchip electrophoresis technologies for sensitive and specific molecular detection of cancer by tandem single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP)/heteroduplex analysis (HA), using the p53 gene as a model system. We request a 1-year R21 phase and a 3-year R33 phase. The proposed project involves collaboration between members of Northwestern's Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center, including researchers in Chemical Engineering, the Medical School, and Evanston Hospital. Microchannel ""tandem"" SSCP/HA is a novel mutation detection method recently developed in our laboratory, which involves the simultaneous generation and analysis of homo/heteroduplex DNA and SSCP conformers. Studies of a significant number of samples (32) indicate that tandem SSCP/HA allows for much higher-sensitivity mutation detection (100%) than SSCP alone (93%) or HA alone (75%), for p53 samples. We have developed and published optimized sample preparation protocols, gel formulations, and analysis conditions for capillary array electrophoresis (CAE). During the R21 phase, we will translate these methods to microfluidic electrophoresis chips, which offer a large increase in throughput and drop in cost of DNA analysis compared to CAE. The p53 gene, known to be mutated in >50% of human cancers, and whose mutation status can be predictive of patient response to chemotherapy, is the important model system chosen. However, microchip-based genetic analysis technologies to be developed should be easily applied to ANY cancer-related gene. In the R21 phase, we will analyze approximately 60 different DNA samples derived from tumor cell lines, representing a range of mutations in different p53 exons, to determine the impact of DNA sample characteristics and electrophoresis protocols on the sensitivity and specificity of the method, in a blinded study designed by collaborating biostatisticians. When optimized tandem SSCP/HA protocols have been developed for microchips, they will be piloted by the analysis of >200 selected samples amplified from frozen, solid tumors banked at Evanston Hospital. Via this blinded study, sensitivity and specificity (both expected to be at or near 100%) will be determined and reported for the first time using banked tumor tissue, providing necessary validation for clinical application of this technique, and making rapid, low-cost cancer genotyping technology widely available to physicians.",Address;Admixture;Affect;Age;Biological;Biological Assay;Biological Models;Blinded;Blood capillaries;Cancer Detection;Cancer Patient;Cancer cell line;Capillary Electrophoresis;Characteristics;Chemical Engineering;Clinical;Collaborations;Comprehensive Cancer Center;Condition;Cost Analysis;DNA;DNA Fingerprinting;DNA Sequence;DNA Sequence Alteration;DNA analysis;Data;Detection;Devices;Disease-Free Survival;Drops;Drug Formulations;Economics;Effectiveness;Electrophoresis;Elements;Ensure;Evaluation;Exons;Fluorescence;Freezing;Funding;Gel;Generations;Genes;Genomics;Glass;Heteroduplex Analysis;Homo;Hospitals;Human;Hybridization Array;Immunohistochemistry;Individual;Laboratories;Lasers;Length;Link;Malignant Neoplasms;Mammary Neoplasms;Medical;Methodology;Methods;Microchip Electrophoresis;Microfluidic Microchips;Microfluidics;Migration Assay;Molecular;Mutate;Mutation;Mutation Detection;Negative Axillary Lymph Node;Neoplasm Metastasis;Normal Cell;Numbers;Outcome;Patients;Pattern;Phase;Physicians;Plastics;Polymers;Positive Lymph Node;Preparation;Primary Neoplasm;Probability;Process;Protein p53;Protocols documentation;Publishing;Range;Rate;Recurrence;Reporting;Research Design;Research Personnel;Running;Sampling;Screening procedure;Sensitivity and Specificity;Series;Single-Stranded Conformational Polymorphism;Single-Stranded DNA;Solid Neoplasm;Specimen;Staining method;Stains;Standards of Weights and Measures;Statistically Significant;TP53 gene;Techniques;Technology;Temperature;Tissue Sample;Translating;Tube;Tumor Bank;Tumor Cell Line;Tumor Suppressor Genes;Tumor Tissue;Tumor-Derived;Validation;Work;anticancer research;base;blind;cancer therapy;capillary;chemotherapy;clinical application;clinically relevant;conformer;cost;design;ds-DNA;electric field;genetic analysis;genotyping technology;innovative technologies;interest;malignant breast neoplasm;medical schools;member;micro-total analysis system;microchip;migration;mutant;novel;outcome forecast;response;success;time use;tumor,Annelise Emily Barron,Avraham Rasooly,173000,173000,2007-12-14T12:12:00Z,2007-12-14T12:12:00Z,2009-05-31T12:05:00Z,PAR-01-106,nofo_PAR-01-106,stanford university,STANFORD,CA,UNITED STATES,imat,org_name,False
7R33CA094340-03,R33CA094340,6963204,2004,Identification of serum glycosylation markers of HCC,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) (and/or hepatitis C virus) is the major etiology of hepatocellular cancer (HCC). In the United States, chronic hepatitis B and C account for about 30%- 40% of HCC and, worldwide, more than 350 million people are chronically infected with either HBV or HCV. Alteration in the oligosaccharides associated with glycoproteins and glycolipids is one of the many molecular changes that accompany malignant transformations. However, accurate and reliable detection and quantification of oligosaccharides has been technically very difficult or time consuming. It is well established that in HCC there is an elevation in the amount of fucosylated oligosaccharides associated with a-fetal protein (AFP). The increase of a l-6-fucosylated glycans is due, in part, to an abnormal secretion system and other proteins have been shown to be aberrantly glycosylated. However, no systematic analysis has been carried out to identify all the proteins that have an increase in fucosylation. Our hypothesis is that by combining our high throughput oligosaccharide sequencing methodology with our laboratory's proteome expertise, we will be able to use lectin extraction methods to purify and identify fucosylated glycoproteins from HCC sera. Hence, proof of principle experiments will be carried out in the R21 phase using cultured liver cells to demonstrate the utility of the technology; while in the R33 phase the technology will be evaluated in a pilot study using sera obtained from woodchuck, a well established animal model of HBV induced HCC. It is anticipated that this methodology will allow the identification of an array of molecules that show increased fucosylation in HCC. These proteins may be then further evaluated as members of a fucose index to act as a surrogate marker for HCC progression.

7R33CA105295-03,R33CA105295,7141498,2005,Ovarian Cancer Screening Using Comprehensive Proteomics,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The development of biomarkers for earlier detection of ovarian cancer will greatly improve survival. Most women present with advanced stage disease with survival rates of roughly 20%. Advances in the field of proteomics now provide the tools necessary to effectively analyze the serum proteome, and the application of such technologies holds great promise for determining novel biomarkers. This proposal outlines methods to comprehensively discover, identify, quantify, and validate a panel of specific and sensitive ovarian cancer biomarkers for early detection. We propose the following Specific Aims: 1. Determine candidate ovarian cancer biomarkers defined by comprehensive biomarker analysis of serum. Emphasis will be placed on refining the most effective overall analytical strategy for comprehensive and reproducible measurements. Spectral peaks that most accurately distinguish cancer vs. control will be identified using high-resolving power technology. Biostatistics and bioinformatics will be used to prioritize candidate markers (according to specificity, sensitivity and predictive value) for further characterization. 2. Identification and absolute quantification of the candidate biomarkers. This will improve reliability and high-throughput capabilities in subsequent validation testing, and the identification of these proteins will contribute further to research into the biologic basis of the disease. We will use accurate mass measurements, tandem mass spectrometry, and non-redundant protein and genome databases applied to distinct selected controls. Furthermore, we will determine the range of values for both normal and cancer serum samples using stable isotope labeled internal standards. 3. Clinical validation of a panel of biomarkers in specific groups of women. Sera from defined cohorts of women will be used to accurately determine the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of individual and combinations of candidate markers in all aspects of disease (early/late stage, familial, remission and recurrence) and in large numbers of non-cancer controls.",biomarker;clinical research;early diagnosis;female;high throughput technology;human middle age (35-64);human old age (65+);human subject;interview;mass spectrometry;menopause;neoplasm /cancer classification /staging;neoplasm /cancer diagnosis;neoplasm /cancer epidemiology;neoplasm /cancer relapse /recurrence;ovary neoplasms;protein quantitation /detection;proteomics;serum;stable isotope;women&apos;s health,David C.

7R33CA105514-04,R33CA105514,7271419,2007,Assaying Tyrosine Kinase Activity: A New Paradigm,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): New approaches are needed in the molecular analyses of the growth-promoting signal transduction pathways involved in the development and maintenance of cancer. The Laser Micropipet System (LMS), a new technology for the biochemical assay of kinases, holds the promise of directly assaying the activities of protein tyrosine kinases in primary patient cells. The LMS was developed for the assay of serine/threonine kinases in individual cells grown in tissue culture. This R21/R33 application proposes to expand the applications of this instrumentation to directly determine the activity of oncogenic tyrosine kinases in primary cells from patients. Assay of Bcr-Abl in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) will demonstrate the power of this tool for research, clinical, and pharmacologic applications. While this assay will be of value in the study of the biology and resistance mechanisms in CML, the studies will lay the groundwork for a new paradigm in the study of molecular mechanisms in cancer signal transduction and will have general applicability. The R21 phase of this proposal is designed to establish the feasibility of assaying Bcr-Abl activity and to demonstrate the necessary assay conditions for measurements in cells derived from a patient with CML. The specific aims are to: 1) identify and characterize a reporter of intracellular Bcr-Ab1 kinase activity, 2) define and optimize conditions for measuring Bcr-Ab1 activity in human cells, 3) compare reporter phosphorylation in cells expressing Bcr-Ab1 vs. cells lacking this kinase, and 4) demonstrate the feasibility of using primary patient cells in kinase assays. The goal of the R33 phase is to demonstrate the potential for the LMS-based kinase assay in applications for the study of the biology of pharmacologic resistance in CML, including from primary patient cells. The R33 specific aims are to: 1) develop a membrane-permeant Bcr-Ab1 kinase reporter, 2) demonstrate the ability to detect imatinib resistance in CML cell lines, 3) determine Bcr-Ab1 activity in primary cells from patients with CML and their response to pharmacologic inhibition, and 4) determine if the assay can detect the emergence of imatinib resistance in CML patients and can differentiate the mechanisms of drug resistance.",Biochemical;Biological Assay;Biology;Cell Line;Cells;Chronic Myeloid Leukemia;Clinical;Condition;Development;Drug resistance;Goals;Growth;Human;Imatinib;Individual;Lasers;Maintenance;Malignant Neoplasms;Measurement;Measures;Membrane;Molecular;Oncogenic;Patients;Phase;Phosphorylation;Phosphotransferases;Protein Tyrosine Kinase;Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases;Reporter;Research;Resistance;Signal Transduction;Signal Transduction Pathway;System;base;design;instrumentation;new technology;novel strategies;resistance mechanism;response;tissue culture;tool,Christopher E Sims,Min-Kyung H Song,310218,310218,2007-07-23T12:07:00Z,2005-08-08T12:08:00Z,2009-07-31T12:07:00Z,PAR-01-106,nofo_PAR-01-106,univ of north carolina chapel hill,CHAPEL HILL,NC,UNITED STATES,imat,org_name,False
7R33CA107943-05,R33CA107943,7755719,2008,A Novel Proteomics Technology for Protein Farnesylation,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The identification and characterization of changes in the level of farnesylated proteins in response to the treatment of farnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTIs), a newly introduced family of antitumor agents currently undergoing clinical evaluation, represents a major scientific challenge. Extant proteomics methods are limited to quantifying a few thousands of the most abundant proteins and, therefore, are unsuitable for the targeted profiling of less abundant farnesylated expression. The major goal of this application is to develop and validate a powerful technology, Tagging via Azido Substrate (TAS), for the efficient isolation of farnesylated proteins. This technology will then be applied to the proteomics analysis of farnesylated proteins in physiologically relevant models. The TAS technology involves the introduction of a synthetic azide-modified farnesyl substrate, either farnesyl azide diphosphate (FPP-azide) or farnesyl azide alcohol (F-azide-OH), which replaces the natural substrate during cellular protein farnesylation. The resulting farnesyl-azide (F-azide)-modified proteins will be affinity-purified through an azide-specific conjugation reaction (Staudinger reaction) using a phosphine capture reagent linked to photo-cleavable beads, which can then be released by UV light-induced photo-cleavage. Since affinity purification relies on covalent bonding resulting from a specific conjugation reaction between an azide and phosphine capture reagent, other proteins without the F-azide modification can be effectively removed by thorough washing. Thus, the TAS technology will allow farnesylated proteins to be isolated with high yield, high specificity, and low contamination. The initial focus of the R21 portion of this proposal is on the development of TAS technology and its application to the isolation of farnesylated proteins.

7R33CA114149-04,R33CA114149,7455761,2008,Imaging tumor associated fibroblast activation protein,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this research is to develop a novel fibroblast activation protein (FAP) sensing near infrared fluorescence reporter for early tumor detection and tumor classification. FAP is a cell surface antigen of reactive tumor stromal fibroblasts founded in more than 90% of epithelial carcinomas, but it is absent from epithelial carcinoma cells, normal fibroblasts, and other normal human tissue. Supporting tumor stromal fibroblasts are generally localized close to tumor vasculature, which is essential for early tumor development and growth. Thus it has been chosen as a target for monoclonal antibody based tumor therapy. FAP is not only a membrane protein but also a dipeptidyl peptidase. An imaging probe to report enzymatic activity and location of FAP could be extremely useful for early tumor detection. In this application we will develop a small molecular probe with ultra-sensitivity based on a unique class of fluorogenic chromophore that has significant changes in emission at different chemical states. Specifically, the probes emit no fluorescence in their initial intact state but become brightly fluorescent after specific proteolytic reaction. The newly developed low molecular weight, well defined fluorogenic probes are expected to have several advantages for imaging: a) fast tissue distribution allowing earlier imaging after injection, b) fast clearance allowing repeated imaging, and c) high likelihood of developing key candidates into clinically useful agents. The choice of FAP is based on its importance in tumor growth, invasion, and other processes in oncogenesis. Together with recent developments in fluorescence imaging technologies, this research is expected to ultimately result in clinical imaging agents with specificity for targeted enzymes. We believe that the developed approach can be used as a platform to design a broad spectrum of activatable molecular probes to image other amino peptidases in vivo.",Carcinoma;Chemicals;Class;Classification;Clinical;Detection;Development;Dipeptidyl Peptidases;Drug or chemical Tissue Distribution;Enzymes;Fibroblasts;Fluorescence;Goals;Growth and Development function;Image;Imaging technology;Injection of therapeutic agent;Localized;Location;Malignant Epithelial Cell;Membrane Proteins;Molecular Probes;Molecular Weight;Monoclonal Antibodies;Peptide Hydrolases;Process;Reaction;Reporter;Reporting;Research;Specificity;Stromal Neoplasm;Surface Antigens;base;chromophore;design;fibroblast-activating factor;fluorescence imaging;human tissue;imaging probe;in vivo;novel;tumor;tumor growth;tumorigenesis,Ching-Hsuan Tung,James W.

7R33CA173373-03,R33CA173373,9057813,2015,Clinical validation of the HD-CTC fluid biopsy in early detection of lung cancer.,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Currently, the clinical diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) relies on a number of imaging modalities followed by a tissue confirmation with an invasive procedure. This process is somewhat imprecise because a patient's pathologic diagnosis after surgery may be discordant from pre-operative assessment and may contribute to poor patient prognosis since accurately staging early cancers is essential to good outcome. We hypothesize that rigorously validating the recently developed High Definition Circulating Tumor Cell (HD- CTC) Fluid Biopsy in a controlled clinical cohort of patients undergoing evaluation for lung cancer will improve the accuracy of detection and prognosis in early-stage, malignant nodules of the lung with non-small cell lung cancer histology. We will capitalize on NIH-supported proof of concept data, which has demonstrated that the HD-CTC Fluid Biopsy is capable of detecting disease derived cells in the majority of patients at the time of diagnosis. These data now motivate us to investigate the performance of the assay ""the day before diagnosis"" with the expectation of achieving similar results in a more realistic, prospectively designed, clinical study with matched controls consisting of patients who have non-malignant lung nodules. Our aim is to accurately establish the test characteristics of the HD-CTC fluid biopsy in a group of patients undergoing evaluation for lung cancer and to identify those patients with malignant nodules that have detectable HD-CTCs to determine whether the fluid biopsy can augment 1) clinical staging prior to definitive treatment and 2) prognosis after definitive diagnosis and treatment. We will significantly enhance the test by developing single cell molecular analysis to provide definitive characterization. Integrating non-invasive, reliable and accurate circulating biomarkers with the current standard of care will not only allow for the development of more accurate clinical prediction models that are cost-effective, but may also augment our understanding of tumor biology and metastasis using a clinical, in vivo model of early non-small cell lung cancer.",Advanced Development;Biological Assay;Biological Markers;Biology;Biopsy;Blood Tests;Cancer Histology;Caring;Cells;Characteristics;Clinic;Clinical;Clinical Data;Clinical Research;Data;Detection;Development;Diagnosis;Diagnostic;Disease;Emerging Technologies;Enrollment;Epithelial Cells;Evaluation;Fluorescent in Situ Hybridization;Genome;Genomics;Health;Image;Investigation;Liquid substance;Lung nodule;Malignant - descriptor;Malignant Neoplasms;Malignant neoplasm of lung;Malignant neoplasm of pancreas;Malignant neoplasm of prostate;Measures;Medical;Methods;Modeling;Molecular;Molecular Analysis;Morphology;Neoplasm Circulating Cells;Neoplasm Metastasis;Nodule;Non-Malignant;Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma;Operative Surgical Procedures;Outcome;Pathologic;Patients;Performance;Phase;Positron-Emission Tomography;Procedures;Process;Prospective Studies;Proteins;Publishing;Recurrence;Relative (related person);Research Design;Sampling;Specificity;Staging;Staging System;System;Techniques;Technology;Testing;Time;Tissues;Translations;Tumor Biology;United States National Institutes of Health;Validation;Venous blood sampling;anticancer research;case control;clinical Diagnosis;clinically relevant;cohort;cost effective;design;disorder subtype;expectation;imaging modality;immunocytochemistry;improved;in vivo;in vivo Model;insight;lung cancer screening;malignant breast neoplasm;outcome forecast;performance tests;prognostic;prognostic value;response;standard of care;tool;translational study;tumor;tumor metabolism;tumor progression,Peter Kuhn,Matthew R Young,404236,404236,2015-09-01T12:09:00Z,2013-09-20T12:09:00Z,2016-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-13-002,nofo_RFA-CA-13-002,university of southern california,Los Angeles,CA,UNITED STATES,imat,org_name,False

However, their widespread use is limited by a number of difficulties in manufacturing such cells. Current manufacturing processes are complicated, costly, and can only produce cells for small populations. Additionally, they have large production variations. As a result, different patients receive very different products or treatments. The long-term goal is to develop a novel technology to address the CAR T manufacturing challenge. Toward this goal, the team has developed a proof- of-concept technology termed stress-free intra-tubular cell culture technology (SFIT). SFIT provides cells uniform, highly reproducible, controllable, and cell-friendly microenvironments, resulting in extremely high culture efficiency and consistency. SFIT produces cells for each patient with one small conical tube, significantly reducing production cost and increasing production capability. The purpose of this project is to further develop and validate this technology and the associated methods to make it ready for the final translational challenge. Leveraging sound preliminary studies and a diverse team of experts, the specific aims are to (1) validate SFIT for culturing T cells from a wide range of donors and for culturing various T cell subtypes, (2) further develop and validate methods for transducing T cells with lentivirus and γ-retrovirus in SFIT, and (3) further develop and validate the SFIT-based single-conical-tube-device for producing autologous CAR T cells. The project will build on the team’s strong preliminary work and include mathematical modeling, prototype device design, extensive T cell culturing, exome-Seq and RNA-Seq data analyses, in vivo testing, statistical analyses and comparisons, and partnership with ADS BIOTEC, a company that designs, builds, and sells instruments for processing human cells. With the completion of this project, simple, disposable, affordable devices for the scalable, cost-effective and consistent production of autologous CAR T cells are expected. This technology can also be scaled up for producing allogeneic CAR T cells in large scales if needed. This technology will not only make CAR T cells broadly accessible, but also make the product much more consistent and predictable. Based on 2012-2014 data, approximately 38.5% of the human population will be diagnosed with some type of cancer during their lifetime. Currently, only about 67% of cancer patients will survive five years after diagnosis. CAR T cell therapy is expected to significantly increase their chances of survival. The technology developed in this proposal will make CAR T cells available to many patients.",3-Dimensional;Address;Adopted;Alginates;Allogenic;Autologous;B lymphoid malignancy;CAR T cell therapy;Caliber;Cancer Patient;Cell Aggregation;Cell Culture Techniques;Cell Death;Cells;Clinical Research;Cultured Cells;Data;Data Analyses;Development;Device Designs;Devices;Diagnosis;Diffusion;Disease;Dose;Ensure;Environmental Risk Factor;Gammaretrovirus;Genetic;Genetic Engineering;Geometry;Goals;Human;Hydrogels;Lentivirus;Malignant Neoplasms;Methods;Outcome;Patients;Population;Process;Production;Protocols documentation;Quality of life;Radial;Reproducibility;Solid Neoplasm;Statistical Data Interpretation;Stress;Suspension Culture;T-Lymphocyte;Technology;Time;Translations;Treatment Cost;Tube;Tubular formation;Variant;Virus;Work;base;cancer therapy;cancer type;cell growth;chimeric antigen receptor;chimeric antigen receptor T cells;clinically relevant;cost;cost effective;design;exome sequencing;improved;in vivo;in vivo evaluation;instrument;manufacturing process;mathematical model;new technology;novel;operation;preclinical study;prototype;scale up;shear stress;sound;success;therapy development;transcriptome sequencing;transduction efficiency;tumor,Yuguo Lei,Lokesh Agrawal,356057,356057,2021-04-22T12:04:00Z,2019-03-19T12:03:00Z,2023-02-28T12:02:00Z,RFA-CA-18-005,nofo_RFA-CA-18-005,"pennsylvania state university, the",UNIVERSITY PARK,PA,UNITED STATES,imat,org_name,False
7R33CA281875-02,R33CA281875,10909190,2023,"MASTER Scaffolds for Rapid, Single-Step Manufacture and Prototyping of CAR-T cells","PROJECT SUMMARY Despite the unprecedented clinical success of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy, its widespread application is limited by lengthy and labor-intensive ex vivo manufacturing procedures that result in: (i) high cost; (ii) delays to infuse CAR cells to patients with rapidly progressing disease; and (iii) CAR cells with heterogeneous composition and terminal differentiation, which limit their engraftment and persistence. There is a clear scientific and medical need for approaches to improve CAR T cell production, including methods to reduce cell processing times, reduce manufacturing costs, and reduce CAR cell differentiation. Recently, our labs collaboratively developed a new technology for CAR cell production called MASTER (Multifunctional Alginate Scaffolds for T cell Engineering and Release). MASTER consists of dry, macroporous alginate materials conjugated to αCD3 and αCD28 antibodies and encapsulating interleukin signaling. CAR generation with MASTER technology involves seeding freshly isolated, non-activated patient PBMCs together with CAR-encoding retroviral vectors and implanting scaffolds back into patients. Once implanted, MASTER mediates every step of the CAR production process, thereby eliminating the current standard procedural steps of αCD3/αCD28 pre-activation, viral transduction with spinoculation and interleukin-mediated CAR expansion. In vitro MASTER-generated CAR cells demonstrate reduced cellular differentiation as compared to CAR cells generated with gold-standard, “conventional” clinical protocols. In vivo MASTER-generated CAR cells demonstrate far superior in vivo cell persistence, enhanced anti-tumor efficacy and far superior prevention of tumor growth after rechallenge. The utility of this system is two-fold: 1) as a transformative therapeutic technology creating enhanced and affordable CAR therapy for cancer care and 2) as a research tool enabling rapid development, prototyping and testing of CAR therapeutic candidates. We have assembled a focused, multidisciplinary team comprised of an expert in biomaterials and drug delivery (Brudno), an expert in viral engineering and protein production (Birnbaum), two specialists in clinical CAR cell production (Chen, Roy) and a clinician focused on CAR cell therapies (Grover). In this proposal we seek to further develop and validate MASTER scaffolds and the associated methods to make them ready for widescale utilization by the research and clinical communities, including researchers in related areas eager to work in the CAR field but deterred by the barriers to test CAR construct in vivo. Leveraging transformative preliminary data that show that the shelf-stable MASTER scaffolds outperform conventional CAR cells in preclinical mouse models of lymphoma, orthotopic pancreatic cancer, and metastatic lung and ovarian tumors this proposal will validate MASTER scaffolds with a wide range of donors and at different scales, with multiple viral vectors and CAR constructs and delineate the phenotype and function resulting from MASTER production of CAR cells. The successful completion of these aims will propel our ultimate vision of low-cost and tunable generation of CAR cells for both liquid and solid tumors and potentially beyond the oncology space.",,Yevgeny Brudno,Ping Guan,261931,261931,2024-09-04T12:09:00Z,2023-08-17T12:08:00Z,2027-07-31T12:07:00Z,RFA-CA-22-004,nofo_RFA-CA-22-004,univ of north carolina chapel hill,CHAPEL HILL,NC,UNITED STATES,imat,org_name,False

By improving access to survivorship resources, health literacy, self-management skills and support, the intervention is designed to improve adherence to AYA healthcare guidelines and reduce cancer- related distress. The project leverages an existing survivorship informatics infrastructure, an established multicenter survivorship research network, and our experiences with a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with AYAs and a digital and telehealth program initially developed for hematopoietic cell transplant survivors. This research fills a critical gap in care for AYA survivors by providing a novel, personalized, technology-based self- management program with stepped care telehealth. To be scalable, it uses a risk-based delivery model targeted to AYA survivors with demonstrated need. The two-arm RCT will test the AYA-adapted INSPIRE digital program, including an interactive mobile app/website and social media, adding stepped care telehealth for those with continued distress, lack of survivorship healthcare literacy, or who are not using the digital program at 1 month. In the active control arm, survivors receive access to a study website with existing AYA survivor resource links followed by delayed access to the INSPIRE program. Specific aims are: 1) Among AYA survivors with elevated cancer-related distress, determine the efficacy of a self-management program, INSPIRE, delivered by interactive digital cross-device options and stepped care telehealth coaching, compared to the active control arm. 2) Among AYA survivors with inadequate adherence to healthcare guidelines, determine the efficacy of the INSPIRE digital and telehealth self-management program in improving overall healthcare adherence and cardiometabolic or subsequent malignancy surveillance compared to the active control arm. 3) Examine mechanisms associated with intervention efficacy including engagement with the online program, use of telehealth contacts, and improved health self-efficacy, health literacy, AYA-specific impact of cancer, and barriers to healthcare; and examine moderators of intervention engagement or response including cancer clinical factors, health status, and sociodemographic and environmental factors. 4) Define costs of maintaining and delivering components of the INSPIRE program if delivered in a scaled-up model of care. An exploratory aim will assess dissemination potential and define risk models associated with distress, poorer health status or healthcare nonadherence. Aims will be accomplished with a two-arm, multicenter, risk-stratified RCT of N=980 AYA survivors of leukemia, lymphoma, colorectal cancer, melanoma, or sarcoma, age 18-39, and 1-5 years post-diagnosis.

1U01CA246665-01,U01CA246665,9895223,2019,A Randomized Trial of a Mobile Health and Social Media Physical Activity Intervention Among Adolescent and Young Adult Childhood Cancer Survivors,"PROJECT SUMMARY Interventions to increase physical activity (PA) are vitally needed in adolescent and young adult childhood cancer survivors (AYA survivors) who are largely inactive but are at lifelong elevated risk of cardiomyopathy, insulin resistance, and other cardiometabolic disorders. To reach AYA survivors, their desire for peer connections, almost ubiquitous use of smartphones and social media, and strong preferences to exercise in their homes and communities and as part of social activity must be leveraged. The intervention must also be accessible and affordable for patients without private health insurance as they are less likely to receive survivorship care and more likely to have greater morbidity. The transdisciplinary study team has completed two recent pilot studies among AYA survivors that provide substantial scientific premise for the proposed research by demonstrating that the intervention is feasible, has high rates of uptake and adherence, and appears promising for increasing PA. The proposed multi-site, randomized controlled trial (RCT) will enroll 384 AYA survivors currently ages 15.0- 20.9 years who are 3-36 months off therapy and not meeting PA guidelines. The 12-month trial will test the efficacy of a 6-month intensive multi-level PA intervention combining a wearable Fitbit PA tracker (intrapersonal level) with integration of activity data leading to individualized goal setting by text (intrapersonal level) and a private Instagram account serving as a virtual peer support group of survivors (interpersonal and community level) followed by a 6-month maintenance phase to improve PA in AYA survivors. Given the ubiquity of PA tracking devices and apps, the control group will receive the Fitbit only without integration of Fitbit data in other activities. A nationwide sample of patients drawn from rural, urban, community, and academic centers will be recruited using the Children’s Oncology Group consortium of >200 hospitals. This rigorously designed, multi-site RCT will test the efficacy of the mobile health (mHealth) behavioral intervention, compared to the control group, to achieve the following Specific Aims among AYA survivors over 12 months: Aim 1 - To increase PA; Aim 2 - To improve biomarkers predictive of cardiometabolic health; and Aim 3 - To improve health-related quality of life. Analyses of hypothesized mediation factors for Aims 1-3 and post-trial qualitative interviews among participants with and without private health insurance will provide explanatory knowledge to help refine intervention procedures and tailor the intervention for future RCTs among patient subgroups who will most benefit. If shown to be efficacious, this mHealth intervention to improve PA in AYA survivors is highly scalable because smartphones and social media are widespread, PA trackers are popular and affordable, goal setting can be automated, and social media activities do not require specialized staff.",Accelerometer;Adherence;Adolescent and Young Adult;Aftercare;Age;Behavior Therapy;Biological Assay;Biological Markers;Blood;Cancer Burden;Cardiomyopathies;Cardiopulmonary;Caring;Cellular Phone;Chronic;Communities;Competence;Control Groups;Data;Devices;Disease;Dyslipidemias;Enrollment;Evaluation;Exercise;Fasting;Fatigue;Future;Goals;Guidelines;Health;Health Insurance;Health behavior;Health education;Heart Rate;Home environment;Hospitals;Inflammatory;Insulin Resistance;Insurance;Intervention;Interview;Knowledge;Lipids;Maintenance;Mediating;Mediation;Morbidity - disease rate;Obesity;Participant;Patient Self-Report;Patients;Pediatric Oncology Group;Phase;Physical Function;Physical activity;Physiological;Pilot Projects;Population;Privatization;Procedures;Quality of life;Randomized;Randomized Controlled Trials;Research;Rest;Risk;Rural;Sampling;Site;Social Functioning;Support Groups;Survivors;Text;Treatment Efficacy;adipokines;base;behavioral health intervention;cancer therapy;cardiometabolic risk;cardiometabolism;cardiovascular health;childhood cancer survivor;cost;design;disparity reduction;efficacy testing;exercise intervention;fitbit;fitness;glucose metabolism;health disparity;health related quality of life;heart rate monitor;improved;indexing;instrument;intervention participants;mHealth;medical specialties;patient subsets;peer;peer support;personalized approach;portability;predictive marker;preference;primary outcome;psychologic;randomized trial;recruit;secondary outcome;sedentary;social;social media;survivorship;tool;uptake;virtual,Nina S Kadan-Lottick; Jason A Mendoza,Susan Czajkowski,752695,752695,2019-09-18T12:09:00Z,2019-09-19T12:09:00Z,2024-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-19-033,nofo_RFA-CA-19-033,yale university,NEW HAVEN,CT,UNITED STATES,improving_outcomes_for_pediatric_adolescent_and_young_adult_cancer_survivors,org_name,False

The transdisciplinary study team has completed two recent pilot studies among AYA survivors that provide substantial scientific premise for the proposed research by demonstrating that the intervention is feasible, has high rates of uptake and adherence, and appears promising for increasing PA. The proposed multi-site, randomized controlled trial (RCT) will enroll 384 AYA survivors currently ages 15.0- 20.9 years who are 3-36 months off therapy and not meeting PA guidelines. The 12-month trial will test the efficacy of a 6-month intensive multi-level PA intervention combining a wearable Fitbit PA tracker (intrapersonal level) with integration of activity data leading to individualized goal setting by text (intrapersonal level) and a private Instagram account serving as a virtual peer support group of survivors (interpersonal and community level) followed by a 6-month maintenance phase to improve PA in AYA survivors. Given the ubiquity of PA tracking devices and apps, the control group will receive the Fitbit only without integration of Fitbit data in other activities. A nationwide sample of patients drawn from rural, urban, community, and academic centers will be recruited using the Children’s Oncology Group consortium of >200 hospitals. This rigorously designed, multi-site RCT will test the efficacy of the mobile health (mHealth) behavioral intervention, compared to the control group, to achieve the following Specific Aims among AYA survivors over 12 months: Aim 1 - To increase PA; Aim 2 - To improve biomarkers predictive of cardiometabolic health; and Aim 3 - To improve health-related quality of life. Analyses of hypothesized mediation factors for Aims 1-3 and post-trial qualitative interviews among participants with and without private health insurance will provide explanatory knowledge to help refine intervention procedures and tailor the intervention for future RCTs among patient subgroups who will most benefit.

By improving access to survivorship resources, health literacy, self-management skills and support, the intervention is designed to improve adherence to AYA healthcare guidelines and reduce cancer- related distress. The project leverages an existing survivorship informatics infrastructure, an established multicenter survivorship research network, and our experiences with a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with AYAs and a digital and telehealth program initially developed for hematopoietic cell transplant survivors. This research fills a critical gap in care for AYA survivors by providing a novel, personalized, technology-based self- management program with stepped care telehealth. To be scalable, it uses a risk-based delivery model targeted to AYA survivors with demonstrated need. The two-arm RCT will test the AYA-adapted INSPIRE digital program, including an interactive mobile app/website and social media, adding stepped care telehealth for those with continued distress, lack of survivorship healthcare literacy, or who are not using the digital program at 1 month. In the active control arm, survivors receive access to a study website with existing AYA survivor resource links followed by delayed access to the INSPIRE program. Specific aims are: 1) Among AYA survivors with elevated cancer-related distress, determine the efficacy of a self-management program, INSPIRE, delivered by interactive digital cross-device options and stepped care telehealth coaching, compared to the active control arm. 2) Among AYA survivors with inadequate adherence to healthcare guidelines, determine the efficacy of the INSPIRE digital and telehealth self-management program in improving overall healthcare adherence and cardiometabolic or subsequent malignancy surveillance compared to the active control arm. 3) Examine mechanisms associated with intervention efficacy including engagement with the online program, use of telehealth contacts, and improved health self-efficacy, health literacy, AYA-specific impact of cancer, and barriers to healthcare; and examine moderators of intervention engagement or response including cancer clinical factors, health status, and sociodemographic and environmental factors. 4) Define costs of maintaining and delivering components of the INSPIRE program if delivered in a scaled-up model of care. An exploratory aim will assess dissemination potential and define risk models associated with distress, poorer health status or healthcare nonadherence. Aims will be accomplished with a two-arm, multicenter, risk-stratified RCT of N=980 AYA survivors of leukemia, lymphoma, colorectal cancer, melanoma, or sarcoma, age 18-39, and 1-5 years post-diagnosis. The primary outcome is reduced distress at 3 months; secondary outcomes are improved adherence and reduced distress at 12 months. If effective, the program is positioned for accelerated dissemination/implementation to improve care for AYA survivors by using a scalable informatics-based administration and largely digital intervention program.",,Kevin S Baker,Lynn S Adams,530889,530889,2022-05-27T12:05:00Z,2020-09-18T12:09:00Z,2024-02-29T12:02:00Z,RFA-CA-19-033,nofo_RFA-CA-19-033,fred hutchinson cancer center,SEATTLE,WA,UNITED STATES,improving_outcomes_for_pediatric_adolescent_and_young_adult_cancer_survivors,org_name,False

Clinical studies show that autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) remains an efficacious consolidation treatment for eligible patients and a subset of transplant recipients achieve long-term control of disease. Currently, the prolongation of plateau-phase induced by ASCT is attributed to the use of myeloablative chemotherapy and cytoreduction. However, ASCT generates inflammation and profound lymphodepletion, whilst disrupting the marrow microenvironment, all of which has the potential to induce anti-myeloma immunity. We have recently utilized novel preclinical models to provide definitive evidence that ASCT invokes myeloma-specific T cell immunity and the re-establishment of a state of immune equilibrium. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that disease progression after ASCT in these systems is a result of CD8 T cell exhaustion that is dependent on the accumulation of myeloid suppressive populations and the expression of multiple checkpoint molecules by CD8 T cells. These inhibitory pathways are highly amenable to immunotherapeutic approaches after ASCT that invoke long term survival. This proposal will utilize sophisticated protein and transcriptional based approaches to examine the relationship of T cell function in the peri-transplant period to subsequent survival and disease control in well-annotated clinical cohorts.

1U01DE028233-01,U01DE028233,9625949,2018,Targeting the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment to enhance efficacy of radiotherapy and immuno-radiotherapy for oral cancer,"PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT: Radiation therapy (RT) is a mainstay of cancer treatment. However many tumors are resistant to RT, making it possible for microscopic tumor cells to remain or travel to other parts of the body and cause cancer recurrence at a later date. Immunotherapies can train the patient’s immune system to seek out and identify hidden tumor cells. The combination of RT with immunotherapy is a very exciting approach, but RT can have both immune- stimulating and immune suppressive effects, and further study is needed to understand how best to combine RT with immunotherapy. Many scientists now believe that understanding the tumor microenvironment – the types of cells which make up a tumor, and their interactions – is required to maximize the immune-stimulating effects of RT. We have discovered a strategy to alter the balance of cells in the tumor microenvironment of oral cancer and other solid tumor types, by simultaneously targeting immunosuppressive myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and regulatory T cells (Treg), so that immune-stimulating effects of RT predominate. Studies in mouse tumors show that this strategy is particularly effective when combined with an immunotherapy approach called “checkpoint inhibition” that targets molecules that limit effectiveness of anti- tumor T cells. This leads to our scientific hypothesis that tumor-infiltrating MDSC and Treg render the tumor microenvironment resistant to immune activation by RT and/or checkpoint inhibition, and limit the induction of tumor-specific CD8+ T cells and other immune effector immune cells. The goals of this proposal are to 1) determine whether modulating the tumor immune microenvironment enhances responsiveness of oral cancer to RT and/or checkpoint inhibition, leading to long-lasting and powerful anti-tumor effects; 2) determine the immunological mechanisms which make these combination therapies effective; and 3) develop a novel drug formulation which will make this approach more effective and suitable for testing in clinical trials. We will accomplish these goals by carrying out the following specific aims: In Aim 1 we will functionally dissect the immune mechanisms by which MDSC contribute to radioresistance in mouse oral cancer models. In Aim 2 we will assess the ability of dual targeting of MDSC and Treg to sensitize oral cancer to treatment with RT + anti-PD-1 and induce durable protective memory responses. In Aim 3 we will develop a novel drug delivery system that can enhance delivery of inhibitors of MDSC function directly to the tumor and tumor-infiltrating MDSC.",Acute;Adoptive Transfer;Adverse effects;Antitumor Response;Automobile Driving;Binding;Body part;CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes;CD8B1 gene;Cancer Etiology;Cancer Model;Cell physiology;Cells;Chronic;Clinical;Clinical Research;Clinical Trials;Clinical effectiveness;Combined Modality Therapy;Cyclophosphamide;Cytotoxic T-Lymphocytes;Data;Deglutition;Dose;Drug Delivery Systems;Drug Formulations;Effectiveness;Effector Cell;Equilibrium;Goals;Head and Neck Cancer;Human Papillomavirus;Immune;Immune checkpoint inhibitor;Immune response;Immune system;Immunologics;Immunosuppression;Immunosuppressive Agents;Immunotherapeutic agent;Immunotherapy;Impairment;Integrin alpha4beta1;Ligands;Mediating;Memory;Microscopic;Modeling;Mucositis;Mus;Myeloid Cells;Myeloid-derived suppressor cells;NOS2A gene;Nitric Oxide Synthetase Inhibitor;Oral Characters;Oral cavity;Oropharyngeal;PDCD1LG1 gene;Patient Education;Pharyngeal structure;Postoperative Period;Radiation;Radiation therapy;Radiation-Sensitizing Agents;Radioimmunotherapy;Radioresistance;Refractory;Regulatory T-Lymphocyte;Resistance;Role;SLEB2 gene;Scientist;Solid Neoplasm;Speech;System;T memory cell;T-Lymphocyte;Testing;Travel;Treatment Efficacy;Tumor Immunity;anti-PD1 therapy;anti-tumor immune response;antitumor effect;barrier to care;cancer recurrence;cancer therapy;cell type;checkpoint inhibition;chemoradiation;chemotherapy;design;efficacy testing;immune activation;immune checkpoint blockade;immune resistance;immunomodulatory drugs;immunoregulation;inhibitor/antagonist;malignant mouth neoplasm;malignant oropharynx neoplasm;mouse model;mouth squamous cell carcinoma;nanoparticle;nanoparticle delivery;neoplastic cell;novel;novel strategies;novel therapeutics;pre-clinical;radiation effect;radiation response;radioresistant;radiosensitizing;resistance gene;response;saliva secretion;small molecule;small molecule inhibitor;therapy resistant;tumor;tumor growth;tumor microenvironment;uptake,Ananth V Annapragada; Andrew Sikora,Jason Wan,804594,536395,2018-09-18T12:09:00Z,2018-09-19T12:09:00Z,2023-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-17-045,nofo_RFA-CA-17-045,baylor college of medicine,HOUSTON,TX,UNITED STATES,iotn,org_name,False

However many tumors are resistant to RT, making it possible for microscopic tumor cells to remain or travel to other parts of the body and cause cancer recurrence at a later date. Immunotherapies can train the patient’s immune system to seek out and identify hidden tumor cells. The combination of RT with immunotherapy is a very exciting approach, but RT can have both immune- stimulating and immune suppressive effects, and further study is needed to understand how best to combine RT with immunotherapy. Many scientists now believe that understanding the tumor microenvironment – the types of cells which make up a tumor, and their interactions – is required to maximize the immune-stimulating effects of RT. We have discovered a strategy to alter the balance of cells in the tumor microenvironment of oral cancer and other solid tumor types, by simultaneously targeting immunosuppressive myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and regulatory T cells (Treg), so that immune-stimulating effects of RT predominate. Studies in mouse tumors show that this strategy is particularly effective when combined with an immunotherapy approach called “checkpoint inhibition” that targets molecules that limit effectiveness of anti- tumor T cells. This leads to our scientific hypothesis that tumor-infiltrating MDSC and Treg render the tumor microenvironment resistant to immune activation by RT and/or checkpoint inhibition, and limit the induction of tumor-specific CD8+ T cells and other immune effector immune cells. The goals of this proposal are to 1) determine whether modulating the tumor immune microenvironment enhances responsiveness of oral cancer to RT and/or checkpoint inhibition, leading to long-lasting and powerful anti-tumor effects; 2) determine the immunological mechanisms which make these combination therapies effective; and 3) develop a novel drug formulation which will make this approach more effective and suitable for testing in clinical trials.

6U01CA244291-02,U01CA244291,10603047,2019,Optimizing myeloma-specific immunity after autologous stem cell transplantation,"Abstract Multiple myeloma is the second most common hematological malignancy and despite improved patient outcomes in the era of novel agents, it remains largely incurable. Clinical studies show that autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) remains an efficacious consolidation treatment for eligible patients and a subset of transplant recipients achieve long-term control of disease. Currently, the prolongation of plateau-phase induced by ASCT is attributed to the use of myeloablative chemotherapy and cytoreduction. However, ASCT generates inflammation and profound lymphodepletion, whilst disrupting the marrow microenvironment, all of which has the potential to induce anti-myeloma immunity. We have recently utilized novel preclinical models to provide definitive evidence that ASCT invokes myeloma-specific T cell immunity and the re-establishment of a state of immune equilibrium. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that disease progression after ASCT in these systems is a result of CD8 T cell exhaustion that is dependent on the accumulation of myeloid suppressive populations and the expression of multiple checkpoint molecules by CD8 T cells. These inhibitory pathways are highly amenable to immunotherapeutic approaches after ASCT that invoke long term survival. This proposal will utilize sophisticated protein and transcriptional based approaches to examine the relationship of T cell function in the peri-transplant period to subsequent survival and disease control in well-annotated clinical cohorts. A major focus will be the optimization of innovative immunotherapy approaches after ASCT in preclinical systems for clinical translation.",,Geoffrey Roger Hill,Min-Kyung H Song,2208097,2208097,2022-06-07T12:06:00Z,2019-09-25T12:09:00Z,2024-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-19-015,nofo_RFA-CA-19-015,fred hutchinson cancer center,SEATTLE,WA,UNITED STATES,iotn,org_name,False
1R21CA231904-01,R21CA231904,9604117,2018,An Ontology-driven Faceted Query Engine for the Kentucky Cancer Registry,"ABSTRACT A key barrier in cancer research is the traditional data access workflow that requires a hypothesis prior to accessing patient data, rather than a workflow that begins with data exploration while protecting privacy. Existing query engines allow researchers to explore clinical data, build queries, and execute queries without the need for the user to understand how the data is stored. However, the interfaces of such query engines have not achieved usability approaching the levels of those for consumer websites due in critical part to the lack of faceted capabilities. Faceted systems for querying clinical data is currently unavailable due to the complexity of data and the mismatch between the ontologies used for organizing and annotating clinical data (such as NCI Thesaurus), and the desired facet structures and properties. We propose to overcome these challenges by developing OncoSphere, a query engine using the NCI Thesaurus as a nested facet system (NFS) to provide web-based exploration of the Kentucky Cancer Registry data using 3 Specific Aims. In Aim 1 we will develop an approach to transform and implement NCI Thesaurus into an NFS to enable OncoSphere’s interface features. In Aim 2 we will develop methods to perform quality auditing on the hierarchical structure of the NCI Thesaurus to enhance its quality in supporting faceted query for OncoSphere. In Aim 3 we will perform evaluation on OncoSphere’s query expressiveness, query performance and conduct preliminary usability assessment. OncoSphere will break new ground in web-based tools and capitalize on available data resources to accelerate cancer research. We expect OncoSphere and its future versions to become an invaluable resource for the cancer research community. The long-term goal of this study is to create data exploration systems for NCI’s Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program and other related cancer data resources through data science innovations to transform user experience with a new generation of data interaction modalities.",Address;Adopted;Area;Biomedical Research;Characteristics;Clinical Data;Clinical Research;Clinical Trials;Communities;Computer software;Data;Data Science;Databases;Detection;Development;Ensure;Evaluation;Future;Generations;Goals;Kentucky;Knowledge;Lead;Malignant Neoplasms;Metadata;Methods;Modality;NCI Thesaurus;Online Systems;Ontology;Patients;Performance;Privacy;Property;Research Personnel;Resources;Role;SEER Program;Site;Software Tools;Structure;System;Terminology;Time;Translations;Trees;Work;anticancer research;data access;data integration;data management;data registry;data resource;design;experience;human data;improved;innovation;insight;lexical;neoplasm registry;neoplasm resource;novel;query optimization;sound;success;tool;usability;web app;web site;web-based tool,Licong Cui; Guo-Qiang Zhang,Donna Rivera,187621,187621,2018-06-06T12:06:00Z,2018-06-06T12:06:00Z,2019-02-03T12:02:00Z,PAR-15-334,nofo_PAR-15-334,university of kentucky,LEXINGTON,KY,UNITED STATES,itcr,org_name,False
1R21CA264383-01,R21CA264383,10305561,2021,Predicting transcriptional signatures and tumor subtypes from circulating tumor DNA,"Project Summary/Abstract Tumor phenotype changes, such as trans-differentiation in lethal prostate cancers and hormone receptor conversions in breast cancer, are increasingly frequent observations as resistance mechanisms to targeted therapies. Therefore, characterizing the transcriptional regulation that drives treatment-induced tumor phenotype changes during therapy in “real-time” has critical implications for studying mechanisms of resistance to therapies and informing clinical treatment decisions. Surveillance of molecular changes in tumors is especially challenging because the location and number of metastatic sites make it intractable to perform repeated biopsies. As a result, it is difficult to characterize tumor evolution and cellular plasticity during therapy, exemplifying a major limitation of current treatment strategies and precision medicine for patients with metastatic cancer. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) released from tumor cells into the blood is a non-invasive “liquid biopsy” solution for addressing challenges in tissue accessibility. Current research and clinical efforts have focused on detecting genomic alterations in ctDNA. However, studying the tumor phenotype from ctDNA remains challenging and is still a nascent area of research. The objective of this proposal is to develop an innovative computational method to profile and integrate genomic alterations, chromatin accessibility, and transcriptional regulation directly from standard ctDNA sequencing data. Recent advances and our preliminary studies now demonstrate the intriguing possibility to profile these “multi- omic” patterns solely from computational analysis of standard ctDNA whole genome sequencing data. However, there is still a lack of tools to predict transcriptional profiles from ctDNA. In Aim 1, we will develop a generalized framework to predict transcriptional regulation from ctDNA. We will optimize ctDNA data normalization and develop an unsupervised probabilistic generative model for predicting chromatin accessibility and transcriptional regulation in ctDNA. To evaluate the method, we will perform benchmarking using plasma ctDNA from patient- derived xenograft models. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that the multi-omic signatures profiled from ctDNA will provide a non-invasive approach to classify tumor subtypes and to survey molecular phenotype changes during therapy. We will develop classifiers for predicting tumor subtypes and phenotype changes in adult and pediatric cancers. To test the utility for characterizing multi-omic signature and predicting treatment-induced phenotype changes, we will analyze serial ctDNA samples from patients receiving targeted therapies. The method will be implemented as an open-source R package, and a workflow that can be deployed on local and cloud environments, facilitating its adoption in the cancer research community. This proposal addresses the urgent unmet clinical need for better analytical approaches to study cancer treatment resistance in “real-time” and to advance cancer precision medicine.",Address;Adenocarcinoma;Adoption;Adult;Advanced Malignant Neoplasm;Area;Benchmarking;Biological Assay;Biopsy;Blood;Breast;Cessation of life;Chromatin;Classification;Clinical;Clinical Data;Clinical Treatment;Collaborations;Communities;Computer Analysis;Computing Methodologies;DNA Sequence Alteration;DNA sequencing;Data;Detection;Disease;Disease Progression;Disseminated Malignant Neoplasm;Environment;Evolution;Gene Expression Profile;Gene Expression Profiling;Gene Expression Regulation;Genome;Genomics;Hormone Receptor;Life;Location;Malignant Childhood Neoplasm;Malignant Neoplasms;Malignant neoplasm of lung;Malignant neoplasm of prostate;Metastatic/Recurrent;Methods;Molecular;Mutation;Neuroendocrine Carcinoma;Nucleosomes;Oncogenes;Patients;Pattern;Performance;Phenotype;Plasma;Precision therapeutics;Primary Neoplasm;Prostate;Research;Resistance;Sampling;Site;Surveys;Testing;Time;Tissues;Transcriptional Regulation;Tumor Subtype;Tumor Tissue;anticancer research;base;cancer diagnosis;cancer therapy;cancer type;cell free DNA;clinical care;clinical diagnostics;computerized tools;genome sequencing;innovation;liquid biopsy;malignant breast neoplasm;molecular phenotype;molecular subtypes;multiple omics;neoplastic cell;novel therapeutics;open source;patient derived xenograft model;patient subsets;precision medicine;precision oncology;predictive modeling;resistance mechanism;standard of care;targeted treatment;therapy resistant;tool;transcriptome;transdifferentiation;treatment strategy;tumor;tumor DNA;whole genome,Gavin Ha,Miguel Ossandon,44945,44945,2021-09-10T12:09:00Z,2021-09-10T12:09:00Z,2022-03-31T12:03:00Z,RFA-CA-20-007,nofo_RFA-CA-20-007,fred hutchinson cancer research center,SEATTLE,WA,UNITED STATES,itcr,org_name,False
1U01CA220401-01A1,U01CA220401,9507539,2018,Informatics Tools for Quantitative Digital Pathology Profiling and Integrated Prognostic Modeling,"PROJECT SUMMARY Accurate biomarker-driven prognostic stratification, response prediction, and cohort enrichment are critical for realizing precision treatment strategies and population health management approaches that optimize quality of life and survival for cancer patients. Genomics holds promise for improving classification and prognostication of malignancies, yet oncology practice continues to rely heavily on immunohistochemistry (IHC) as a fundamental tool due to its practicality and ability to provide protein-level and subcellular localization information. The goal of this proposal is to create an open-source software resource for the quantitative analysis of IHC stained tissues and effective integration of IHC, genomic, and clinical features for cancer classification and prognostication. This proposal builds on our collective experience in computer-assisted analysis of microscopic images (including IHC images), development of machine-learning methods to address the challenges of classification and prognostication with heterogeneous and high-dimensional data, and leadership in collection and large-scale analysis of cancer outcomes involving collaboration with multiple medical centers. This effort for the first time will create tools to integrate quantitative IHC imaging, clinical, and genomic information that will in turn enable the research community to explore strategies for the classification of malignancies and prediction of outcomes. The proposed tools will be developed and extensively validated in close collaboration with clinical, genomic, and digital pathology data from the NCI-supported Lymphoma Epidemiology of Outcomes (LEO) cohort study. The software tools produced by this proposal will enable the characterization of subcellular protein expression in cell nuclei, membranes and cytoplasmic compartments. Spatial features of protein expression heterogeneity, along with patient-level summaries of protein expression will be used to develop machine-learning classifiers for cancer subtypes, using diffuse large b-cell lymphomas as a driving application. Technology for automatic tuning of machine learning algorithms will enable a broad class of clinically and biologically motivated users to utilize these tools in their investigations. We will also provide an interactive dashboard that enables users to integrate genomic and IHC-based features to explore prognostic models of patient survival. These tools will be released and documented under an open-source model, integrated with HistomicsTK (https://histomicstk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), and available to the broader cancer research community.",Academic Medical Centers;Address;Adopted;Algorithms;Automobile Driving;Behavior;Biological;Cancer Patient;Cancer Prognosis;Cations;Cell Nucleus;Classification;Clinic;Clinical;Clinical Trials;Cohort Studies;Collaborations;Collection;Color;Communities;Computer Assisted;Computer software;Data;Data Set;Decision Trees;Development;Diagnosis;Disease;ERBB2 gene;Enrollment;Epidemiology;Flowers;Genetic Markers;Genomics;Goals;Heterogeneity;Histology;Image;Image Analysis;Immunohistochemistry;Informatics;Institution;Investigation;Leadership;Learning;Letters;Lymphoma;Machine Learning;Malignant Neoplasms;Manuals;Measurement;Medical center;Membrane;Methods;Modeling;Newly Diagnosed;Non-Hodgkin&apos;s Lymphoma;Outcome;Pathologic;Pathologist;Patient-Focused Outcomes;Patients;Precision therapeutics;Prediction of Response to Therapy;Process;Proteins;Quality of life;Reproducibility;Research;Research Personnel;Resources;Science;Site;Software Tools;Stains;Standardization;Stratification;Technology;Testing;Time;Tissue Model;Tissue Stains;Tissues;Variant;Work;anticancer research;base;biomarker-driven;cancer classification;cancer diagnosis;cancer subtypes;cancer survival;clinical practice;clinical research site;cohort;dashboard;data management;design;digital;digital pathology;experience;follow-up;genomic biomarker;genomic data;health management;high dimensionality;improved;interactive tool;large cell Diffuse non-Hodgkin&apos;s lymphoma;learning strategy;malignant breast neoplasm;microscopic imaging;neoplasm resource;oncology;open source;operation;outcome prediction;pathology imaging;patient subsets;population health;predict clinical outcome;predicting response;predictive modeling;prognostic;prognostic value;protein expression;public health relevance;software development;tissue processing;tool;translational scientist;treatment strategy;tumor heterogeneity;whole slide imaging,Lee Cooper; Christopher R Flowers; Metin Nafi Gurcan,Rao L Divi,467872,467872,2018-06-12T12:06:00Z,2018-06-12T12:06:00Z,2021-05-31T12:05:00Z,PAR-15-332,nofo_PAR-15-332,emory university,ATLANTA,GA,UNITED STATES,itcr,org_name,True

We will leverage and extend an existing training platform and content we have developed. We will improve cancer informatics literacy and the usability of existing ITCR tools, support future ITCR tool developers, and teach informatics to a broad cross-section of interested parties. Our success will both deepen expertise within the field and broaden the exposure of ITCR tools within currently-unengaged research communities. Specifically, we will: (1) develop and release a software platform for rapidly prototyping, validating, and sharing modular training materials that can be delivered in a range of formats from massive online open courses, to in-person short courses, to in depth semester long courses, (2) develop informatics courses teaching not only specific use of ITCR tools to solve concrete scientific challenges but also broadly the concepts of informatics to a broad community ranging from citizen scientists to NCI funded PIs, (3) develop courses for ITCR tool developers around usability, documentation, support and marketing to improve the impact of these tools in the field, and (4) deliver in person and ""train the trainer"" courses that will scale the impact of our educational program both within NIH funded cancer centers and into currently underserved researchers at community colleges, minority serving institutions, historically black colleges and universities, and engaged citizens outside of academia. All software, content, and data developed by our program will be open source and made accessible to the broadest possible audience by leveraging our existing expertise in online and scalable in-person education, along with our relationships to MOOC providers, informatics platforms, and developers.

2U24CA180996-07,U24CA180996,9722332,2019,Cancer Genomics: Integrative and Salable Solutions in R/Bioconductor,"Abstract Bioconductor is an ecosystem of more than 1,500 open-source software and data packages for the statistical analysis and comprehension of high-throughput genomic data. It is widely used by the cancer genomics research community for statistical analysis and visualization. This software ecosystem is supported by core data classes and methods, reused by both users and developers, that provide convenient representations and efficient operations for many kinds of high-throughput molecular data. Falling sequencing costs and single-cell assays enable increasingly resolved study of the molecular biology of cancer, through combined assaying of DNA sequence, epigenetics, gene expression, protein, and other aspects, even at the single-cell level, for a single specimen. These developments present new challenges in complexity, size, and interpretability of the data. The overarching goal of this project is to create and adapt core Bioconductor software infrastructure to meet these challenges, through the following aims. First, we develop infrastructure for the analysis of single-cell multi-omic experiments. Second, we implement FAIR principles for improved somatic variant prioritization, by defining performant data architecture that harmonizes and integrates the large amount of experimental and annotation data available through Bioconductor. Users of our system will be able to create provenance-rich interoperable reports on structural and functional contexts of somatic variants for use in prioritization.

5R21CA264383-03,R21CA264383,10487475,2022,Predicting transcriptional signatures and tumor subtypes from circulating tumor DNA,"Project Summary/Abstract Tumor phenotype changes, such as trans-differentiation in lethal prostate cancers and hormone receptor conversions in breast cancer, are increasingly frequent observations as resistance mechanisms to targeted therapies. Therefore, characterizing the transcriptional regulation that drives treatment-induced tumor phenotype changes during therapy in “real-time” has critical implications for studying mechanisms of resistance to therapies and informing clinical treatment decisions. Surveillance of molecular changes in tumors is especially challenging because the location and number of metastatic sites make it intractable to perform repeated biopsies. As a result, it is difficult to characterize tumor evolution and cellular plasticity during therapy, exemplifying a major limitation of current treatment strategies and precision medicine for patients with metastatic cancer. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) released from tumor cells into the blood is a non-invasive “liquid biopsy” solution for addressing challenges in tissue accessibility. Current research and clinical efforts have focused on detecting genomic alterations in ctDNA. However, studying the tumor phenotype from ctDNA remains challenging and is still a nascent area of research. The objective of this proposal is to develop an innovative computational method to profile and integrate genomic alterations, chromatin accessibility, and transcriptional regulation directly from standard ctDNA sequencing data. Recent advances and our preliminary studies now demonstrate the intriguing possibility to profile these “multi- omic” patterns solely from computational analysis of standard ctDNA whole genome sequencing data. However, there is still a lack of tools to predict transcriptional profiles from ctDNA. In Aim 1, we will develop a generalized framework to predict transcriptional regulation from ctDNA. We will optimize ctDNA data normalization and develop an unsupervised probabilistic generative model for predicting chromatin accessibility and transcriptional regulation in ctDNA. To evaluate the method, we will perform benchmarking using plasma ctDNA from patient- derived xenograft models. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that the multi-omic signatures profiled from ctDNA will provide a non-invasive approach to classify tumor subtypes and to survey molecular phenotype changes during therapy. We will develop classifiers for predicting tumor subtypes and phenotype changes in adult and pediatric cancers. To test the utility for characterizing multi-omic signature and predicting treatment-induced phenotype changes, we will analyze serial ctDNA samples from patients receiving targeted therapies. The method will be implemented as an open-source R package, and a workflow that can be deployed on local and cloud environments, facilitating its adoption in the cancer research community.

5U01CA220401-04,U01CA220401,9929565,2021,Informatics Tools for Quantitative Digital Pathology Profiling and Integrated Prognostic Modeling,"PROJECT SUMMARY Accurate biomarker-driven prognostic stratification, response prediction, and cohort enrichment are critical for realizing precision treatment strategies and population health management approaches that optimize quality of life and survival for cancer patients. Genomics holds promise for improving classification and prognostication of malignancies, yet oncology practice continues to rely heavily on immunohistochemistry (IHC) as a fundamental tool due to its practicality and ability to provide protein-level and subcellular localization information. The goal of this proposal is to create an open-source software resource for the quantitative analysis of IHC stained tissues and effective integration of IHC, genomic, and clinical features for cancer classification and prognostication. This proposal builds on our collective experience in computer-assisted analysis of microscopic images (including IHC images), development of machine-learning methods to address the challenges of classification and prognostication with heterogeneous and high-dimensional data, and leadership in collection and large-scale analysis of cancer outcomes involving collaboration with multiple medical centers. This effort for the first time will create tools to integrate quantitative IHC imaging, clinical, and genomic information that will in turn enable the research community to explore strategies for the classification of malignancies and prediction of outcomes. The proposed tools will be developed and extensively validated in close collaboration with clinical, genomic, and digital pathology data from the NCI-supported Lymphoma Epidemiology of Outcomes (LEO) cohort study. The software tools produced by this proposal will enable the characterization of subcellular protein expression in cell nuclei, membranes and cytoplasmic compartments. Spatial features of protein expression heterogeneity, along with patient-level summaries of protein expression will be used to develop machine-learning classifiers for cancer subtypes, using diffuse large b-cell lymphomas as a driving application. Technology for automatic tuning of machine learning algorithms will enable a broad class of clinically and biologically motivated users to utilize these tools in their investigations. We will also provide an interactive dashboard that enables users to integrate genomic and IHC-based features to explore prognostic models of patient survival. These tools will be released and documented under an open-source model, integrated with HistomicsTK (https://histomicstk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), and available to the broader cancer research community.",Academic Medical Centers;Address;Adopted;Algorithmic Analysis;Algorithms;Automobile Driving;Behavior;Biological;Cancer Patient;Cancer Prognosis;Cell Nucleus;Classification;Clinic;Clinical;Clinical Trials;Cohort Studies;Collaborations;Collection;Color;Communities;Computer Assisted;Computer software;Data;Data Set;Decision Trees;Development;Diagnosis;Disease;ERBB2 gene;Enrollment;Epidemiology;Flowers;Genetic Markers;Genomics;Goals;Heterogeneity;Histology;Image;Image Analysis;Immunohistochemistry;Institution;Investigation;Leadership;Letters;Lymphoma;Machine Learning;Malignant Neoplasms;Manuals;Measurement;Medical center;Membrane;Methods;Modeling;Newly Diagnosed;Non-Hodgkin&apos;s Lymphoma;Oncology;Outcome;Pathologic;Pathologist;Patient-Focused Outcomes;Patients;Precision therapeutics;Prediction of Response to Therapy;Process;Proteins;Quality of life;Reproducibility;Research;Research Personnel;Resources;Science;Site;Software Tools;Stains;Standardization;Stratification;Technology;Testing;Time;Tissue Model;Tissue Stains;Tissues;Variant;Work;anticancer research;base;biomarker-driven;cancer classification;cancer diagnosis;cancer subtypes;cancer survival;clinical practice;clinical research site;cohort;dashboard;data management;design;digital;digital pathology;experience;follow-up;genomic biomarker;genomic data;health management;improved;informatics tool;interactive tool;large cell Diffuse non-Hodgkin&apos;s lymphoma;learning algorithm;learning classifier;machine learning algorithm;machine learning method;malignant breast neoplasm;microscopic imaging;multidimensional data;neoplasm resource;non-Hodgkin&apos;s lymphoma patients;open source;open source tool;operation;outcome prediction;pathology imaging;patient subsets;population health;predict clinical outcome;predicting response;predictive modeling;prognostic;prognostic model;prognostic value;protein expression;public health relevance;software development;tissue processing;tool;translational scientist;treatment strategy;tumor heterogeneity;whole slide imaging,Lee Cooper; Christopher R Flowers; Metin Nafi Gurcan,Rao L Divi,437968,437968,2021-06-04T12:06:00Z,2018-06-12T12:06:00Z,2023-05-31T12:05:00Z,PAR-15-332,nofo_PAR-15-332,northwestern university at chicago,CHICAGO,IL,UNITED STATES,itcr,org_name,False

7R21CA231904-02,R21CA231904,9949194,2019,An Ontology-driven Faceted Query Engine for the Kentucky Cancer Registry,"ABSTRACT A key barrier in cancer research is the traditional data access workflow that requires a hypothesis prior to accessing patient data, rather than a workflow that begins with data exploration while protecting privacy. Existing query engines allow researchers to explore clinical data, build queries, and execute queries without the need for the user to understand how the data is stored. However, the interfaces of such query engines have not achieved usability approaching the levels of those for consumer websites due in critical part to the lack of faceted capabilities. Faceted systems for querying clinical data is currently unavailable due to the complexity of data and the mismatch between the ontologies used for organizing and annotating clinical data (such as NCI Thesaurus), and the desired facet structures and properties. We propose to overcome these challenges by developing OncoSphere, a query engine using the NCI Thesaurus as a nested facet system (NFS) to provide web-based exploration of the Kentucky Cancer Registry data using 3 Specific Aims. In Aim 1 we will develop an approach to transform and implement NCI Thesaurus into an NFS to enable OncoSphere’s interface features. In Aim 2 we will develop methods to perform quality auditing on the hierarchical structure of the NCI Thesaurus to enhance its quality in supporting faceted query for OncoSphere. In Aim 3 we will perform evaluation on OncoSphere’s query expressiveness, query performance and conduct preliminary usability assessment. OncoSphere will break new ground in web-based tools and capitalize on available data resources to accelerate cancer research. We expect OncoSphere and its future versions to become an invaluable resource for the cancer research community. The long-term goal of this study is to create data exploration systems for NCI’s Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program and other related cancer data resources through data science innovations to transform user experience with a new generation of data interaction modalities.",Address;Adopted;Area;Biomedical Research;Characteristics;Clinical Data;Clinical Research;Clinical Trials;Communities;Computer software;Data;Data Science;Databases;Detection;Development;Ensure;Evaluation;Future;Generations;Goals;Kentucky;Knowledge;Lead;Malignant Neoplasms;Metadata;Methods;Modality;NCI Thesaurus;Online Systems;Ontology;Patients;Performance;Privacy;Property;Research Personnel;Resources;Role;SEER Program;Site;Software Tools;Structure;System;Terminology;Time;Translations;Trees;Work;anticancer research;data access;data integration;data management;data registry;data resource;design;experience;human data;improved;innovation;insight;lexical;neoplasm registry;neoplasm resource;novel;query optimization;sound;success;tool;usability;web app;web site;web-based tool,Licong Cui; Guo-Qiang Zhang,Angela B Mariotto,162452,162452,2019-07-04T12:07:00Z,2018-06-06T12:06:00Z,2021-07-31T12:07:00Z,PAR-15-334,nofo_PAR-15-334,university of texas hlth sci ctr houston,HOUSTON,TX,UNITED STATES,itcr,org_name,False
7U01CA220401-03,U01CA220401,10070213,2019,Informatics Tools for Quantitative Digital Pathology Profiling and Integrated Prognostic Modeling,"PROJECT SUMMARY Accurate biomarker-driven prognostic stratification, response prediction, and cohort enrichment are critical for realizing precision treatment strategies and population health management approaches that optimize quality of life and survival for cancer patients. Genomics holds promise for improving classification and prognostication of malignancies, yet oncology practice continues to rely heavily on immunohistochemistry (IHC) as a fundamental tool due to its practicality and ability to provide protein-level and subcellular localization information. The goal of this proposal is to create an open-source software resource for the quantitative analysis of IHC stained tissues and effective integration of IHC, genomic, and clinical features for cancer classification and prognostication. This proposal builds on our collective experience in computer-assisted analysis of microscopic images (including IHC images), development of machine-learning methods to address the challenges of classification and prognostication with heterogeneous and high-dimensional data, and leadership in collection and large-scale analysis of cancer outcomes involving collaboration with multiple medical centers. This effort for the first time will create tools to integrate quantitative IHC imaging, clinical, and genomic information that will in turn enable the research community to explore strategies for the classification of malignancies and prediction of outcomes. The proposed tools will be developed and extensively validated in close collaboration with clinical, genomic, and digital pathology data from the NCI-supported Lymphoma Epidemiology of Outcomes (LEO) cohort study. The software tools produced by this proposal will enable the characterization of subcellular protein expression in cell nuclei, membranes and cytoplasmic compartments. Spatial features of protein expression heterogeneity, along with patient-level summaries of protein expression will be used to develop machine-learning classifiers for cancer subtypes, using diffuse large b-cell lymphomas as a driving application. Technology for automatic tuning of machine learning algorithms will enable a broad class of clinically and biologically motivated users to utilize these tools in their investigations. We will also provide an interactive dashboard that enables users to integrate genomic and IHC-based features to explore prognostic models of patient survival. These tools will be released and documented under an open-source model, integrated with HistomicsTK (https://histomicstk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), and available to the broader cancer research community.",,Lee Cooper; Christopher R Flowers; Metin Nafi Gurcan,Rao L Divi,425457,425457,2020-05-28T12:05:00Z,2018-06-12T12:06:00Z,2022-05-31T12:05:00Z,PAR-15-332,nofo_PAR-15-332,northwestern university at chicago,CHICAGO,IL,UNITED STATES,itcr,org_name,False

However, targeted drugs have failed to produce durable clinical responses when used as single agents in glioblastoma (GBM), the most common and deadly primary brain tumor. Genetically engineered mouse (GEM) models are essential for functional validation of such mutations, but technical limitations have prevented their widespread use in preclinical cancer drug development. The Miller Lab has developed non- germline GEM (nGEM) models. The Berens Lab has performed comprehensive genomic and chemovulnerability profiling in a genetically diverse and faithful panel of patient-derived human xenograft (PDX) models. The Johnson Lab has developed a novel chemical proteomics method, multiplex inhibitor beads coupled with mass spectrometry (MIB-MS), to assess the activation state of the cellular kinome en masse and has shown that dynamic kinome reprogramming contributes to targeted drug resistance. In this Multi-PI project, we will combine our expertise to address the following Aims: (1) To credential PDX models against human GBM by kinome proteomics; (2) To develop genetically-matched nGEM models from distinct cells of origin; and (3) To credential PDX and nGEM models by dynamic kinome profiling. We will develop a genetically diverse panel of nGEM models with defined driver mutations and cellular origins that will be useful adjunct to PDX for preclinical drug development. We will then credential both PDX and nGEM models against resected GBM specimens using cross-species genome, transcriptome, and kinome, and drug response profiling. Models will be genomically matched to their human counterparts and used to develop rational combination therapies that combat single agent resistance mechanisms in genomically- defined tumor subtypes.

1R01CA222148-01A1,R01CA222148,9740709,2019,Conditionally Reprogrammed Cell Model for Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC),"Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most frequently diagnosed cancer (180,890 new cases in 2016) in men in the USA. Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is an effective first line therapy for locally advanced or metastatic disease. Unfortunately, once PCa recurs, the eventual development of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) remains an incurable disease and more effective therapies are needed. Currently, a limited number of cancer cell lines (LnCAP, PC3, DU-145, etc.) are available for research and many genetic mutations present in prostate cancer (e.g., SPOP mutation, FOXA1 mutation, TMPRSS2-ERG fusion, CHD1 loss) are not represented in such cells. New patient-derived cancer models are needed. However, patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models are successful at less than 2-5% efficiency with aggressive, high-grade metastatic tumors and organoid cultures only have an efficiency of 20%. However, our preliminary data demonstrate that conditional reprogramming (CR) has nearly a 100% success rate for establishing long-term cultures from either surgical prostate specimens or CT-guided biopsies. In this application, we propose the following specific aims to validate the potential of CR for translational use in human CRPC. We will first establish CR cultures from biopsies of 30 patients with CRPC and will characterize these culture genetically and phenotypically. Second, we compare the patients' drug response to those of corresponding tumor CR cells and their derivative CR- derived xenografts (CDXs). Lastly, we will use CR cultures in an unbiased high-throughput screen to identify new potential therapies for CRPC in collaboration with Dr. Craig Thomas at National Center for Advanced Translational Sciences (NCATS).

1R01CA248280-01,R01CA248280,9946259,2020,Rapid ex vivo biosensor cultures to assess dependencies in gastroesophageal cancer,"The ability to predict dependencies given the molecular features of a patient’s tumor is central to cancer precision medicine. The systematic use of CRISPR/Cas9 and pharmacologic tools in established cancer models is showing great potential to discover new targets. However, existing model development approaches require long periods of culture time during which evolutionary pressures reduce heterogeneity. And, it remains challenging to create long-term models for certain tumor types and genotypes, making it challenging to use perturbational tools to experimentally map dependencies. To address these challenges, our overarching goal is to develop ‘rapid ex vivo tumor biosensors’ whereby we would be able to interrogate cancer dependencies in an immediate short-term ‘culture’ of cancer cells taken from a patient biopsy/surgery/fluid collection as a novel research-grade experimental model of cancer. In doing so, we aim to couple the timing of drug or CRISPR/Cas9 perturbation with the preservation of subcellular heterogeneity. If successful, we hypothesize that this modelling approach will more accurately recapitulate patient tumors and may ultimately serve as a stronger foundation for preclinical therapeutic studies. This work should also substantially expand the fraction of patient samples that can be interrogated. Here, we propose using gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma (GEA) as a test case for this strategy due to our experience as well as the existence of marked intra-tumor heterogeneity. However, once established, this novel modeling platform should enable a wide range of basic and translational questions (both for GEA and other tumors) that require model formats that include heterogeneous cell populations. Our goal will be achieved via two Specific Aims including (1) using patient-derived organoids created on rapid time frames for CRISPR/Cas9 editing to validate emerging GEA dependencies; and (2) developing the ability to directly visualize and perturb single cells from matching patient ascites fluid or disaggregated primary tumors ex vivo using label-free imaging methods. We will benchmark these approaches against each other using the same clinically annotated, serially collected patient samples. In following the instructions for this RFP, we focus on technology-development focused goals as opposed to deeper mechanistic studies. We focus on benchmarking predictions and assessing reproducibility, sensitivity and specificity. This work is innovative, in that it brings together expertise at the intersection of functional genomics, advanced computational approaches for image-analysis and GEA genomics. If successful, this effort could have significant impact by establishing a foundation to expand this approach to other disease (tumor and non-cancer) indications.",Address;Ascites;Benchmarking;Biopsy;Biopsy Specimen;Biosensor;CRISPR/Cas technology;Cancer Model;Cell Line;Cell Survival;Cells;Clinical;Collection;Data;Data Collection;Dependence;Derivation procedure;Development;Disease;Drug Exposure;Esophagus;Experimental Models;Foundations;Future;Genomics;Genotype;Goals;Heterogeneity;Image;Instruction;Label;Liquid substance;Malignant Neoplasms;Maps;Methods;Microscopy;Mission;Modeling;Molecular;Monitor;Morbidity - disease rate;Operative Surgical Procedures;Organoids;Outcome Study;Paracrine Communication;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacology;Physiological;Population;Primary Neoplasm;Public Health;Reagent;Reproducibility;Research;Research Personnel;Research Support;Resolution;Sampling;Sensitivity and Specificity;Stomach Neoplasms;Survival Rate;Testing;Therapeutic;Therapeutic Studies;Time;TimeLine;Tissues;Work;base;cancer cell;cell type;cohort;experience;functional genomics;gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma;gastroesophageal cancer;imaging approach;imaging modality;improved;innovation;light microscopy;microscopic imaging;model development;mortality;novel;novel strategies;patient response;pre-clinical;precision medicine;precision oncology;preservation;pressure;response;single-cell RNA sequencing;success;technology development;tool;translational cancer research;tumor;tumor heterogeneity,Jesse Samuel Boehm,Joanna M.

5R01CA222148-05,R01CA222148,10478023,2022,Conditionally Reprogrammed Cell Model for Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC),"Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most frequently diagnosed cancer (180,890 new cases in 2016) in men in the USA. Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is an effective first line therapy for locally advanced or metastatic disease. Unfortunately, once PCa recurs, the eventual development of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) remains an incurable disease and more effective therapies are needed. Currently, a limited number of cancer cell lines (LnCAP, PC3, DU-145, etc.) are available for research and many genetic mutations present in prostate cancer (e.g., SPOP mutation, FOXA1 mutation, TMPRSS2-ERG fusion, CHD1 loss) are not represented in such cells. New patient-derived cancer models are needed. However, patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models are successful at less than 2-5% efficiency with aggressive, high-grade metastatic tumors and organoid cultures only have an efficiency of 20%. However, our preliminary data demonstrate that conditional reprogramming (CR) has nearly a 100% success rate for establishing long-term cultures from either surgical prostate specimens or CT-guided biopsies. In this application, we propose the following specific aims to validate the potential of CR for translational use in human CRPC. We will first establish CR cultures from biopsies of 30 patients with CRPC and will characterize these culture genetically and phenotypically. Second, we compare the patients' drug response to those of corresponding tumor CR cells and their derivative CR- derived xenografts (CDXs). Lastly, we will use CR cultures in an unbiased high-throughput screen to identify new potential therapies for CRPC in collaboration with Dr. Craig Thomas at National Center for Advanced Translational Sciences (NCATS).

The systematic use of CRISPR/Cas9 and pharmacologic tools in established cancer models is showing great potential to discover new targets. However, existing model development approaches require long periods of culture time during which evolutionary pressures reduce heterogeneity. And, it remains challenging to create long-term models for certain tumor types and genotypes, making it challenging to use perturbational tools to experimentally map dependencies. To address these challenges, our overarching goal is to develop ‘rapid ex vivo tumor biosensors’ whereby we would be able to interrogate cancer dependencies in an immediate short-term ‘culture’ of cancer cells taken from a patient biopsy/surgery/fluid collection as a novel research-grade experimental model of cancer. In doing so, we aim to couple the timing of drug or CRISPR/Cas9 perturbation with the preservation of subcellular heterogeneity. If successful, we hypothesize that this modelling approach will more accurately recapitulate patient tumors and may ultimately serve as a stronger foundation for preclinical therapeutic studies. This work should also substantially expand the fraction of patient samples that can be interrogated. Here, we propose using gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma (GEA) as a test case for this strategy due to our experience as well as the existence of marked intra-tumor heterogeneity. However, once established, this novel modeling platform should enable a wide range of basic and translational questions (both for GEA and other tumors) that require model formats that include heterogeneous cell populations. Our goal will be achieved via two Specific Aims including (1) using patient-derived organoids created on rapid time frames for CRISPR/Cas9 editing to validate emerging GEA dependencies; and (2) developing the ability to directly visualize and perturb single cells from matching patient ascites fluid or disaggregated primary tumors ex vivo using label-free imaging methods.

7R01CA204136-04,R01CA204136,9986359,2019,Credentialing murine models for glioblastoma preclinical drug development,"ABSTRACT Precision medicine promises to revolutionize oncology by targeting drugs to specific mutations. However, targeted drugs have failed to produce durable clinical responses when used as single agents in glioblastoma (GBM), the most common and deadly primary brain tumor. Genetically engineered mouse (GEM) models are essential for functional validation of such mutations, but technical limitations have prevented their widespread use in preclinical cancer drug development. The Miller Lab has developed non- germline GEM (nGEM) models. The Berens Lab has performed comprehensive genomic and chemovulnerability profiling in a genetically diverse and faithful panel of patient-derived human xenograft (PDX) models. The Johnson Lab has developed a novel chemical proteomics method, multiplex inhibitor beads coupled with mass spectrometry (MIB-MS), to assess the activation state of the cellular kinome en masse and has shown that dynamic kinome reprogramming contributes to targeted drug resistance. In this Multi-PI project, we will combine our expertise to address the following Aims: (1) To credential PDX models against human GBM by kinome proteomics; (2) To develop genetically-matched nGEM models from distinct cells of origin; and (3) To credential PDX and nGEM models by dynamic kinome profiling. We will develop a genetically diverse panel of nGEM models with defined driver mutations and cellular origins that will be useful adjunct to PDX for preclinical drug development. We will then credential both PDX and nGEM models against resected GBM specimens using cross-species genome, transcriptome, and kinome, and drug response profiling. Models will be genomically matched to their human counterparts and used to develop rational combination therapies that combat single agent resistance mechanisms in genomically- defined tumor subtypes. This work will therefore help realize the promise of precision medicine in neuro- oncology.",ATRX gene;Address;Allografting;Antibodies;Antineoplastic Agents;BRAF gene;Behavior;Biological;CDKN2A gene;Cancer Biology;Cell Culture Techniques;Cell physiology;Cells;Chemicals;Clinical;Clinical Trials;Combined Modality Therapy;Coupled;Credentialing;Cultured Cells;Disease;Drug Combinations;Drug Modulation;Drug Screening;Drug Targeting;Drug resistance;ERBB2 gene;Environment;Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor;Fatal Outcome;Genes;Genetic;Genetically Engineered Mouse;Genome;Genomics;Glioblastoma;Goals;Growth;Heterogeneity;Human;Immunoassay;MAP Kinase Gene;Malignant Neoplasms;Malignant neoplasm of brain;Mass Spectrum Analysis;Mediating;Methods;Modeling;Molecular;Monitor;Mus;Mutate;Mutation;NF1 gene;Normal Cell;Operative Surgical Procedures;PIK3CG gene;PTEN gene;Pathogenesis;Pathologic;Pathway interactions;Patients;Penetrance;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacodynamics;Phosphotransferases;Preclinical Drug Development;Primary Brain Neoplasms;Proteomics;Reagent;Recurrence;Research Personnel;Resected;Resistance;Signal Transduction;Specimen;TP53 gene;Techniques;Testing;Transplantation;Tumor Subtype;Validation;Work;Xenograft Model;Xenograft procedure;actionable mutation;astrocyte progenitor;base;bcr-abl Fusion Proteins;brain cell;cell type;clinically relevant;combat;dark matter;disorder subtype;drug development;drug discovery;effective therapy;exome sequencing;feasibility trial;human disease;human model;in vitro Model;in vivo;individualized medicine;inhibitor/antagonist;kinase inhibitor;leukemia;malignant breast neoplasm;melanoma;mouse model;nerve stem cell;neuro-oncology;novel;oligodendrocyte progenitor;oncology;pre-clinical;precision medicine;prevent;prospective;public health relevance;resistance mechanism;response;targeted treatment;three dimensional cell culture;transcriptome;transcriptome sequencing;tumor,Michael E.

In our 15-year Partnership, we have accomplished many goals; for example, NMSU now has a strong cancer research infrastructure and Fred Hutch is increasing its attention to health disparities research. Our overall goals for this U54 cycle are to increase and maintain our excellence in the cancer research portfolio, cancer education, and outreach and dissemination; further, we will expand our efforts to develop leaders in cancer research and cancer health disparities research. Five specific aims will help us achieve our overall goals to: (1) Continue to develop a diverse portfolio of robust cancer research projects that span clinical, basic, and population health sciences; (2) Collaborate with regional community organizations that work with underrepresented populations to reduce cancer health disparities; (3) Maintain, strengthen, and evaluate our effective research education programs for current and future underrepresented scientists; (4) Continue to implement evidence-based relevant cancer-related public health interventions within underrepresented communities; and (5) Expand the scientific collaboration among U54 Partnership members and other faculty within the two institutions. To achieve these aims, we have assembled a broad portfolio of innovative cancer research projects (two full research projects and two pilot research projects) that each address an unmet regional need among underrepresented populations. Recent emphasis on health disparities represents a shift in the focus of our Partnership from basic to public health science research projects. These projects benefit from strong community input. In addition to the four research projects, we propose five cores: Administrative, Planning and Evaluation, Research Education About Cancer and Health (REACH), Outreach and Sustain Competitive Cancer Early Stage Scientists (SuCCESS) Cores that promote the development of cancer research, education, community collaboration, in-reach, and outreach.

Over the past twenty years, NMSU has increased its commitment to cancer research, and Fred Hutch has expanded its efforts in cancer prevention, education, and health disparities. The Partnership has expanded and adapted opportunities for research, education, training, and community engagement for historically excluded communities (HECs) in the U.S. Southwest and Pacific Northwest, responding to its mission of improving cancer health equity. Population health sciences and transdisciplinary studies are the focus of joint Research Projects to a greater extent than in previous cycles. Expansion of the research education portfolio parallels an increased breadth of cancer and health disparities Research Projects. Lastly, the Partnership has amplified the voices of the communities it serves through community engaged research practices. The Partnership’s goals for the next U54 cycle are to further increase excellence in cancer research, cancer education, and outreach and dissemination portfolios while working towards accomplishing larger transformational changes within the Partnership. This competing renewal application formulates and implements three Guiding Principles for the Partnership: Restructuring Scientific Environments, Restructuring Scientific Processes, and Restructuring Scientific Engagement. These principles bring new opportunities to strengthen equity, inclusion, and diversity across all activities proposed by this U54 Partnership in support of the following three Specific Aims (1) Continue to develop a diverse portfolio of robust cancer Research Projects that span clinical, basic and population health sciences (2) Implement, evaluate, and improve our research education programs for current and future scientists from historically excluded communities (HECs) (3) Collaborate with community organizations on outreach programs in New Mexico and Washington State that work with underrepresented populations to reduce health disparities. To achieve these aims, the Partnership has assembled innovative cancer Research Projects that address an unmet regional needs and benefit from strong community input. Each Core - Administrative, Planning and Evaluation, Research Education About Cancer and Health (REACH), Outreach and Resource for AcademIc SuccEss (RAISE) - has also proposed activities to implement the Guiding Principles. The Partnership formulated activities that are highly integrated across Research Projects and Cores to provide the necessary resources to participants while advancing progress to meeting the Partnership’s mission.","Address;Adopted;Advanced Malignant Neoplasm;Basic Science;Cancer Center;Cancer Research Project;Cancer health equity;Clinical;Collaborations;Communities;Comprehensive Cancer Center;Dedications;Education;Education and Outreach;Environment;Equity;Evaluation;Exclusion;Faculty;Funding;Future;Goals;Graduate Degree;Health;Health Disparities Research;Health Sciences;Health education;Individual;Institution;Internships;Joints;Knowledge;Laboratories;Malignant Neoplasms;Mentors;Mission;New Mexico;Pacific Northwest;Participant;Population Sciences;Process;Public Health;Publications;Recording of previous events;Reduce health disparities;Research;Research Personnel;Research Project Grants;Research Support;Resource Sharing;Resources;Science;Scientist;Southwestern United States;Students;Time;Training;Underrepresented Populations;Underrepresented Students;Underserved Population;Universities;Voice;Washington;Work;anticancer research;cancer education;cancer health disparity;cancer prevention;career;college;community engaged research;community engagement;community organizations;design;education research;equity, diversity, and inclusion;experience;health disparity;health disparity populations;improved;innovation;meetings;member;outreach;outreach program;population health;programs;recruit;success;undergraduate student;university student",Jaimee Heffner; Merranda Marin; Julian A Simon; Graciela Alexandra Unguez,Laritza Maria Rodriguez,1410939,1410939,2023-09-19T12:09:00Z,2007-09-30T12:09:00Z,2028-08-31T12:08:00Z,PAR-22-249,nofo_PAR-22-249,fred hutchinson cancer center,SEATTLE,WA,UNITED STATES,pache,org_name,False

Over the past twenty years, NMSU has increased its commitment to cancer research, and Fred Hutch has expanded its efforts in cancer prevention, education, and health disparities. The Partnership has expanded and adapted opportunities for research, education, training, and community engagement for historically excluded communities (HECs) in the U.S. Southwest and Pacific Northwest, responding to its mission of improving cancer health equity. Population health sciences and transdisciplinary studies are the focus of joint Research Projects to a greater extent than in previous cycles. Expansion of the research education portfolio parallels an increased breadth of cancer and health disparities Research Projects. Lastly, the Partnership has amplified the voices of the communities it serves through community engaged research practices. The Partnership’s goals for the next U54 cycle are to further increase excellence in cancer research, cancer education, and outreach and dissemination portfolios while working towards accomplishing larger transformational changes within the Partnership. This competing renewal application formulates and implements three Guiding Principles for the Partnership: Restructuring Scientific Environments, Restructuring Scientific Processes, and Restructuring Scientific Engagement. These principles bring new opportunities to strengthen equity, inclusion, and diversity across all activities proposed by this U54 Partnership in support of the following three Specific Aims (1) Continue to develop a diverse portfolio of robust cancer Research Projects that span clinical, basic and population health sciences (2) Implement, evaluate, and improve our research education programs for current and future scientists from historically excluded communities (HECs) (3) Collaborate with community organizations on outreach programs in New Mexico and Washington State that work with underrepresented populations to reduce health disparities. To achieve these aims, the Partnership has assembled innovative cancer Research Projects that address an unmet regional needs and benefit from strong community input. Each Core - Administrative, Planning and Evaluation, Research Education About Cancer and Health (REACH), Outreach and Resource for AcademIc SuccEss (RAISE) - has also proposed activities to implement the Guiding Principles.

Recent progress has identified essential barriers in this complex microenvironment that impede drug delivery and suppress immunity. These processes include the prohibitive interstitial pressures generated by high concentrations of hyaluronan (HA) complexed with water, dense fibrosis associated with fibrillar collagen deposition, and multiple classes of immunosuppressive and pro-tumorigenic cells such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells and macrophages. The team assembled in this project has made many of the seminal discoveries described above. In addition, we have developed several highly novel and powerful experimental platforms to rigorously interrogate the complex mechanisms and interactions among various compartments in the tumor microenvironment that collectively conspire to promote the survival of pancreas cancers and metastases and thwart treatment. Our overarching hypothesis is that significantly improving survival for PDA patients will require targeting not only the tumor epithelial cell, but also the three compartments that support its oncogenesis: hematopoietic, mesenchymal and extracellular matrix. In the following, we propose to investigate the combination of cytotoxic therapy with stromal disruption and myeloid cell modulations to maximize engagement of anti-tumor immunity and treatment efficacy. We will pursue these investigations in four distinct experimental platforms that offer complementary strengths and mitigate limitations: 1) genetically engineered mouse models (GEMM) of autochthonous PDA; 2) syngeneic allografts; 3) patient-derived xenograft (PDX) systems; and 4) patient-derived organoids (PDO).",Allografting;Alpha Cell;Architecture;Autologous;Behavior;Biological Models;Biology;Blood Vessels;Cancer Etiology;Cell Therapy;Cells;Cessation of life;Characteristics;Clinic;Coculture Techniques;Collagen;Complement;Complex;Cytotoxic Chemotherapy;Deposition;Disease;Disease Progression;Drug Delivery Systems;Education;Elements;Epithelial Cells;Evolution;Experimental Models;Extracellular Matrix;Extracellular Matrix Proteins;Fibrillar Collagen;Fibroblasts;Fibrosis;Friends;Functional disorder;Gel;Genetically Engineered Mouse;Glycosaminoglycans;Hematopoietic;Human;Hyaluronan;Immune;Immune response;Immunity;Immunosuppression;Immunosuppressive Agents;Investigation;Liquid substance;Malignant neoplasm of pancreas;Mechanics;Mesenchymal;Minority;Modeling;Mus;Myelogenous;Myeloid Cells;Myofibroblast;Neoplasm Metastasis;Normal tissue morphology;Organ;Organoids;Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma;Pathogenesis;Patients;Perfusion;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phase;Physiologic pulse;Physiology;Population;Process;Proteoglycan;Regimen;Research Personnel;Seminal;Series;Signal Transduction;Suppressor-Effector T-Lymphocytes;Surface;System;T-Lymphocyte;Toxic effect;Treatment Efficacy;Treatment Protocols;Tumor Immunity;Tumorigenicity;Water;Xenograft procedure;cell type;combinatorial;cytotoxic;hypoperfusion;improved;insight;interstitial;macrophage;monocyte;mouse model;next generation;novel;novel therapeutics;pressure;receptor;reconstitution;response;standard of care;therapy resistant;treatment strategy;tumor;tumor growth;tumor microenvironment;tumorigenesis;tumorigenic,Sunil R Hingorani,Jeffrey Hildesheim,1846829,1846829,2017-09-25T12:09:00Z,2017-09-30T12:09:00Z,2020-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-17-015,nofo_RFA-CA-17-015,fred hutchinson cancer research center,SEATTLE,WA,UNITED STATES,pacmen,org_name,False

Recent progress has identified essential barriers in this complex microenvironment that impede drug delivery and suppress immunity. These processes include the prohibitive interstitial pressures generated by high concentrations of hyaluronan (HA) complexed with water, dense fibrosis associated with fibrillar collagen deposition, and multiple classes of immunosuppressive and pro-tumorigenic cells such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells and macrophages. The team assembled in this project has made many of the seminal discoveries described above. In addition, we have developed several highly novel and powerful experimental platforms to rigorously interrogate the complex mechanisms and interactions among various compartments in the tumor microenvironment that collectively conspire to promote the survival of pancreas cancers and metastases and thwart treatment.

1U01CA199221-01,U01CA199221,8967424,2015,Osteosarcoma: Patient Derived Xenograft Preclinical Testing,"﻿ DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Osteosarcoma is a disease in which the recent lack of progress in improving patient survival strongly suggests the need for novel treatment approaches. A panel of well characterized osteosarcoma patient derived xenografts with genetic changes recapitulating the disease, have been tested by our laboratory as part of the Pediatric Preclinical Testing Program. These efforts thus far have been highly successful in identifying several drugs which are currently being or about to be tested in osteosarcoma clinical trials conducted by the Children's Oncology Group - specifically eribulin and glembatumumab vedotin. Numerous additional osteosarcoma patient derived xenograft models have been developed potentially permitting expansion of the panel of tumors assessed. In this proposal exploration of using a more efficient approach to screen for drug activity in the established models may permit utilization of a broader panel of osteosarcoma patient derived xenografts. In this proposal eltrombopag will be explored for activity in the treatment of osteosarcoma based on promising in vitro data. Building on prior findings, eribulin will be tested for additive activiy with agents routinely used in the treatment of osteosarcoma including cisplatin, cyclophosphamide and etoposide.

1U01CA199288-01,U01CA199288,8968148,2015,In Vivo Drug Testing of Pediatric CNS Tumors Using Patient Derived Orthotopic Xenograft Models,"﻿ DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is prepared in response to the funding opportunity: Pediatric Preclinical Testing Consortium Research Programs (U01), RFA-CA-14-018. Specifically, we propose for Type B: Research Program for tumors of central nervous system (CNS) in vivo testing. Brain tumors are the leading cause of cancer-related death in children. One of the challenges in clinical drug development is how to effectively prioritize drug candidates to ensure clinical success in cancer patients. As pediatric drug candidates are much more numerous than the small number of patients, it is essential to perform comprehensive pre-clinical testing to identify the investigational agents that are most likely to be effective in the clinic. However, such effort has been blocked for many years due to the lack of clinically relevant and molecularly accurate model systems. Fortunately, we have established a large panel (>70) of patient derived orthotopic xenograft (PDOX) models of pediatric brain tumors through direct injection of patient tumor specimens into the brains of SCID mice. These PDOX models are shown to have replicated the histopathological features, invasive phenotypes and major genetic abnormalities (gene expression, DNA copy number and gene mutations) of the original primary tumors even during serial sub-transplantations in vivo in mouse brains. The xenograft tumor cells can also be cryopreserved for sustained and on-demand supply of tumorigenic PDOX cells. This capacity combined with our optimized surgical procedure, with which we can implant up to 260 mice per day, makes it possible for us to test multiple (e.g., 6-10) drugs per year for every tumor type. Our objective is therefore to make use of this unique panel of PDOX models to examine therapeutic efficacy of new agents and to analyze mechanisms of action and therapy resistance in high grade glioma, medulloblastoma and ependymoma. Our hypothesis is that these patient-specific PDOX tumors will respond to anti-cancer therapies similarly to the corresponding human primary tumors, and the effective agents identified through this system would have better chances of clinical success. To test this hypothesis, we will perform a series of in vitro and in vivo assays to achieve the following aims: 1) to identify genetically accurate candidate PDOX models that bear the therapeutic target(s) of new investigational drugs through data mining of our mouse model molecular characterization databases; 2) to select the most responsive models through functional in vitro screening to determine time- and dose- responses; 3) to demonstrate therapeutic efficacy of new investigational drugs in multiple target-bearing PDOX models; and 4) to perform detailed analysis of cellular and molecular mechanisms of cell killing as well as the causes of therapy resistance both in vitro and in vivo. Our novel panel of PDOX mouse models represents a broad spectrum of genetic abnormalities of pediatric CNS tumors. All the assays are well established and routinely performed in our laboratory; we are uniquely positioned to accomplish the proposed drug studies in vivo.

Our lab’s long- term mission is to identify novel molecular targets in osteosarcoma via comprehensive genomic and proteomic profiling of patient-derived cell lines and xenografts as well as human tumors with the ultimate goal of identifying and/or developing and testing therapeutics against these targets. To achieve this goal, we have a) built a robust profiling platform to identify novel targets; b) expanded our repertoire of osteosarcoma patient derived xenograft (PDX) models to reflect disease heterogeneity; and c) conducted high-throughput in vivo testing of 8-10 new agents each year both as part of Pediatric Preclinical Testing Consortium (PPTC) as well as independent of it. All of these efforts form the basis of our current research proposal and place us strongly poised to successfully achieve our goals. Our overall objective is to efficiently evaluate the efficacy of new agents with high potential to have activity in osteosarcoma based on target data from our genomic and proteomic profiling both as single agents and in rational combinations, with the vision of moving effective agents into clinical trials through the Children’s Oncology Group. We have three specific aims- 1) to select and test agents in vivo against surface targets identified by comprehensive proteomic profiling of osteosarcoma xenografts and patient tumors; 2) to select and test agents in vivo against targets identified by comprehensive genomic profiling of osteosarcoma xenografts and patient tumors; and 3) to perform testing of rationally combined agents based on target, toxicity and efficacy data of single agents. Agents from the PPTC pipeline will be selected based on either the proteomic target or genomic alteration being present in at least a subset of available osteosarcoma PDX models. The agent will be tested in selected cohorts of low/ high expressing protein target or present/ absent genomic alteration. In cases with multiple models with target expression, 3-5 mice per model will be used and in cases with few models available, 8-10 mice per model will be used for control and experiment groups with an overall n per arm per experiment of approximately 30 mice. Standard PPTC procedures will be used for tumor implantation and treatment. Tumor dimensions will be measured twice a week and response quantified as per standard PPTC definitions of complete response, maintained complete response, partial response, stable disease and progressive disease. For combination studies, three potential types of combinations will be considered based on efficacy and toxicity data- a) two surface protein targeted agents such as two antibody-drug conjugates; 2) two molecularly targeted agents and 3) a surface protein targeted agent and a molecularly targeted agent.

We have three specific aims- 1) to select and test agents in vivo against surface targets identified by comprehensive proteomic profiling of osteosarcoma xenografts and patient tumors; 2) to select and test agents in vivo against targets identified by comprehensive genomic profiling of osteosarcoma xenografts and patient tumors; and 3) to perform testing of rationally combined agents based on target, toxicity and efficacy data of single agents. Agents from the PPTC pipeline will be selected based on either the proteomic target or genomic alteration being present in at least a subset of available osteosarcoma PDX models. The agent will be tested in selected cohorts of low/ high expressing protein target or present/ absent genomic alteration. In cases with multiple models with target expression, 3-5 mice per model will be used and in cases with few models available, 8-10 mice per model will be used for control and experiment groups with an overall n per arm per experiment of approximately 30 mice. Standard PPTC procedures will be used for tumor implantation and treatment. Tumor dimensions will be measured twice a week and response quantified as per standard PPTC definitions of complete response, maintained complete response, partial response, stable disease and progressive disease. For combination studies, three potential types of combinations will be considered based on efficacy and toxicity data- a) two surface protein targeted agents such as two antibody-drug conjugates; 2) two molecularly targeted agents and 3) a surface protein targeted agent and a molecularly targeted agent.

5U01CA199221-10,U01CA199221,10870015,2024,Genomically informed agent selection and testing in osteosarcoma patient-derived xenograft models,"Project Summary/ Abstract Survival outcomes for patients with osteosarcoma have not changed since the advent of modern chemotherapy four decades ago and it has been challenging to develop new effective therapies in this disease. Our lab’s long- term mission is to identify novel molecular targets in osteosarcoma via comprehensive genomic and proteomic profiling of patient-derived cell lines and xenografts as well as human tumors with the ultimate goal of identifying and/or developing and testing therapeutics against these targets. To achieve this goal, we have a) built a robust profiling platform to identify novel targets; b) expanded our repertoire of osteosarcoma patient derived xenograft (PDX) models to reflect disease heterogeneity; and c) conducted high-throughput in vivo testing of 8-10 new agents each year both as part of Pediatric Preclinical Testing Consortium (PPTC) as well as independent of it. All of these efforts form the basis of our current research proposal and place us strongly poised to successfully achieve our goals. Our overall objective is to efficiently evaluate the efficacy of new agents with high potential to have activity in osteosarcoma based on target data from our genomic and proteomic profiling both as single agents and in rational combinations, with the vision of moving effective agents into clinical trials through the Children’s Oncology Group.

Specifically, we propose for Type B: Research Program for tumors of central nervous system (CNS) in vivo testing. Brain tumors are the leading cause of cancer-related death in children. One of the challenges in clinical drug development is how to effectively prioritize drug candidates to ensure clinical success in cancer patients. As pediatric drug candidates are much more numerous than the small number of patients, it is essential to perform comprehensive pre-clinical testing to identify the investigational agents that are most likely to be effective in the clinic. However, such effort has been blocked for many years due to the lack of clinically relevant and molecularly accurate model systems. Fortunately, we have established a large panel (>70) of patient derived orthotopic xenograft (PDOX) models of pediatric brain tumors through direct injection of patient tumor specimens into the brains of SCID mice. These PDOX models are shown to have replicated the histopathological features, invasive phenotypes and major genetic abnormalities (gene expression, DNA copy number and gene mutations) of the original primary tumors even during serial sub-transplantations in vivo in mouse brains. The xenograft tumor cells can also be cryopreserved for sustained and on-demand supply of tumorigenic PDOX cells. This capacity combined with our optimized surgical procedure, with which we can implant up to 260 mice per day, makes it possible for us to test multiple (e.g., 6-10) drugs per year for every tumor type. Our objective is therefore to make use of this unique panel of PDOX models to examine therapeutic efficacy of new agents and to analyze mechanisms of action and therapy resistance in high grade glioma, medulloblastoma and ependymoma. Our hypothesis is that these patient-specific PDOX tumors will respond to anti-cancer therapies similarly to the corresponding human primary tumors, and the effective agents identified through this system would have better chances of clinical success. To test this hypothesis, we will perform a series of in vitro and in vivo assays to achieve the following aims: 1) to identify genetically accurate candidate PDOX models that bear the therapeutic target(s) of new investigational drugs through data mining of our mouse model molecular characterization databases; 2) to select the most responsive models through functional in vitro screening to determine time- and dose- responses; 3) to demonstrate therapeutic efficacy of new investigational drugs in multiple target-bearing PDOX models; and 4) to perform detailed analysis of cellular and molecular mechanisms of cell killing as well as the causes of therapy resistance both in vitro and in vivo. Our novel panel of PDOX mouse models represents a broad spectrum of genetic abnormalities of pediatric CNS tumors.

The xenograft tumor cells can also be cryopreserved for sustained and on-demand supply of tumorigenic PDOX cells. This capacity combined with our optimized surgical procedure, with which we can implant up to 260 mice per day, makes it possible for us to test multiple (e.g., 6-10) drugs per year for every tumor type. Our objective is therefore to make use of this unique panel of PDOX models to examine therapeutic efficacy of new agents and to analyze mechanisms of action and therapy resistance in high grade glioma, medulloblastoma, ependymoma, DIPG and ATRT. Our hypothesis is that these patient-specific PDOX tumors will respond to anti-cancer therapies similarly to the corresponding human primary tumors, and the effective agents identified through this system would have better chances of clinical success. To test this hypothesis, we will perform a series of in vitro and in vivo assays to achieve the following aims: 1) to identify genetically accurate candidate PDOX models that bear the therapeutic target(s) of new investigational drugs through data mining of our mouse model molecular characterization databases; 2) to select the most responsive models through functional in vitro screening to determine time- and dose-responses; 3) to demonstrate therapeutic efficacy of new investigational drugs in multiple target-bearing PDOX models; and 4) to perform detailed analysis of cellular and molecular mechanisms of cell killing as well as the causes of therapy resistance both in vitro and in vivo. Our novel panel of PDOX mouse models represents a broad spectrum of genetic abnormalities of pediatric CNS tumors. All the assays are well established and routinely performed in our laboratory; we are uniquely positioned to accomplish the proposed drug studies in vivo. Our findings should provide strong preclinical evidence to support the initiation of clinical trials.",,Xiaonan Li,Purevdorj Baljinnyam Olkhanud,554886,554886,2024-06-18T12:06:00Z,2015-07-14T12:07:00Z,2026-06-30T12:06:00Z,RFA-CA-20-034,nofo_RFA-CA-20-034,lurie children's hospital of chicago,CHICAGO,IL,UNITED STATES,pivot,org_name,False

A panel of well characterized osteosarcoma patient derived xenografts with genetic changes recapitulating the disease, have been tested by our laboratory as part of the Pediatric Preclinical Testing Program. These efforts thus far have been highly successful in identifying several drugs which are currently being or about to be tested in osteosarcoma clinical trials conducted by the Children's Oncology Group - specifically eribulin and glembatumumab vedotin. Numerous additional osteosarcoma patient derived xenograft models have been developed potentially permitting expansion of the panel of tumors assessed. In this proposal exploration of using a more efficient approach to screen for drug activity in the established models may permit utilization of a broader panel of osteosarcoma patient derived xenografts. In this proposal eltrombopag will be explored for activity in the treatment of osteosarcoma based on promising in vitro data. Building on prior findings, eribulin will be tested for additive activiy with agents routinely used in the treatment of osteosarcoma including cisplatin, cyclophosphamide and etoposide. Finally, a novel ALK inhibitor that also has IGF-1R inhibitory activity, certinib, will be tested as a single agent and in combination with rapamycin for activityin the osteosarcoma patient derived xenografts. These results can be informative for future osteosarcoma clinical trials development as well as potentially identify novel agents that can be considered for clinical trials.",Acute Myelocytic Leukemia;Address;Adolescent and Young Adult;Agonist;Antimitotic Agents;Cell Line;Child;Childhood;Cisplatin;Clinical;Clinical Trials;Conduct Clinical Trials;Cyclophosphamide;Cytotoxic Chemotherapy;Data;Development;Development Plans;Disease;Drug Combinations;Drug Kinetics;Drug resistance;Ensure;Etoposide;Event;Future;Hormones;IGF1R gene;In Vitro;Incidence;Iron Chelation;Laboratories;Lead;Malignant Bone Neoplasm;Modeling;Molecular;Mus;Mutation;New Agents;Patients;Pediatric Oncology Group;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacodynamics;Phase;Phase II Clinical Trials;Physiological;Preclinical Drug Evaluation;Preclinical Testing;Primary Neoplasm;Process;Recurrence;Reporting;Resistance;Resources;Role;Sampling;Sirolimus;Staging;Syndrome;Testing;Therapeutic;Thrombopoietin;Translating;Translations;Xenograft Model;Xenograft procedure;base;bone;cell killing;chemotherapy;clinically actionable;clinically relevant;cytotoxic;data integration;data sharing;design;drug sensitivity;experience;improved;inhibitor/antagonist;molecular marker;novel;osteosarcoma;pre-clinical;programs;public health relevance;receptor;research clinical testing;response;screening;small molecule;targeted treatment;tumor;young adult,Richard G.

1U01CA274304-01,U01CA274304,10517972,2022,Reprogramming PDAC Stroma by Targeting Coagulation in the Tumor Microenvironment,"PROJECT SUMMARY The overarching goal of this research program is to identify therapeutic strategies to convert the stroma of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) to a chemo- and immune-sensitive tumor microenvironment (TME). PDAC is characterized by a desmoplastic stroma that facilitates tumor growth/invasion, chemoresistance of pancreatic cancer cells (PCC), and immunosuppressive TME. Highly packed cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and dense extracellular matrix (ECM) are hallmarks of the PDAC stroma and constitute physical drug delivery barriers. Several stromal components have been targeted to enhance drug delivery, but recent studies have suggested anti-tumor roles for the stroma as complete ablation of stromal components leads to more aggressive tumors. New strategies are highly desired to reprogram stroma without compromising its anti-tumor roles. The central hypothesis is that the coagulation system in the PDAC TME can be targeted to reprogram PDAC stroma to overcome chemoresistance, drug delivery barriers, and immunosuppressive TME. Cancer- associated coagulation has been reported as a key functional signaling pathway in PDAC. Notably, several coagulation molecular targets, including thrombin, protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1), and fibrinogen/fibrin, have been implicated in important roles contributing to tumor progression and therapeutic resistance. Specifically, it is hypothesized that the thrombin-PAR1 signaling axis can be targeted to suppress PCC growth/invasion and CAF growth/fibrosis. In addition, thrombin-mediated fibrin deposition can be targeted to suppress the drug delivery barrier and immunosuppressive TAM activities, which suppresses anti-tumor T cell activities. This hypothesis will be tested mechanistically and evaluated for translational potential by pursuing the following two integrated aims: Aim 1) Mechanistic Research: Determine the contribution of the coagulation targets in the PDAC TME. Specifically, the team will determine the role of thrombin-PAR1 signaling axis to CAF-mediated fibrosis, thrombin-mediated fibrin deposition on drug resistance, and PAR1/fibrin on the immunosuppressive TME. Aim 2) Translational Research: Evaluate the pharmacological inhibition of the coagulation targets. Especially, the team will expand the mechanistic understanding from Aim 1 using patient- derived PDAC models with FDA-approved inhibitors of thrombin and PAR1, and fibrinogen depleting agents. The effects of pharmacological inhibition will feedback to Aim 1 to delineate the efficacy of inhibiting coagulation targets. The outcome of this research will establish a new mechanistic understanding of the role of coagulation activities in the PDAC TME. It will determine whether blockade of the coagulation is a promising strategy to reprogram the PDAC stroma and, ultimately, suppress PCC/CAF growth and improve drug delivery and efficacy.",Ablation;Animal Model;Biomimetics;Blood coagulation;Blood specimen;CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes;Cancer Cell Growth;Cancer Etiology;Cessation of life;Chemoresistance;Clinical;Coagulation Process;Collagen;Data;Deposition;Desmoplastic;Disease;Drug Delivery Systems;Drug resistance;Evaluation;Extracellular Matrix;Extracellular Matrix Proteins;FDA approved;Feedback;Fibrin;Fibrinogen;Fibroblasts;Fibrosis;Goals;Growth;Healthcare Systems;Hyaluronan;Immune;Knowledge;Lead;Libraries;Malignant Neoplasms;Malignant neoplasm of pancreas;Mediating;Molecular;Molecular Target;Outcome;Outcomes Research;PAR-1 Receptor;Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma;Patients;Peptide Hydrolases;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacology;Reagent;Reporting;Research;Resistance;Role;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;Survival Rate;Syndrome;System;T-Lymphocyte;Testing;Therapeutic;Thrombin;Tissue Model;Translating;Translational Research;Treatment outcome;Tumor-associated macrophages;base;clinically relevant;drug efficacy;efficacy validation;health care economics;improved;in vivo;inhibitor;novel strategies;pancreatic cancer cells;pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cell;pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma model;programs;recruit;standard of care;therapeutically effective;therapy resistant;translational potential;tumor;tumor growth;tumor microenvironment;tumor progression;tumor-immune system interactions;vascular inflammation;venous thromboembolism,Melissa L Fishel; Matthew J.

1U01CA213359-01,U01CA213359,9246182,2017,Preclinical development of a DLL3-targeted theranostic for small cell lung cancer,"PROJECT SUMMARY Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is remarkable for exceptionally high metastatic potential, initial robust response to DNA damaging agents, and near universal development of resistance. This combination of predilection for early metastasis acquired treatment resistance – often times manifested as cross resistance to multiple agents – highlights a critical need for novel systemic therapies operating through a novel mechanism in order to achieve improved patient outcomes. Delta-like ligand 3 (DLL3), has recently been identified as a therapeutic target in SCLC. The highly tumor-selective surface expression of this protein make it an excellent candidate target for an antibody drug conjugate (ADC). Rovalpituzumab tesserine (Rova-T) is one such ADC that is showing encouraging efficacy signals in the clinic. However, despite apparent clinical benefit, this agent has also been associated with some severe adverse events attributable to the presence of the anthracycline PBD warhead. DLL3 targeting approaches are in need of both a real-time, quantitative diagnostic biomarker and a therapeutic approach with reduced toxicity. We propose a theranostic approach comprising on 89Zr immunoPET and a 90Y/177Lu radioimmunotherapeutic. The first Aim improves upon already promising bioconjugation chemistry. We are already able to obtain high-contrast immunoPET images using non-specific amine labeling and site-specific maleimide bioconjugation. We will improve upon this approach by developing more stable thiol-clickable methylsuflone chelators for 89Zr and 90Y/177Lu to minimize kidney dose. The second Aim identifies preclinical dosing parameters and comprehensively optimizes efficacy and toxicity in a traditional cell line xenograft. Our preliminary imaging data is focused on H82, an SCLC cell lined derived from a chemoexperienced patient. This cell line is very resistant to etoposide in vitro and in vivo and will be used to identify a radiotherapy dose that demonstrates efficacy in vivo, while minimizing dose to the kidney. Different dose ranges and schedules will be explored. The final Aim explores radiotherapy in a variety of in vivo contexts including lesion sizes ranging from 0.1 to 10 mm in diameter and representing both chemonaïve and chemoresistant disease. Radioisotopes have different energy deposition depending on the volume of the tumor being targeted. We will evaluate 90Y and 177Lu radioisotopes in different in vivo models of small cell lung cancer for the ability to eradicate lesions of different sizes. A unique resource in the lab is our collection of 10 paired chemonaïve and chemoresistant patient-derived xenograft lines. We will place particular emphasis on establishing efficacy in the context of acquired chemoresistance.

1U01CA235625-01,U01CA235625,9670435,2019,Employing CRISPR inactivation screening and in vivo models towards improving treatments for SCLC,"SUMMARY With a lack of druggable oncogenic mutations in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and no approved targeted therapies, we need to identify new treatment approaches for SCLC. In this proposal, we apply whole genome CRISPR inactivation screens to identify genes that are essential for SCLC broadly, or for key genetically defined subsets. We then determine whether pharmacologic inhibition of identified hits also results in selective killing of SCLC cells. We apply in vivo systems including patient derived xenograft (PDX) and genetically engineered mouse models to test pharmacologic inhibitors of key targets identified in these genetic screens. Aim 1 will focus on a pathway that we already identified using CRISPR inactivation screens to be essential for Rb/p53-mutant SCLC cells. Components of a NEDD8/RBX1 pathway, controlling Cullin activity and protein ubiquitylation, were essential for SCLC cells. Pharmacologic inhibition of NEDD8 activating enzyme (NAE) using MLN4924 in patient derived xenograft (PDX) models confirmed reliance of SCLC cells on this pathway. Excitingly, we identified examples of exceptional responses to MLN4924 in some PDX models. Aim 1: Apply in vivo models to direct NEDD8 inhibition to subsets of SCLC most likely to respond. Here, we explore the potential for inhibiting the NEDD8 pathway in SCLC. We will combine NAE inhibition with cisplatin-etoposide chemotherapy and determine whether durable responses result. Some SCLC PDX models exhibited exquisite sensitivity to NAE inhibition; we will identify underlying mechanisms and genetic features of super-responding PDX models that could be used to help predict exceptional responders. We will determine whether NAE inhibition should be directed to all SCLC patients, or to key subsets, and whether this approach augments response to chemotherapy. MLN4924 is already being tested in clinical trials for other cancer types and this work could rapidly lead to clinical trials in SCLC. Aim 2: Apply CRISPR inactivation screens to identify new therapeutic targets for SCLC. This Aim will extend our CRISPR inactivation screens to include mouse SCLC cell lines with key driver mutations beyond Rb/p53, including Pten, Crebbp and Mycl. Our approach takes advantage of the fact that while human SCLC has an extremely high mutational burden, leading to extensive heterogeneity among SCLC with a given driver mutation, mouse SCLC with defined driver alterations are more homogenous, increasing signal to noise in identifying vulnerabilities. We will identify dependencies in genetically-defined subsets of SCLC and will test inhibitors of identified druggable targets in PDX and GEM models that harbor defined genetic alterations. We leverage available mouse models and derived cell lines, along with a bank of genetically annotated PDX models, studied in vivo and ex vivo, to identify and evaluate completely new ways to target key genetic subsets of SCLC.",Biology;Cancer Model;Cancer Patient;Cancer cell line;Cell Death;Cell Line;Cisplatin;Clinical Trials;Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats;Cullin Proteins;Dependence;Enzyme Inhibition;Enzymes;Epithelium;Essential Genes;Etoposide;Exhibits;Gene Deletion;Genes;Genetic;Genetic Models;Genetic Screening;Genetic Transcription;Genetically Engineered Mouse;Genotype;Goals;Heterogeneity;Human;Lead;Link;Lung;MYCL1 gene;Modeling;Molecular;Mus;Mutate;Mutation;Neuroendocrine Tumors;Noise;Oncogenic;Pathway interactions;Patients;Pharmacology;Proteins;RBX1 gene;Signal Transduction;System;TP53 gene;Testing;Therapeutic;Tumor Cell Line;Tumor Volume;Work;Xenograft Model;Xenograft procedure;actionable mutation;base;cancer cell;cancer type;chemotherapy;drug sensitivity;druggable target;efficacy testing;exceptional responders;gene function;improved;in vivo;in vivo Model;inhibitor/antagonist;knock-down;lung small cell carcinoma;mouse model;mutant;neuroendocrine differentiation;new therapeutic target;novel;novel strategies;novel therapeutics;overexpression;programs;response;screening;small molecule inhibitor;targeted treatment;tumor;whole genome,David Macpherson,Suzanne L Forry,516606,516606,2019-03-06T12:03:00Z,2019-03-08T12:03:00Z,2024-02-29T12:02:00Z,PAR-16-049,nofo_PAR-16-049,fred hutchinson cancer research center,SEATTLE,WA,UNITED STATES,sclc,org_name,False
1U01CA256801-01,U01CA256801,10126626,2021,Optimizing Dual-Targeted and Dual-Armored CAR T Cells for Small Cell Lung Cancer,"ABSTRACT A patient's own T cells can be modified using gene therapy technology to express receptors, termed chimeric antigen receptors or CARs, which allow these immune T cells to recognize proteins on the tumor cell surface, and in turn allow these CAR modified T cells to recognize and kill the patient's own tumor cells. This approach has been successful in some hematological malignancies, however, it has not been successful to date in solid tumors including small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Two mechanisms by which SCLC may evade T cell-mediated killing are loss of expression of antigens, and suppression of T cell function in the tumor microenvironment. In this proposal, we will attempt to overcome these barriers by designing CAR T cells that target two SCLC antigens simultaneously, and that produce multiple factors (“armors”) that enhance T cell activity in solid tumors. We hypothesize that these dual-armored, dual targeted (DADT) CAR T cells will be more effective against SCLC than previous T cell-mediated and immune therapies. We have previously shown that CAR T cells targeted to either the antigen GD3 or to the antigen DLL3, both of which are expressed on the majority of small cell lung cancers, are capable of killing SCLC cells in preclinical systems. Additionally, we have developed multiple armored CAR T cells that secrete factors such as IL-18, or an antibody-derived single-chain variable fragment (scFv) that blocks the immune checkpoint receptor PD-1, or an scFv blocking the phagocytosis-inhibitory signal CD47 on tumor cells. All of these armors enhance CAR T cell activity in our in vivo model systems through different mechanisms. In Aim 1 of this proposal, we will generate CAR T cells targeting DLL3 and GD3 simultaneously, to overcome antigen heterogeneity and antigen loss in tumors as a means of escape from T cell-mediated killing. Simultaneously, in Aim 2, we will test pairs of armors to identify the pair that is the most effective at enhancing the activity of single antigen-targeted CAR T cells against SCLC in vivo in immunocompetent systems. We then analyze the immune cells in the SCLC tumor microenvironment following CAR T cell treatment to assess changes mediated by the armored CAR T cells. Ultimately, in Aim 3, we will combine these approaches to generate CAR T cells that recognize GD3 and DLL3 and produce multiple armors. These DADT CAR T cells for SCLC may be suitable for further preclinical testing in preparation for clinical trials beyond the scope of this proposal, representing a novel therapeutic approach to SCLC. Given our robust track record in CAR T cell clinical translation, we fully anticipate having new CAR T cells suitable for clinical trials at the conclusion of funding. Additionally, these novel CAR T cells may be used as tools to explore the interactions between T cells and the SCLC microenvironment. The analysis of changes in SCLC tumors induced by the armored CAR T cells proposed here may reveal novel aspects of SCLC biology and illuminate mechanisms of immune escape and treatment failure in SCLC.",Acute;Address;Anti-CD47;Antibodies;Antigen Targeting;Antigens;Biological Models;Biology;CD19 gene;CD47 gene;Cancer Biology;Cell Therapy;Cell physiology;Cell surface;Cells;Clinical;Clinical Trials;Data;Development;Disease;Down-Regulation;Eating;Extensive Stage;FDA approved;Failure;Funding;Ganglioside GD3;Generations;Genetic;Genetic Engineering;Goals;Hematologic Neoplasms;Hepatitis delta Antigens;Heterogeneity;Human;Immune;Immune system;Immunocompetent;Immunoglobulin Fragments;Immunotherapy;In Vitro;Interleukin-12;Interleukin-18;Investigational New Drug Application;Ligands;Malignant neoplasm of ovary;Mediating;Methods;Modality;Molecular;Mutation;Patients;Phagocytosis;Phase I Clinical Trials;Pre-Clinical Model;Preclinical Testing;Preparation;Prognosis;Proteins;Refractory;Relapse;Resistance;Signal Transduction;Solid Neoplasm;System;T-Lymphocyte;Technology;Testing;Therapeutic;Treatment Failure;Tumor Antigens;Work;anti-PD-1;anti-tumor immune response;cancer cell;cancer therapy;checkpoint receptors;chimeric antigen receptor;chimeric antigen receptor T cells;clinical translation;clinically relevant;cytokine;design;gene therapy;genetically modified cells;immune checkpoint;improved;in vivo;in vivo Model;lung cancer cell;lung small cell carcinoma;macrophage;molecular targeted therapies;mouse model;neoplastic cell;neuroendocrine cancer;notch protein;novel;novel therapeutic intervention;novel therapeutics;patient derived xenograft model;pre-clinical;programmed cell death protein 1;receptor;response;tool;tumor;tumor microenvironment,Renier Joseph Brentjens,Suzanne L Forry,661095,661095,2021-03-30T12:03:00Z,2021-04-01T12:04:00Z,2021-08-31T12:08:00Z,PAR-19-361,nofo_PAR-19-361,sloan-kettering inst can research,NEW YORK,NY,UNITED STATES,sclc,org_name,False

5U01CA213359-05,U01CA213359,10172863,2021,Clinical development of a DLL3-targeted theranostic for small cell lung cancer,"PROJECT SUMMARY Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is remarkable for exceptionally high metastatic potential, initial robust response to DNA damaging agents, and near universal development of resistance. This combination of predilection for early metastasis acquired treatment resistance – often times manifested as cross resistance to multiple agents – highlights a critical need for novel systemic therapies operating through a novel mechanism in order to achieve improved patient outcomes. Delta-like ligand 3 (DLL3), has recently been identified as a therapeutic target in SCLC. The highly tumor-selective surface expression of this protein make it an excellent candidate target for an antibody drug conjugate (ADC). Rovalpituzumab tesserine (Rova-T) is one such ADC that is showing encouraging efficacy signals in the clinic. However, despite apparent clinical benefit, this agent has also been associated with some severe adverse events attributable to the presence of the anthracycline PBD warhead. DLL3 targeting approaches are in need of both a real-time, quantitative diagnostic biomarker and a therapeutic approach with reduced toxicity. We propose a theranostic approach comprising on 89Zr immunoPET and a 90Y/177Lu radioimmunotherapeutic. The first Aim improves upon already promising bioconjugation chemistry. We are already able to obtain high-contrast immunoPET images using non-specific amine labeling and site-specific maleimide bioconjugation. We will improve upon this approach by developing more stable thiol-clickable methylsuflone chelators for 89Zr and 90Y/177Lu to minimize kidney dose. The second Aim identifies preclinical dosing parameters and comprehensively optimizes efficacy and toxicity in a traditional cell line xenograft. Our preliminary imaging data is focused on H82, an SCLC cell lined derived from a chemoexperienced patient. This cell line is very resistant to etoposide in vitro and in vivo and will be used to identify a radiotherapy dose that demonstrates efficacy in vivo, while minimizing dose to the kidney. Different dose ranges and schedules will be explored. The final Aim explores radiotherapy in a variety of in vivo contexts including lesion sizes ranging from 0.1 to 10 mm in diameter and representing both chemonaïve and chemoresistant disease.

In this proposal, we apply whole genome CRISPR inactivation screens to identify genes that are essential for SCLC broadly, or for key genetically defined subsets. We then determine whether pharmacologic inhibition of identified hits also results in selective killing of SCLC cells. We apply in vivo systems including patient derived xenograft (PDX) and genetically engineered mouse models to test pharmacologic inhibitors of key targets identified in these genetic screens. Aim 1 will focus on a pathway that we already identified using CRISPR inactivation screens to be essential for Rb/p53-mutant SCLC cells.

Pharmacologic inhibition of NEDD8 activating enzyme (NAE) using MLN4924 in patient derived xenograft (PDX) models confirmed reliance of SCLC cells on this pathway. Excitingly, we identified examples of exceptional responses to MLN4924 in some PDX models. Aim 1: Apply in vivo models to direct NEDD8 inhibition to subsets of SCLC most likely to respond. Here, we explore the potential for inhibiting the NEDD8 pathway in SCLC. We will combine NAE inhibition with cisplatin-etoposide chemotherapy and determine whether durable responses result.

We will determine whether NAE inhibition should be directed to all SCLC patients, or to key subsets, and whether this approach augments response to chemotherapy. MLN4924 is already being tested in clinical trials for other cancer types and this work could rapidly lead to clinical trials in SCLC. Aim 2: Apply CRISPR inactivation screens to identify new therapeutic targets for SCLC. This Aim will extend our CRISPR inactivation screens to include mouse SCLC cell lines with key driver mutations beyond Rb/p53, including Pten, Crebbp and Mycl. Our approach takes advantage of the fact that while human SCLC has an extremely high mutational burden, leading to extensive heterogeneity among SCLC with a given driver mutation, mouse SCLC with defined driver alterations are more homogenous, increasing signal to noise in identifying vulnerabilities. We will identify dependencies in genetically-defined subsets of SCLC and will test inhibitors of identified druggable targets in PDX and GEM models that harbor defined genetic alterations.

5U01CA256801-03,U01CA256801,10380107,2023,Optimizing Dual-Targeted and Dual-Armored CAR T Cells for Small Cell LungCancer,"ABSTRACT A patient's own T cells can be modified using gene therapy technology to express receptors, termed chimeric antigen receptors or CARs, which allow these immune T cells to recognize proteins on the tumor cell surface, and in turn allow these CAR modified T cells to recognize and kill the patient's own tumor cells. This approach has been successful in some hematological malignancies, however, it has not been successful to date in solid tumors including small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Two mechanisms by which SCLC may evade T cell-mediated killing are loss of expression of antigens, and suppression of T cell function in the tumor microenvironment. In this proposal, we will attempt to overcome these barriers by designing CAR T cells that target two SCLC antigens simultaneously, and that produce multiple factors (“armors”) that enhance T cell activity in solid tumors. We hypothesize that these dual-armored, dual targeted (DADT) CAR T cells will be more effective against SCLC than previous T cell-mediated and immune therapies. We have previously shown that CAR T cells targeted to either the antigen GD3 or to the antigen DLL3, both of which are expressed on the majority of small cell lung cancers, are capable of killing SCLC cells in preclinical systems. Additionally, we have developed multiple armored CAR T cells that secrete factors such as IL-18, or an antibody-derived single-chain variable fragment (scFv) that blocks the immune checkpoint receptor PD-1, or an scFv blocking the phagocytosis-inhibitory signal CD47 on tumor cells. All of these armors enhance CAR T cell activity in our in vivo model systems through different mechanisms. In Aim 1 of this proposal, we will generate CAR T cells targeting DLL3 and GD3 simultaneously, to overcome antigen heterogeneity and antigen loss in tumors as a means of escape from T cell-mediated killing. Simultaneously, in Aim 2, we will test pairs of armors to identify the pair that is the most effective at enhancing the activity of single antigen-targeted CAR T cells against SCLC in vivo in immunocompetent systems. We then analyze the immune cells in the SCLC tumor microenvironment following CAR T cell treatment to assess changes mediated by the armored CAR T cells. Ultimately, in Aim 3, we will combine these approaches to generate CAR T cells that recognize GD3 and DLL3 and produce multiple armors. These DADT CAR T cells for SCLC may be suitable for further preclinical testing in preparation for clinical trials beyond the scope of this proposal, representing a novel therapeutic approach to SCLC. Given our robust track record in CAR T cell clinical translation, we fully anticipate having new CAR T cells suitable for clinical trials at the conclusion of funding. Additionally, these novel CAR T cells may be used as tools to explore the interactions between T cells and the SCLC microenvironment.

MLN4924 is already being tested in clinical trials for other cancer types and this work could rapidly lead to clinical trials in SCLC. Aim 2: Apply CRISPR inactivation screens to identify new therapeutic targets for SCLC. This Aim will extend our CRISPR inactivation screens to include mouse SCLC cell lines with key driver mutations beyond Rb/p53, including Pten, Crebbp and Mycl. Our approach takes advantage of the fact that while human SCLC has an extremely high mutational burden, leading to extensive heterogeneity among SCLC with a given driver mutation, mouse SCLC with defined driver alterations are more homogenous, increasing signal to noise in identifying vulnerabilities. We will identify dependencies in genetically-defined subsets of SCLC and will test inhibitors of identified druggable targets in PDX and GEM models that harbor defined genetic alterations. We leverage available mouse models and derived cell lines, along with a bank of genetically annotated PDX models, studied in vivo and ex vivo, to identify and evaluate completely new ways to target key genetic subsets of SCLC.",Biology;Cancer Model;Cancer Patient;Cancer cell line;Cell Death;Cell Line;Cisplatin;Clinical Trials;Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats;Cullin Proteins;Dependence;Enzyme Inhibition;Enzymes;Epithelial;Essential Genes;Etoposide;Exhibits;Gene Deletion;Genes;Genetic;Genetic Models;Genetic Screening;Genetic Transcription;Genetically Engineered Mouse;Genotype;Goals;Heterogeneity;Human;Lead;Link;Lung;MYCL1 gene;Modeling;Molecular;Mus;Mutate;Mutation;Neuroendocrine Tumors;Noise;Oncogenic;Pathway interactions;Patients;Pharmacology;Proteins;RBX1 gene;Signal Transduction;System;TP53 gene;Testing;Therapeutic;Tumor Cell Line;Tumor Volume;Work;base;cancer type;chemotherapy;driver mutation;drug sensitivity;druggable target;efficacy testing;exceptional responders;gene function;improved;in vivo;in vivo Model;inhibitor;knock-down;lung cancer cell;lung small cell carcinoma;mouse model;mutant;neuroendocrine differentiation;new therapeutic target;novel;novel strategies;novel therapeutics;overexpression;patient derived xenograft model;programs;response;screening;small molecule inhibitor;targeted treatment;tumor;whole genome,David Macpherson,Suzanne L Forry,506274,506274,2022-06-09T12:06:00Z,2019-03-08T12:03:00Z,2024-02-28T12:02:00Z,PAR-16-049,nofo_PAR-16-049,fred hutchinson cancer center,SEATTLE,WA,UNITED STATES,sclc,org_name,False

The proposal comprises clinical, translational, and basic science investigators with significant NCI support related to the focus of the application. The thematics targeted are a natural extension on the funded research of SPORE investigators and include: novel clinical trials with assessment of surrogate markers of response, the identification of markers of breast cancer risk in pre-neoplastic syndromes, and the discovery of proteins predictive of breast cancer invasiveness and therapeutic response using imaging mass spectrometry. Project 1 will determine the antitumor effect of OSI-774, an inhibitor of the HER (erbB) signaling network in patients with operable breast cancer and identify a molecular profile associated with evidence of response in situ. This will identify a population that can be the target of randomized trials with HER signaling inhibitors. Project 2 will determine if paclitaxel administration to patients with locally advanced breast cancer leads to tumor cell transit into mitosis, loss of proliferation, and apoptosis, and if these events predict for tumor response. Both of these Projects will use imaging mass spectrometry to discover novel protein profiles predictive of drug action in two non-overlapping patient populations. Project 3 will use imaging mass spectrometry in microdissected primary breast cancers to identify proteins that segregate DCIS from invasive cancer and tumor from non-tumor stroma. In a mouse model of breast cancer this Project will spatially profile anticancer drugs with mass spectrometric evidence of drug action on established and novel protein targets. Project 4 will determine if alterations in components of the TGF-beta and EGF receptor pathways are associated with enhanced breast cancer risk in the Nashville Breast Cohort, a large cohort of women with 14 years of follow-up and with available archival material. This Project will also address for the first time in African-Americans in this cohort, whether breast cancer risk is affected by breast hyperplasia. To support these translational projects, we propose six CORES: Administrative and Outreach, Tissue, Proteomics and Emerging Technologies, Antibody Production and Characterization, Biostatistics, and Biomedical Informatics. The proposed Developmental Research (Pilot) and Career Development Programs are tightly integrated with Institutional initiatives and mechanisms that identify local research strengths as well as the best translational researchers. For these two Programs and the Tissue Core, the SPORE has harnessed significant matching support from the VICC and VUMC.

It is comprised of investigators with expertise in cellular signaling and molecular biology, breast pathology, medical, surgical, and radiation oncology, clinical trial design, epidemiology and population studies, mass spectrometry, imaging, biostatistics, and biomedical informatics. We have made progress in our previous funding cycle, have established productive collaborations with other SPOREs and other national and international groups, and have firmly established a true multidisciplinary program which we believe will be productive in the years to come. In this competing renewal we propose four bi-directional translational projects addressing basic, clinical and population research questions in human breast cancer. Project 1: Resistance to antiestrogen therapy in hormone receptor-positive breast cancer (Carlos L. Arteaga, MD) Project 2: p63/p73 signaling axis as a target for treatment of triple negative breast cancer (Jennifer Pietenpol, PhD) Project 3: Cellular mechanisms of bone quality in metastatic breast cancer (Gregory Mundy, MD) Project 4: Genetic predictors of progression of premalignant breast disease (Jeffrey Smith, MD, PhD and William Dupont, PhD) In our opinion, these projects meet the eligibility criteria set forth in the SPORE guidelines. They span themes involving discovery of mechanisms of antiestrogen resistance, determining pathogenic mechanisms and new therapies for triple negative breast cancer, identifying genetic markers of breast cancer risk in women with preneoplastic mammary lesions, and investigating mechanisms and biomarkers of bone quality in patients with metastatic breast cancer. The SPORE has access to a substantial breast cancer population and an established record of accrual to clinical trials. The leadership of the VICC and VUMC has provided strong Institutional support for the success of the individuals involved in this application. A significant amount of support has been promised by the Institution in the event of successful funding of this application. Meritorious research applications for developmental (pilot) projects will be solicited from throughout the VICC, VUMC, and Meharry Medical College. The SPORE has supported and will continue to identify and support the careers of young investigators starting a career in breast cancer and of more established investigators adding a promising domain in breast cancer research to their programs. To support the research aims in the translational research projects, we propose five shared Core Resources. Each of these cores supports at least 3 projects in this competing renewal application.

This project for the Administrative Supplement for NCI Global Oncology Mentored Research will assess response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer in patients undergoing breast cancer treatment in Kijabe, Kenya through a formal mentored research relationship between researchers at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and a faculty member (a medical oncologist/radiation oncologist) at AIC Kijabe Hospital. Dr. Christine Mwakio (medical/radiation oncology) is an early-career low-middle income country researcher (ESLI) who is actively involved in the care of breast cancer patients in Kenya. She proposes a two-part study. First, she will evaluate the clinical response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and the relationship between response to therapy and patient demographics, tumor characteristics, social determinants of health and treatment regimen in patients diagnosed with breast cancer at Kijabe Hospital. Second, she will compare the molecular subtypes of breast cancer with response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, correlating with residual cancer burden score in Kijabe, Kenya. Funds from this subcontract will support the salary of the ESLI, two research assistants, laptops for the research assistants to complete this project, funds to perform immunohistochemistry analysis on both breast biopsy specimens and surgical breast specimens, and use of public transportation for patients in the study to return to Kijabe, Kenya for follow-up. Dr. Ben Park (medical oncology) and Dr. Rondi Kauffmann (breast surgical oncology) comprise the research mentoring team at Vanderbilt. As primary mentor, Dr. Kauffmann will be responsible for career development and research project mentoring for the ESLI.

The projects are as follows: Project 2 - Strategies to Improve Outcomes for TNBC Patients Integrating Subtype-specific Genomic and Immune-based Discoveries; Project 4 - Targeting Antigen Presentation to Improve Immunotherapy Responses in Breast Cancer; and Project 5 – Liquid Biopsies to Guide Therapies in Triple-Negative Breast Cancers. The projects require three highly integrated shared core resources: Administration and Engagement, Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, and Pathology and Tissue Informatics. The cores bring innovative technology, resources, and personnel with project-specific expertise to the overall VICC Breast SPORE Program and do not duplicate pre- existing shared resources available at VICC or Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC). We have an expert multidisciplinary team that will accomplish the proposed aims and continue to have productive translational collaborations with other Breast Cancer Programs, SPOREs, and national and international groups.",,Jennifer A Pietenpol; Ben Ho Park,Naveena Basa Janakiram,896275,896275,2024-09-26T12:09:00Z,2024-08-01T12:08:00Z,2025-07-31T12:07:00Z,PA-20-272,award_P50CA098131,vanderbilt university medical center,NASHVILLE,TN,UNITED STATES,spore_breast_cancer_vanderbilt,org_name,True

The proposal comprises clinical, translational, and basic science investigators with significant NCI support related to the focus of the application. The thematics targeted are a natural extension on the funded research of SPORE investigators and include: novel clinical trials with assessment of surrogate markers of response, the identification of markers of breast cancer risk in pre-neoplastic syndromes, and the discovery of proteins predictive of breast cancer invasiveness and therapeutic response using imaging mass spectrometry. Project 1 will determine the antitumor effect of OSI-774, an inhibitor of the HER (erbB) signaling network in patients with operable breast cancer and identify a molecular profile associated with evidence of response in situ. This will identify a population that can be the target of randomized trials with HER signaling inhibitors. Project 2 will determine if paclitaxel administration to patients with locally advanced breast cancer leads to tumor cell transit into mitosis, loss of proliferation, and apoptosis, and if these events predict for tumor response. Both of these Projects will use imaging mass spectrometry to discover novel protein profiles predictive of drug action in two non-overlapping patient populations. Project 3 will use imaging mass spectrometry in microdissected primary breast cancers to identify proteins that segregate DCIS from invasive cancer and tumor from non-tumor stroma. In a mouse model of breast cancer this Project will spatially profile anticancer drugs with mass spectrometric evidence of drug action on established and novel protein targets. Project 4 will determine if alterations in components of the TGF-beta and EGF receptor pathways are associated with enhanced breast cancer risk in the Nashville Breast Cohort, a large cohort of women with 14 years of follow-up and with available archival material. This Project will also address for the first time in African-Americans in this cohort, whether breast cancer risk is affected by breast hyperplasia. To support these translational projects, we propose six CORES: Administrative and Outreach, Tissue, Proteomics and Emerging Technologies, Antibody Production and Characterization, Biostatistics, and Biomedical Informatics.

It is comprised of investigators with expertise in cellular signaling and molecular biology, breast pathology, medical, surgical, and radiation oncology, clinical trial design, epidemiology and population studies, mass spectrometry, imaging, biostatistics, and biomedical informatics. We have made progress in our previous funding cycle, have established productive collaborations with other SPOREs and other national and international groups, and have firmly established a true multidisciplinary program which we believe will be productive in the years to come. In this competing renewal we propose four bi-directional translational projects addressing basic, clinical and population research questions in human breast cancer. Project 1: Resistance to antiestrogen therapy in hormone receptor-positive breast cancer (Carlos L. Arteaga, MD) Project 2: p63/p73 signaling axis as a target for treatment of triple negative breast cancer (Jennifer Pietenpol, PhD) Project 3: Cellular mechanisms of bone quality in metastatic breast cancer (Gregory Mundy, MD) Project 4: Genetic predictors of progression of premalignant breast disease (Jeffrey Smith, MD, PhD and William Dupont, PhD) In our opinion, these projects meet the eligibility criteria set forth in the SPORE guidelines. They span themes involving discovery of mechanisms of antiestrogen resistance, determining pathogenic mechanisms and new therapies for triple negative breast cancer, identifying genetic markers of breast cancer risk in women with preneoplastic mammary lesions, and investigating mechanisms and biomarkers of bone quality in patients with metastatic breast cancer. The SPORE has access to a substantial breast cancer population and an established record of accrual to clinical trials. The leadership of the VICC and VUMC has provided strong Institutional support for the success of the individuals involved in this application. A significant amount of support has been promised by the Institution in the event of successful funding of this application. Meritorious research applications for developmental (pilot) projects will be solicited from throughout the VICC, VUMC, and Meharry Medical College. The SPORE has supported and will continue to identify and support the careers of young investigators starting a career in breast cancer and of more established investigators adding a promising domain in breast cancer research to their programs. To support the research aims in the translational research projects, we propose five shared Core Resources. Each of these cores supports at least 3 projects in this competing renewal application.

Using the well-established framework of a very active and strong multidisciplinary VICC Breast Cancer Program that is robustly supported by the SPORE mechanism, we have made significant progress in our current project period. Our highly successful Developmental Research Projects (DRP) and Career Enhancement Programs (CEP) continue to catalyze new ideas and new investigators in translational breast cancer research, including two projects in this continuing renewal. We are uniquely poised to complete the proposed work and to be even more productive in the years to come, thanks to an exceptional multidisciplinary program and established productive collaborations with other Breast Cancer Programs and SPOREs, as well as national and international collaborations. Our overall goal remains the same: To conduct collaborative, multidisciplinary and mechanism-based translational research that will have the highest possible impact for women and men with or at risk for breast cancer. After significant planning and internal and external advisory board evaluation, we propose four bi-directional translational projects addressing basic, translational and clinical research questions of importance in human breast cancer; Projects 1 and 2 are continuation projects, Projects 3 and 4 are new projects that have evolved from two CEP awards in the current funding cycle: Project 1 - Mechanisms of Resistance to Endocrine Therapy in ER+ Breast Cancer; Project 2 - Strategies to Improve Outcomes for TNBC Patients Integrating Subtype-specific Genomic and Immune-based Discoveries; Project 3 - Targeting the DNA Damage Response in Breast Cancer; Project 4 - Targeting Antigen Presentation to Improve Immunotherapy Responses in Breast Cancer. The application also includes DRP and CEP, and four highly integrated shared core resources: Administration and Engagement, Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, Pathology and Tissue Informatics, and Immunophenotyping.

These projects will be supported by an Administrative Core, a Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Core (BBC), and a Histopathology and Biospecimen Core (HBC).",Address;Antigens;Atypical lymphocyte;Autologous;Benign;Bioinformatics;Biological Markers;Biometry;CREBBP gene;Cancer Etiology;Cancer Patient;Cell Lineage;Cessation of life;Chromatin;Clinical;Colorado;Data Set;Development;Diagnosis;Diagnostic;Evaluation;Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center;Genes;Genetic Determinism;Genotype;Goals;Histopathology;Hybrids;Image Analysis;Immune checkpoint inhibitor;Immune response;Immunotherapy;Infiltration;Infrastructure;KDM1A gene;Lung;Lung CAT Scan;Lung nodule;Lymphocyte;Malignant - descriptor;Malignant neoplasm of lung;Medical;Methodology;Modeling;Mutation;Neoplasm Circulating Cells;Nivolumab;Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma;Oncogenes;Operative Surgical Procedures;Patient-Focused Outcomes;Patients;Performance;Phase I Clinical Trials;Phase II Clinical Trials;Plasma;Prognosis;Proteins;Research;Research Design;Research Personnel;Research Project Grants;Resources;Specimen;Survival Rate;T cell therapy;T-Lymphocyte;Testing;Therapeutic;Time;Translational Research;Vaccines;X-Ray Computed Tomography;antagonist;bench to bedside;cancer cell;cancer immunotherapy;career;checkpoint therapy;clinical care;cohort;early screening;effective therapy;human tissue;imaging biomarker;improved;industry partner;inhibitor;innovation;lung cancer screening;mouse model;neoantigens;neutrophil;novel;patient derived xenograft model;programs;radiological imaging;radiomics;receptor;response;risk prediction model;risk stratification;screening;small cell lung carcinoma;success;therapeutic target;translational cancer research;treatment response;tumor;tumor microenvironment,A Mcgarry Houghton,Peter Ujhazy,2447085,2447085,2023-06-26T12:06:00Z,2019-08-01T12:08:00Z,2025-05-31T12:05:00Z,PAR-18-313,award_P50CA228944,fred hutchinson cancer center,SEATTLE,WA,UNITED STATES,spore_in_lung_cancer_fred_hutch,org_name,False

The extensive scientific and clinical resources at the Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center (DF/HCC) will be leveraged – marshaling local expertise in cell and molecular biology, genetics, immunology, biostatistics, chemistry, murine models, and clinical trial development – in order to perform innovative pre-clinical studies, to validate novel drug targets in patient cells, and to design and implement clinical trials that will eventually lead to improved outcomes for patients with myeloid malignancies. Each of the four Projects will promote detailed analysis of a promising new target by a combination of pre-clinical studies to optimize therapeutic development and early-stage clinical trials. Project 1 leverages recent exciting data from the laboratory of Dr. Scott Armstrong regarding the efficacy of targeting the MLL-menin interaction, which is essential for maintaining HOXA expression and maintenance of leukemia stem cells. Project 2 is based on the discovery by the Stegmaier laboratory that many cases of AML are dependent on SYK kinase activation, and that SYK activation causes chemotherapy resistance. Project 3 will examine the pre-clinical and clinical efficacy of a novel SF3B1 inhibitor, using an Sf3b1-mutant model developed by the Ebert laboratory, for the treatment MDS. Project 4 will examine the potential synergy of a highly effective vaccine with a potent immunologic checkpoint inhibitor for the treatment of AML. The Cores have been designed to support all projects in translational research. The laboratory and clinical research components of each project will interface with Core 1 for statistical guidance in both experimental design and the interpretation of results. Core 2 will provide biospecimens banking for the samples produced by all projects in the course of clinical trials; these samples will be used for the generation of primagrafts in immunodeficient mice. Samples from the biospecimens bank as well as xenograft samples will, in turn, be available for use by the PI's of all projects.

These three Seattle-based and the British Columbia (BC)-based institutions have a large number of investigators and laboratories dedicated to prostate cancer (CAP) research. Within this milieu, there already exists substantial technical infrastructure (e.g., genomics), strong multidisciplinary expertise (e.g., molecular biology, biochemistry, epidemiology, genetics, medical & radiation oncology, urology), and extensive resources (e.g., serum, DNA & tissue banks, CaP animal model facilities, CaP genomic arrays, and a CaP clinical trials organization). All four institutions have, and are in the process of generating, increasing resources for programs in translational CaP research and are committed to contributing significant resources toward the goals of this SPORE. The purpose of the SPORE is not only to perform the research projects proposed, but in a larger sense to form the ""central supporting piece"" to a large developing ""mosaic"" of coordinated translational CaP research in the Pacific Northwest. We believe the projects to be innovative and translational. Project 1 is a population-based study evaluating specific genetic polymorphisms in relation to CaP progression/mortality. Project 2 aims to characterize molecular alterations (karyotype, transcript) of disseminated CaP cells in the context of influencing the clinical management of patients as diagnostic and prognostic indicators. Project 3 will identify critical determinants of the transition from androgen-dependent to androgen-independent CaP, and will validate these findings in well-characterized pre-clinical models and clinical trials. Project 4 seeks to expand our already extensive work on the genomics of CaP and will determine if tumor gene expression profiles can predict the course of disease and response to cytotoxic chemotherapy. We have proposed five Cores in support of these projects (Administration, Specimen/Tissue, Biostatistics, Informatics & Gene Expression, and Clinical Research). The Career Development and Pilot Project Programs we propose will significantly embellish and strengthen the translational orientation of our prostate cancer research and expand opportunities for new investigators.",clinical research; human subject; neoplasm /cancer genetics; prostate neoplasms,Paul H.

2P50CA165962-06A1,P50CA165962,9793304,2019,SPORE: Targeted Therapies for Glioma,"This is the competing renewal of a SPORE initiative on glioma at Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center. Our objective is to improve the standard of care for children, young adults, and adults with these tumors through the use of targeted therapies. Towards this end, basic scientists from Harvard Medical School and the Broad Institute join with clinical/translational investigators from Boston Children’s Hospital, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Massachusetts General Hospital. There are four projects: Project One targets pediatric low-grade astrocytomas (PLGAs). Nearly 75% of PLGAs are driven by activating mutations in the BRAF protein kinase. Clinician/scientists Daphne Haas-Kogan, M.D. and Karen Wright, M.D. together with structural biologist Michael Eck, M.D., Ph.D. will develop and test brain-penetrant targeted therapeutics for BRAF-mutant PLGAs. Project Two targets IDH-mutant gliomas which present typically in young adults. IDH-mutant gliomas produce extraordinarily high levels of the ‘oncometabolite’ R-2- hydroxyglutarate (2-HG). However, therapeutic exploitation of the differential 2-HG content between normal and malignant brain tissue has yet to be realized. Neurosurgeon Daniel Cahill, M.D., Ph.D. and cancer biologist William Kaelin, M.D. will address this therapeutic lacuna. Project Three targets adult gliomas. Recent studies by basic scientist Jean Zhao, Ph.D. show that in addition to suppressing cell cycle progression, CDK4/6 antagonists promote anti-tumor immunity and synergistically enhance the response to checkpoint inhibitors. Going forward, Dr. Zhao together with neuro-oncologist Patrick Wen, M.D. will test the hypothesis that brain penetrant CDK4/6 inhibitors can augment immunotherapeutic approaches to GBM. Project Four targets the neuronal microenvironment of adult and pediatric gliomas. Neuro-oncologist and developmental neurobiologist Michelle Monje, M.D., Ph.D. has shown that neurons promote glioma growth through activity- regulated secretion of neuroligin-3 (NLGN3) into the tumor microenvironment. Basic scientist Mario Suva, M.D, Ph.D. has refined methods for single cell sequencing of the multiple cell types within the microenvironment of freshly resected human gliomas. Working together, Monje and Suva will define the molecular mechanisms whereby microenvironmental NLGN3 modulates formation and progression of gliomas and explore a novel therapeutic opportunity embedded within the NLGN3 requirement.

2P50CA165962-11,P50CA165962,10935600,2024,Targeted Therapies for Glioma,"Project summary This is the renewal application of a SPORE initiative from Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center. We focus on gliomas of children and young adults. Our objective is to develop therapies targeted to oncogenic drivers and/or oncogene-induced vulnerabilities of these tumors. Towards these ends, basic scientists join with clinician scientists from Boston Children’s Hospital, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Massachusetts General Hospital. There are three projects: Project one targets pediatric low-grade gliomas (pLGGs). Nearly 75% of pLGGs are driven by truncation/fusion variants of the BRAF protein kinase. The project one team has made significant contributions to development of tovorafenib – a brain penetrant type 2 RAF inhibitor that is effective on all common BRAF oncoproteins. For this renewal application, the goals of project one are to reduce variability in response to RAF inhibitors such as tovorafenib and develop non-invasive “child friendly” tools to predict children most likely to require (and respond to) these drugs. Project two targets diffuse midline gliomas (DMGs) – the deadliest brain tumor of children. DMGs cannot be cured by conventional therapeutic modalities and the prevalent oncogenic drivers are undruggable. During the current funding period, the project two team has identified a synthetic lethal “addiction” to the alternate end joining pathway for DNA repair (“alt-EJ”) and identified brain-penetrant drugs that specifically target this pathway. Going forward, the goal of project two is to exploit alt-EJ repair antagonists as targeted therapeutics for DMG. Project three addresses the early-stage (lower- grade) IDH mutant gliomas (hereafter termed “IDHM”) of young adults. During the current funding period, the project team identified synthetic lethal vulnerabilities for the more aggressive (WHO grade 4) IDHM gliomas. Going forward, the goal of project three is to integrate these synthetic lethal therapeutic opportunities for grade 4 IDHM glioma into “the vorasidenib era” that has been opened by the recent clinical studies on early stage (grade 2) IDHM gliomas of young adults. The study plan employs contemporary methods in structural biology, cancer genomics, computer science and machine learning. Each project has a human endpoint, and two projects will involve clinical trials. Rigor and reproducibility of work will be fostered by cores for Pathology and for Biostatistics. An Administration core will enable and manage the multiple consortium agreements and collaborative interactions Harvard Medical School, the four participating Harvard teaching hospitals and facilitate clinical trials and imaging studies.

3P50CA165962-07S1,P50CA165962,10136362,2020,SPORE: Targeted Therapies for Glioma - Diversity Supplement,"Abstract Glioblastoma is the most common and the most malignant primary brain tumor with a median life expectancy of 15 months despite multimodal therapy. Its aggressive nature is in part due to its ability to escape immune surveillance and to redundant cell signaling that makes it resistant to single-agent targeted therapies. The cyclin D1-CDK4/6- retinoblastoma signaling axis has been implicated in cancer immune evasion and resistance to receptor tyrosine kinase inhibition in multiple cancers. As this axis is deregulated in 80% of glioblastoma, there is ongoing research into whether inhibition of CDK4/6 sensitizes glioblastoma to immunotherapy. This project builds on this work by exploring the role of the epigenetic machinery that is downstream of CDK4/6 signaling on glioblastoma immune evasion, as well as the role of CDK4/6 signaling on resistance to EGFR inhibition. To that end, we will determine whether inhibition of the polycomb repressor complex 2 (PRC2) or of the DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) triggers tumor cell-intrinsic anti-tumor immunity, and whether PRC2 or DNMT inhibitors synergize with immune checkpoint blockade in novel immunocompetent patient-derived models of glioblastoma. We will also determine whether combination EGFR and CDK4/6 inhibition synergize in a genetically engineered mouse model of glioblastoma driven by EGFRvIII, the most common EGFR mutation in human glioblastoma. We hope that this work will uncover rational combinations of targeted therapies or targeted therapies with immunotherapy that will serve as new therapeutic strategies for patients with glioblastoma.",CDK4 gene;Combined Modality Therapy;Cyclin D1;DNA Methyltransferase Inhibitor;DNA Modification Methylases;EGFR inhibition;Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor;Epigenetic Process;Genetically Engineered Mouse;Glioblastoma;Glioma;Human;Immune Evasion;Immunocompetent;Immunologic Surveillance;Immunotherapy;Life Expectancy;Malignant - descriptor;Malignant Neoplasms;Mediating;Modeling;Mutation;Nature;Patients;Polycomb;Primary Brain Neoplasms;Protein Tyrosine Kinase;Repressor Proteins;Research;Resistance;Retinoblastoma;Role;Signal Transduction;Tumor Escape;Tumor Immunity;Work;cancer therapy;epidermal growth factor receptor VIII;immune checkpoint blockade;immune resistance;inhibitor/antagonist;neoplastic cell;novel;novel therapeutic intervention;receptor;targeted agent;targeted treatment,Tracy T Batchelor,Hector Nelson Aguila,264010,264010,2020-09-15T12:09:00Z,2013-09-19T12:09:00Z,2024-08-31T12:08:00Z,PA-18-906,award_P50CA165962,brigham and women's hospital,BOSTON,MA,UNITED STATES,spore_targeted_therapies_for_glioma,org_name,True

Our objective is to improve the standard of care for children, young adults, and adults with these tumors through the use of targeted therapies. Towards this end, basic scientists from Harvard Medical School and the Broad Institute join with clinical/translational investigators from Boston Children’s Hospital, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Massachusetts General Hospital. There are four projects: Project One targets pediatric low-grade astrocytomas (PLGAs). Nearly 75% of PLGAs are driven by activating mutations in the BRAF protein kinase. Clinician/scientists Daphne Haas-Kogan, M.D. and Karen Wright, M.D. together with structural biologist Michael Eck, M.D., Ph.D. will develop and test brain-penetrant targeted therapeutics for BRAF-mutant PLGAs. Project Two targets IDH-mutant gliomas which present typically in young adults. IDH-mutant gliomas produce extraordinarily high levels of the ‘oncometabolite’ R-2- hydroxyglutarate (2-HG). However, therapeutic exploitation of the differential 2-HG content between normal and malignant brain tissue has yet to be realized. Neurosurgeon Daniel Cahill, M.D., Ph.D. and cancer biologist William Kaelin, M.D. will address this therapeutic lacuna. Project Three targets adult gliomas. Recent studies by basic scientist Jean Zhao, Ph.D. show that in addition to suppressing cell cycle progression, CDK4/6 antagonists promote anti-tumor immunity and synergistically enhance the response to checkpoint inhibitors. Going forward, Dr. Zhao together with neuro-oncologist Patrick Wen, M.D. will test the hypothesis that brain penetrant CDK4/6 inhibitors can augment immunotherapeutic approaches to GBM. Project Four targets the neuronal microenvironment of adult and pediatric gliomas. Neuro-oncologist and developmental neurobiologist Michelle Monje, M.D., Ph.D. has shown that neurons promote glioma growth through activity- regulated secretion of neuroligin-3 (NLGN3) into the tumor microenvironment. Basic scientist Mario Suva, M.D, Ph.D. has refined methods for single cell sequencing of the multiple cell types within the microenvironment of freshly resected human gliomas. Working together, Monje and Suva will define the molecular mechanisms whereby microenvironmental NLGN3 modulates formation and progression of gliomas and explore a novel therapeutic opportunity embedded within the NLGN3 requirement.

4P50CA165962-04,P50CA165962,9125763,2016,SPORE: Targeted Therapies for Glioma,"We propose a SPORE initiative on adult glioblastoma at the Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center (DF/HCC). Our objective is to improve the standard of care through the use of targeted therapies for this type of cancer. Towards this end, basic scientists from Harvard Medical School have joined with clinical/translational investigators from Brigham and Women's Hospital, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Massachusetts General Hospital. This initiative is supported by central cores for Pathology, Biostatistics and Administration and includes career and developmental programs. The study plan uses clinical materials and exploits a number of clinical trials to attack glioblastoma on four distinct fronts: Project one targets the tumor vascular system. A cancer biologist, Rakesh Jain, PhD and a neurooncologist, Tracy Batchelor, MD address a current impasse in vascular-based therapies for glioblastoma. Why are patient responses to bevacizumab generally transient and marginal? Jain and Batchelor will test the hypothesis that responses to VEGF pathway inhibitors can be augmented by concurrent or sequential suppression of the angiopoietin-2 signal transduction pathway. Project two targets the PI3K signaling axis - a signaling pathway that is activated in ~50% of glioblastomas. Biochemist Tom Roberts, PhD (a co-discoverer of PI3K) and neuro-oncologist Patrick Wen, MD address fundamental issues regarding PI3K signaling in glioblastoma that - when resolved - will greatly optimize the treatment of these tumors with small molecule antagonists of PI3K. Project three targets the IDH pathway. Malignant gliomas, including glioblastomas, may harbor gain-of-function mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) resulting in accumulation of 2-hydroxyglutarate (2- HG) promoting tumorigenesis.

Our objective is to improve the standard of care through the use of targeted therapies for this type of cancer. Towards this end, basic scientists from Harvard Medical School have joined with clinical/translational investigators from Brigham and Women's Hospital, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Massachusetts General Hospital. This initiative is supported by central cores for Pathology, Biostatistics and Administration and includes career and developmental programs. The study plan uses clinical materials and exploits a number of clinical trials to attack glioblastoma on four distinct fronts: Project one targets the tumor vascular system. A cancer biologist, Rakesh Jain, PhD and a neurooncologist, Tracy Batchelor, MD address a current impasse in vascular-based therapies for glioblastoma. Why are patient responses to bevacizumab generally transient and marginal? Jain and Batchelor will test the hypothesis that responses to VEGF pathway inhibitors can be augmented by concurrent or sequential suppression of the angiopoietin-2 signal transduction pathway. Project two targets the PI3K signaling axis - a signaling pathway that is activated in ~50% of glioblastomas. Biochemist Tom Roberts, PhD (a co-discoverer of PI3K) and neuro-oncologist Patrick Wen, MD address fundamental issues regarding PI3K signaling in glioblastoma that - when resolved - will greatly optimize the treatment of these tumors with small molecule antagonists of PI3K.

Our objective is to improve the standard of care for children, young adults, and adults with these tumors through the use of targeted therapies. Towards this end, basic scientists from Harvard Medical School and the Broad Institute join with clinical/translational investigators from Boston Children’s Hospital, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Massachusetts General Hospital. There are four projects: Project One targets pediatric low-grade astrocytomas (PLGAs). Nearly 75% of PLGAs are driven by activating mutations in the BRAF protein kinase. Clinician/scientists Daphne Haas-Kogan, M.D. and Karen Wright, M.D. together with structural biologist Michael Eck, M.D., Ph.D. will develop and test brain-penetrant targeted therapeutics for BRAF-mutant PLGAs. Project Two targets IDH-mutant gliomas which present typically in young adults. IDH-mutant gliomas produce extraordinarily high levels of the ‘oncometabolite’ R-2- hydroxyglutarate (2-HG). However, therapeutic exploitation of the differential 2-HG content between normal and malignant brain tissue has yet to be realized. Neurosurgeon Daniel Cahill, M.D., Ph.D. and cancer biologist William Kaelin, M.D. will address this therapeutic lacuna. Project Three targets adult gliomas. Recent studies by basic scientist Jean Zhao, Ph.D. show that in addition to suppressing cell cycle progression, CDK4/6 antagonists promote anti-tumor immunity and synergistically enhance the response to checkpoint inhibitors. Going forward, Dr. Zhao together with neuro-oncologist Patrick Wen, M.D. will test the hypothesis that brain penetrant CDK4/6 inhibitors can augment immunotherapeutic approaches to GBM. Project Four targets the neuronal microenvironment of adult and pediatric gliomas. Neuro-oncologist and developmental neurobiologist Michelle Monje, M.D., Ph.D. has shown that neurons promote glioma growth through activity- regulated secretion of neuroligin-3 (NLGN3) into the tumor microenvironment. Basic scientist Mario Suva, M.D, Ph.D. has refined methods for single cell sequencing of the multiple cell types within the microenvironment of freshly resected human gliomas. Working together, Monje and Suva will define the molecular mechanisms whereby microenvironmental NLGN3 modulates formation and progression of gliomas and explore a novel therapeutic opportunity embedded within the NLGN3 requirement. Rigor and reproducibility of work conducted in the four projects will be fostered by cores for Pathology and for Biostatistics and Computational Biology.

5P50CA165962-10,P50CA165962,10696098,2023,SPORE: Targeted Therapies for Glioma,"This is the competing renewal of a SPORE initiative on glioma at Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center. Our objective is to improve the standard of care for children, young adults, and adults with these tumors through the use of targeted therapies. Towards this end, basic scientists from Harvard Medical School and the Broad Institute join with clinical/translational investigators from Boston Children’s Hospital, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Massachusetts General Hospital. There are four projects: Project One targets pediatric low-grade astrocytomas (PLGAs). Nearly 75% of PLGAs are driven by activating mutations in the BRAF protein kinase. Clinician/scientists Daphne Haas-Kogan, M.D. and Karen Wright, M.D. together with structural biologist Michael Eck, M.D., Ph.D. will develop and test brain-penetrant targeted therapeutics for BRAF-mutant PLGAs. Project Two targets IDH-mutant gliomas which present typically in young adults. IDH-mutant gliomas produce extraordinarily high levels of the ‘oncometabolite’ R-2- hydroxyglutarate (2-HG). However, therapeutic exploitation of the differential 2-HG content between normal and malignant brain tissue has yet to be realized. Neurosurgeon Daniel Cahill, M.D., Ph.D. and cancer biologist William Kaelin, M.D. will address this therapeutic lacuna. Project Three targets adult gliomas. Recent studies by basic scientist Jean Zhao, Ph.D. show that in addition to suppressing cell cycle progression, CDK4/6 antagonists promote anti-tumor immunity and synergistically enhance the response to checkpoint inhibitors. Going forward, Dr. Zhao together with neuro-oncologist Patrick Wen, M.D. will test the hypothesis that brain penetrant CDK4/6 inhibitors can augment immunotherapeutic approaches to GBM. Project Four targets the neuronal microenvironment of adult and pediatric gliomas. Neuro-oncologist and developmental neurobiologist Michelle Monje, M.D., Ph.D. has shown that neurons promote glioma growth through activity- regulated secretion of neuroligin-3 (NLGN3) into the tumor microenvironment. Basic scientist Mario Suva, M.D, Ph.D. has refined methods for single cell sequencing of the multiple cell types within the microenvironment of freshly resected human gliomas. Working together, Monje and Suva will define the molecular mechanisms whereby microenvironmental NLGN3 modulates formation and progression of gliomas and explore a novel therapeutic opportunity embedded within the NLGN3 requirement. Rigor and reproducibility of work conducted in the four projects will be fostered by cores for Pathology and for Biostatistics and Computational Biology. An Administration core will enable and manage the multiple consortium agreements and collaborative interactions between Harvard Medical School, the four participating Harvard teaching hospitals and facilitate clinical trials and imaging studies.

We will investigate the optimal approach for screening and prevention of cervical cancer in HIV-infected Rwandan women, and assess the cost-effectiveness of different combinations of molecular tests in predicting cervical disease. We will also establish a cohort of Rwandan men who have sex with men (MSM) to determine the prevalence of HIV, type-specific HPV (anal and penile) and anal neoplasia, and follow them for two years to assess incidence of HIV, HPV and anal disease. We will continue to develop the human and physical pathology resources of our clinical partner RMH; establish a PCR laboratory that can perform HPV DNA typing but can be flexibly deployed to assess other pathogens. We will strengthen the Research Offices of RMH and UR with the goal of transferring to them the administrative and financial management and leadership of the Consortium over time.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the causal agent for almost all cervical and anal cancers, and ~50% of head and neck cancers. Cervical cancer, an AIDS-defining malignancy, is the most common cause of cancer deaths in women worldwide if not prevented through screening programs. The transforming capability of HPV is enhanced in HIV-infected women, whose HPV-related cervical lesions are more prevalent, more likely to progress, and more likely to become cancer. HPV also causes transformation of the anal mucosa. Unlike AIDS related Kaposi's Sarcoma and non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma, the incidence of cervical and anal cancers has not declined with the introduction of ART and remains elevated several fold in HIV-infected women and men. We propose a research consortium of Albert Einstein College of Medicine with the University of Rwanda (UR-academic partner) and Rwanda Military Hospital (RMH-clinical partner) to investigate HIV/HPV related cancers in Africa. Working with our trainees and partners and continuing to build upon our research infrastructure, all accomplished through our NCI/Fogarty-funded (D43) program ""Developing Rwandan Research Capacity in AIDS Malignancies"", we will develop a platform establishing the Rwanda-Einstein Consortium as a regional resource for HIV/HPV related clinical, translational and operational research.

1R01CA241137-01A1,R01CA241137,10121341,2021,A microengineered colon cancer-chip designed to investigate tumor-stromal interactions driving cancer progression,"PROJECT SUMMARY Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States. Despite the introduction of novel therapies, the five-year survival rate for metastatic disease remains around 10%. To improve our understanding of tumor progression and drug efficacy, it is vital to develop preclinical tumor models that accurately reflect the native pathophysiology of CRC “ex vivo”. The complexities of the tumor microenvironment (TME), including stromal cell types and mechanical forces, are not fully reproduced in existing preclinical models. Microfluidic-based “organ-on-chip” technologies, which are designed to simulate the 3-D human organ environment both mechanically (e.g., fluid flow and cyclic deformation) and biochemically (e.g., nutrient digestion, secretion, transport), have recently provided researchers with greater insights into and expanded control over the TME. In this proposal, we are adapting the organ-on-chip technology to create human colon organ chips colonized with patient-derived CRC cells and stromal elements (endothelial and cancer- associated fibroblast (CAF) cells) in relevant tissue:tissue compartments with integrated microfluidics and stretching to mimic in vivo peristalsis-like motions. The goal is to create a physiologically relevant, organ- dependent tumor model that will allow for long-term culture and characterization of CRC cellular dynamics, and serve as a platform for testing specific therapeutic modalities to prevent or delay tumor progression. Using novel imaging assays and “omics” based approaches, we will evaluate the role of the physical (i.e., peristalsis) and cellular (CAFs) microenvironment in colon tumor progression. In Aim 1, we will develop patient- derived CRC-on-Chips incorporating primary normal and tumor epithelium to assess CRC tumor growth and early metastatic spread (i.e., invasion into the vascular channel) in the presence of cyclic stretch, mimicking peristalsis. In Aim 2, we will analyze the impact of the stromal CAF microenvironment on tumor cell behavior and examine the extent and role of inter-patient CAF functional heterogeneity. In Aim 3, we will assess the drug screening capabilities of the CRC-on-Chip platform via monitoring of drug-induced cellular responses, and determine whether drug responses on chips can predict patient clinical responses. The longer-term vision for developing a microengineered CRC model that more closely resembles human disease is to expedite the identification and screening of novel drug targets and innovative treatment strategies with a focus on disrupting tumor-stromal interactions.

1R01CA241927-01A1,R01CA241927,9974147,2020,Tissue-Engineered Models of Microvessel-Mediated Glioblastoma Invasion,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is a uniformly fatal brain cancer with poor response to treatment and virtually inevitable recurrence. GBM tumors do not metastasize. Instead, they aggressively infiltrate the brain. Tumor borders are highly vascularized by microvessels that serve as key niche environments promoting GBM cell survival, treatment resistance and migration. Currently, it is believed that a subpopulation of treatment-resistant, stem- like GBM cells (GSCs) migrate away from primary tumors — remaining in close contact with local microvessels — and seed recurrent tumors — which are enriched in GSCs. However, the mechanisms underlying the influence of the microvessel niche on GBM cell migration away from primary tumors, leading to recurrence, remain largely unknown. To address this gap in knowledge, the proposed studies will investigate 1) the role of specific cues in the tumor microenvironment on the migratory phenotype of GBM cells and 2) how these cues differentially affect distinct subpopulations of cells within heterogeneous tumors, including GSCs. Our fundamental hypothesis is that the microenvironment surrounding tumor microvessels promotes GBM progression through both mechanical and chemical means. Aim 1 will investigate effects of mechanical cues and Aim 2 effects of biochemical cues present in the microvessel niche on migratory phenotype of GBM. To do this, we will use an innovative, tissue- engineered platform for 3D culture of patient-derived GBM cells to quantify how specific features of the microenvironment affect migratory behavior. We propose to modularly tune mechanical and chemical properties of culture platforms to characterize their independent effects on migratory phenotype of GBM. For some experiments, platforms will be constructed with an interface between defined microenvironments through which GBM cells can migrate, enabling separation of migratory and non-migratory cells for downstream analysis and providing information about how subpopulations of cells within a single tumor, such as GSCs, may respond differentially to microenvironmental cues. As treatment resistance, invasion and recurrence are inter-related events, we will investigate how exposure to routine clinical therapies may alter migratory responses of GBM to microenvironmental cues. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we will investigate the mechanisms underlying responses to specific features of the microvessel niche. Collectively, the proposed studies will make significant strides towards our understanding of how interactions of GBM with the microvessel niche promote tumor recurrence by characterizing: 1) biomechanical properties of GBM tumors and microvessels (Aim 1), 2) migratory response of GBM cells to biochemical and biomechanical cues (Aims 1 and 2) and 3) mechanisms governing the migratory responses to biochemical and biomechanical cues (Aims 1 and 2). In the long term, we expect these insights will lead to the development of new therapies targeting GBM recurrence. !",3-Dimensional;Address;Affect;Atomic Force Microscopy;Behavior;Biochemical;Biocompatible Materials;Biomechanics;Biomedical Engineering;Blood Vessels;Brain;Cell Culture Techniques;Cell Survival;Cells;Chemicals;Chemotherapy and/or radiation;Clinical;Coculture Techniques;Coupling;Cues;Development;Endothelial Cells;Environment;Event;Excision;Exhibits;Experimental Models;Exposure to;Extracellular Matrix;Glioblastoma;Glioma;Heterogeneity;Individual;Infiltration;Invaded;Knowledge;Malignant neoplasm of brain;Measures;Mechanics;Mediating;Modeling;Operative Surgical Procedures;Patients;Phenotype;Population Heterogeneity;Primary Neoplasm;Property;Recurrence;Recurrent tumor;Reporting;Resistance;Role;Seeds;Site;Stimulus;Time;Tissue Engineering;Tissues;Tumor Cell Invasion;Tumor Cell Migration;Xenograft procedure;base;brain tissue;cancer cell;cell behavior;cell motility;chemical property;combat;effective therapy;experimental study;innovation;insight;mechanical properties;migration;neoplastic cell;neuro-oncology;new therapeutic target;response;single-cell RNA sequencing;stem;targeted treatment;therapy resistant;three dimensional cell culture;transcriptomics;treatment response;tumor;tumor microenvironment;tumor progression;tumor xenograft;virtual,Stephanie Kristin Seidlits,Nastaran Zahir,339969,339969,2020-02-12T12:02:00Z,2020-02-13T12:02:00Z,2025-01-31T12:01:00Z,PAR-19-113,nofo_PAR-19-113,university of california los angeles,LOS ANGELES,CA,UNITED STATES,tec,org_name,True

5R01CA241137-04,R01CA241137,10744800,2024,A microengineered colon cancer-chip designed to investigate tumor-stromal interactions driving cancer progression,"PROJECT SUMMARY Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States. Despite the introduction of novel therapies, the five-year survival rate for metastatic disease remains around 10%. To improve our understanding of tumor progression and drug efficacy, it is vital to develop preclinical tumor models that accurately reflect the native pathophysiology of CRC “ex vivo”. The complexities of the tumor microenvironment (TME), including stromal cell types and mechanical forces, are not fully reproduced in existing preclinical models. Microfluidic-based “organ-on-chip” technologies, which are designed to simulate the 3-D human organ environment both mechanically (e.g., fluid flow and cyclic deformation) and biochemically (e.g., nutrient digestion, secretion, transport), have recently provided researchers with greater insights into and expanded control over the TME. In this proposal, we are adapting the organ-on-chip technology to create human colon organ chips colonized with patient-derived CRC cells and stromal elements (endothelial and cancer- associated fibroblast (CAF) cells) in relevant tissue:tissue compartments with integrated microfluidics and stretching to mimic in vivo peristalsis-like motions. The goal is to create a physiologically relevant, organ- dependent tumor model that will allow for long-term culture and characterization of CRC cellular dynamics, and serve as a platform for testing specific therapeutic modalities to prevent or delay tumor progression. Using novel imaging assays and “omics” based approaches, we will evaluate the role of the physical (i.e., peristalsis) and cellular (CAFs) microenvironment in colon tumor progression. In Aim 1, we will develop patient- derived CRC-on-Chips incorporating primary normal and tumor epithelium to assess CRC tumor growth and early metastatic spread (i.e., invasion into the vascular channel) in the presence of cyclic stretch, mimicking peristalsis. In Aim 2, we will analyze the impact of the stromal CAF microenvironment on tumor cell behavior and examine the extent and role of inter-patient CAF functional heterogeneity. In Aim 3, we will assess the drug screening capabilities of the CRC-on-Chip platform via monitoring of drug-induced cellular responses, and determine whether drug responses on chips can predict patient clinical responses. The longer-term vision for developing a microengineered CRC model that more closely resembles human disease is to expedite the identification and screening of novel drug targets and innovative treatment strategies with a focus on disrupting tumor-stromal interactions.

5R01CA241927-02,R01CA241927,10105312,2021,Tissue-Engineered Models of Microvessel-Mediated Glioblastoma Invasion,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is a uniformly fatal brain cancer with poor response to treatment and virtually inevitable recurrence. GBM tumors do not metastasize. Instead, they aggressively infiltrate the brain. Tumor borders are highly vascularized by microvessels that serve as key niche environments promoting GBM cell survival, treatment resistance and migration. Currently, it is believed that a subpopulation of treatment-resistant, stem- like GBM cells (GSCs) migrate away from primary tumors — remaining in close contact with local microvessels — and seed recurrent tumors — which are enriched in GSCs. However, the mechanisms underlying the influence of the microvessel niche on GBM cell migration away from primary tumors, leading to recurrence, remain largely unknown. To address this gap in knowledge, the proposed studies will investigate 1) the role of specific cues in the tumor microenvironment on the migratory phenotype of GBM cells and 2) how these cues differentially affect distinct subpopulations of cells within heterogeneous tumors, including GSCs. Our fundamental hypothesis is that the microenvironment surrounding tumor microvessels promotes GBM progression through both mechanical and chemical means. Aim 1 will investigate effects of mechanical cues and Aim 2 effects of biochemical cues present in the microvessel niche on migratory phenotype of GBM. To do this, we will use an innovative, tissue- engineered platform for 3D culture of patient-derived GBM cells to quantify how specific features of the microenvironment affect migratory behavior. We propose to modularly tune mechanical and chemical properties of culture platforms to characterize their independent effects on migratory phenotype of GBM. For some experiments, platforms will be constructed with an interface between defined microenvironments through which GBM cells can migrate, enabling separation of migratory and non-migratory cells for downstream analysis and providing information about how subpopulations of cells within a single tumor, such as GSCs, may respond differentially to microenvironmental cues. As treatment resistance, invasion and recurrence are inter-related events, we will investigate how exposure to routine clinical therapies may alter migratory responses of GBM to microenvironmental cues. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we will investigate the mechanisms underlying responses to specific features of the microvessel niche. Collectively, the proposed studies will make significant strides towards our understanding of how interactions of GBM with the microvessel niche promote tumor recurrence by characterizing: 1) biomechanical properties of GBM tumors and microvessels (Aim 1), 2) migratory response of GBM cells to biochemical and biomechanical cues (Aims 1 and 2) and 3) mechanisms governing the migratory responses to biochemical and biomechanical cues (Aims 1 and 2).

However, the late effects of cancer treatment, including permanent organ and tissue damage, hormonal and reproductive dysfunction and second cancers, are of special concern, with more than 40% of the estimated 360,000 survivors of childhood cancer experiencing a significant health-related quality of life complication from childhood cancer and its treatment. In addition, progress for a number of childhood cancers remains limited with approximately 50% of children with acute myelogenous leukemia, 50% of children with high-risk neuroblastoma, and more than 90% of children with brainstem glioma, still succumbing to their disease. The Children’s Oncology Group (COG), the world’s largest organization devoted exclusively to childhood and adolescent cancer research, and its multidisciplinary research teams comprised of more than 9,000 members, conducts research at more than 220 leading children’s hospitals, universities, and cancer centers. This proposal is for the COG NCI Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP) Research Base to continue its collaborative research work for our 26 community and 16 minority/underserved NCORP sites. With COG’s significant scientific, statistical, data management and information technology infrastructure, we seek to conduct pediatric clinical trials to define optimal treatments, and conduct laboratory research that will translate into more effective treatments with reduced side effects.

1U24CA220325-01A1,U24CA220325,9507097,2018,VU PREDICT,"Project Summary This application proposes a new U24 Oncology Co-Clinical Imaging Resource entitled VU-PREDICT (Vanderbilt University-PET imaging Resource to Enhance Delivery of Individualized Cancer Therapeutics). Precision cancer medicine, which seeks to exploit unique cellular, molecular and genetic characteristics of individual tumors to optimize treatment, remains a critically unmet need. Despite advances in biomarker technologies that yield high-quality cellular and genomic data, critical gaps remain to consistently match patients with cancer and ideal therapies. While `predictive' genomic assays based on RNA and DNA are now commonplace, current methods largely ignore tumor phenotypes differentiable by quantitative imaging. The overarching vision for VU-PREDICT is a suite of quantitative imaging tools that facilitate the discovery of novel, predictive imaging-derived gene expression signatures; such signatures can be deployed by the greater oncology community to improve the personalization of cancer treatment. The linchpin of VU-PREDICT will be positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. The sensitive and quantitative nature of PET, coupled with the ability to produce biologically active PET tracers, renders PET uniquely capable of both detecting tumors and profiling their specific features. Complementary to genomic approaches, PET imaging provides a quantitative, functional measure of tumor phenotype, and when coupled biopsy approaches, can provide a significantly greater breadth of biological characterization. VU-PREDICT centers on a parallel co-clinical trial of patients with advanced colorectal cancer (CRC) and human-in-mouse PDX (patient-derived xenograft) models. CRC is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs; cetuximab, panitumumab) are approved for treatment of advanced wild-type (WT) RAS CRC. However, durable responses to anti-EGFR mAbs occur in only 12–17% of patients. VU-PREDICT will capitalize upon a Phase I/II clinical trial opening at Vanderbilt combining a glutaminase (GLS1) inhibitor (CB-839, Calithera), EGFR mAb therapy (panitumumab) and irinotecan in patients with advanced and refractory WT RAS CRC. It is anticipated that combining CB-839 with EGFR mAb therapy will resensitize refractory CRC patients with Gln- avid tumors to EGFR blockade. VU-PREDICT will allow our development of quantitative PET imaging measures within this trial and in related preclinical studies that may identify patients likely to respond to combined GLS1/EGFR inhibition. We have four Specific Aims: (1) Optimize quantitative preclinical PET imaging protocols for Gln metabolism; Implement quantitative 18F-FSPG PET (2), 11C-Acetate PET (3), and dual-tracer 11C-Acetate/18F-FSPG PET (4) to discover predictive, imaging-derived gene expression signatures.",Acetates;Affect;Algorithms;Biological;Biological Assay;Biological Factors;Biological Markers;Biological Process;Biopsy;Cancer Etiology;Cancer Model;Cancer Patient;Cessation of life;Cetuximab;Characteristics;Chronobiology;Circadian Rhythms;Clinical;Clinical Trials;Colorectal Cancer;Community Clinical Oncology Program;Coupled;DNA;Data;Data Analyses;Development;Diet;Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor;Gene Expression Profile;Genomic approach;Glutaminase;Glutamine;Histologic;Human;Image;Imaging Device;Individual;Knowledge;Lead;Ligands;Location;MAP Kinase Gene;Malignant Neoplasms;Measures;Mediating;Metabolism;Methods;Molecular;Molecular Genetics;Monoclonal Antibodies;Monoclonal Antibody Therapy;Mus;Nature;Outcome;Patients;Phase;Phenotype;Positron-Emission Tomography;Protocols documentation;RNA;Radiochemistry;Receptor Inhibition;Refractory;Regimen;Reproducibility;Research;Resistance;Resources;Standardization;TP53 gene;Technology;Therapeutic;Tracer;Universities;Validation;Vision;Xenograft Model;Xenograft procedure;attenuation;base;clinical imaging;colon cancer patients;experience;genomic data;genomic predictors;imaging modality;improved;inhibitor/antagonist;irinotecan;mouse model;neutralizing monoclonal antibodies;novel;oncology;panitumumab;personalized cancer therapy;pre-clinical;precision oncology;preclinical study;predicting response;quantitative imaging;reconstruction;response;subcutaneous;targeted treatment;tool;treatment optimization;tumor,Jordan D Berlin; Henry Charles Manning,Huiming Zhang,664613,664613,2018-09-14T12:09:00Z,2018-09-14T12:09:00Z,2023-08-31T12:08:00Z,PAR-16-385,nofo_PAR-16-385,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,nashville,TN,UNITED STATES,cirp,org_city,True

5U24CA220325-04,U24CA220325,10266195,2021,MDACC-PREDICT,"Project Summary This application proposes a new U24 Oncology Co-Clinical Imaging Resource entitled VU-PREDICT (Vanderbilt University-PET imaging Resource to Enhance Delivery of Individualized Cancer Therapeutics). Precision cancer medicine, which seeks to exploit unique cellular, molecular and genetic characteristics of individual tumors to optimize treatment, remains a critically unmet need. Despite advances in biomarker technologies that yield high-quality cellular and genomic data, critical gaps remain to consistently match patients with cancer and ideal therapies. While `predictive' genomic assays based on RNA and DNA are now commonplace, current methods largely ignore tumor phenotypes differentiable by quantitative imaging. The overarching vision for VU-PREDICT is a suite of quantitative imaging tools that facilitate the discovery of novel, predictive imaging-derived gene expression signatures; such signatures can be deployed by the greater oncology community to improve the personalization of cancer treatment. The linchpin of VU-PREDICT will be positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. The sensitive and quantitative nature of PET, coupled with the ability to produce biologically active PET tracers, renders PET uniquely capable of both detecting tumors and profiling their specific features. Complementary to genomic approaches, PET imaging provides a quantitative, functional measure of tumor phenotype, and when coupled biopsy approaches, can provide a significantly greater breadth of biological characterization. VU-PREDICT centers on a parallel co-clinical trial of patients with advanced colorectal cancer (CRC) and human-in-mouse PDX (patient-derived xenograft) models. CRC is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs; cetuximab, panitumumab) are approved for treatment of advanced wild-type (WT) RAS CRC. However, durable responses to anti-EGFR mAbs occur in only 12–17% of patients. VU-PREDICT will capitalize upon a Phase I/II clinical trial opening at Vanderbilt combining a glutaminase (GLS1) inhibitor (CB-839, Calithera), EGFR mAb therapy (panitumumab) and irinotecan in patients with advanced and refractory WT RAS CRC. It is anticipated that combining CB-839 with EGFR mAb therapy will resensitize refractory CRC patients with Gln- avid tumors to EGFR blockade. VU-PREDICT will allow our development of quantitative PET imaging measures within this trial and in related preclinical studies that may identify patients likely to respond to combined GLS1/EGFR inhibition.

ZAMDAPP will, for the first time, provide a mechanism by which R01-style research projects led by Zambian scientists trained through the Fogarty International AIDS International Research and Training Program (AITRP, D43TW001429) and AIDS Malignancies Training and Research Program (AMTRP, D43TW010354) may be conducted in three areas critical to cancer research – virology, biostatistics and epidemiology, and cancer diagnostics. The Zambian personnel leading the research projects will benefit from mentoring by U.S. partners and support by a number of research core facilities. ZAMDAPP will leverage strengths in clinical care and treatment at CDH and UTH; strengths in molecular viral oncology research and cancer genomics at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln; and strengths in pathology, epidemiology, and biostatistics at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, while extending the work that has been accomplished through AITRP and AMTRP, which provide support for trainees to pursue advanced degrees. In addition to providing research funding, ZAMDAPP will provide diverse training activities in the United States and Zambia to engage the next generation of Zambian cancer researchers, increase local expertise, and enhance the transfer of technology. The partnership will lead to exchanges that build the technical and personnel infrastructure necessary to perform the high-quality and sustainable cancer research desperately needed in Zambia. Three specific aims will be accomplished: 1) develop the cancer research infrastructure at UTH and CDH through the establishment and enhancement two research core facilities; 2) provide an opportunity for former Fogarty trained fellows to lead hypothesis-driven research projects in the two more prevalent AIDS-associated malignancies, KS and OSSN, with the support of the U.S. partners and the core facilities; and 3) develop a pipeline of next generation Zambian cancer researchers through a) in-country workshops, b) pilot project funding, and c) short-term U.S. technical training. ZAMDAPP will build on successful ongoing Fogarty and National Cancer Institute training programs led by the PI and the leadership team in sub-Saharan Africa; implement a cross-disciplinary research and training program with different training tracks and in-country research projects that pair Zambian and U.S. researchers along with opportunities to conduct hypothesis-driven research projects; and be Zambian driven and benefit from broad local support.

5U54CA221204-07,U54CA221204,10581802,2022,Zambia AIDS Malignancies Diagnosis and Pathogenesis Program Supplement,"ABSTRACT The establishment of the Zambia AIDS Malignancies Diagnosis and Pathogenesis Program (ZAMDAPP) will support the U.S.-Zambia collaborations necessary to develop a robust cancer research infrastructure at Zambia’s Cancer Diseases Hospital (CDH) and University Teaching Hospital (UTH), with an initial focus on Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS) and ocular surface squamous neoplasia (OSSN) – two of the most common occurring HIV/AIDS-associated malignancies in the country. ZAMDAPP will, for the first time, provide a mechanism by which R01-style research projects led by Zambian scientists trained through the Fogarty International AIDS International Research and Training Program (AITRP, D43TW001429) and AIDS Malignancies Training and Research Program (AMTRP, D43TW010354) may be conducted in three areas critical to cancer research – virology, biostatistics and epidemiology, and cancer diagnostics. The Zambian personnel leading the research projects will benefit from mentoring by U.S. partners and support by a number of research core facilities. ZAMDAPP will leverage strengths in clinical care and treatment at CDH and UTH; strengths in molecular viral oncology research and cancer genomics at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln; and strengths in pathology, epidemiology, and biostatistics at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, while extending the work that has been accomplished through AITRP and AMTRP, which provide support for trainees to pursue advanced degrees. In addition to providing research funding, ZAMDAPP will provide diverse training activities in the United States and Zambia to engage the next generation of Zambian cancer researchers, increase local expertise, and enhance the transfer of technology. The partnership will lead to exchanges that build the technical and personnel infrastructure necessary to perform the high-quality and sustainable cancer research desperately needed in Zambia. Three specific aims will be accomplished: 1) develop the cancer research infrastructure at UTH and CDH through the establishment and enhancement two research core facilities; 2) provide an opportunity for former Fogarty trained fellows to lead hypothesis-driven research projects in the two more prevalent AIDS-associated malignancies, KS and OSSN, with the support of the U.S. partners and the core facilities; and 3) develop a pipeline of next generation Zambian cancer researchers through a) in-country workshops, b) pilot project funding, and c) short-term U.S. technical training. ZAMDAPP will build on successful ongoing Fogarty and National Cancer Institute training programs led by the PI and the leadership team in sub-Saharan Africa; implement a cross-disciplinary research and training program with different training tracks and in-country research projects that pair Zambian and U.S. researchers along with opportunities to conduct hypothesis-driven research projects; and be Zambian driven and benefit from broad local support.

To evaluate their potential for translation, we will integrate these dynamic models with clinical trials that will evaluate whether these phenotypic changes can be targeted for therapy. We hypothesize that acquired resistance emerges from selection acting on phenotypes during tumor evolution, and that simultaneously measuring and modeling subclone genotypes and phenotypes will identify new, and testable, therapeutic targets. Selective pressures from therapy and the tumor microenvironment can propel subclones from every patient's tumor along an evolutionary trajectory that leads to resistance. Indeed, our data shows that both genetic and phenotypic diversity among tumor subclones evolves as cancer cells progress to a resistant state. However, it is not yet known the specific phenotypes that promote that resistant state, the interactions among them, and how they converge to common resistant phenotypes seen in late stage cancer. To address these and other questions, we will develop a new class of dynamical systems models of subclone evolution to characterize the changes and development of key cell states that arise during acquired chemo-resistance and metastasis using our unique patient cohorts. These mechanistic models will identify points of therapeutic vulnerability that we will test in clinical trials aimed at blocking evolution to a resistant state by targeting critical resistant phenotypes. Our Center is comprised of an Administrative, Education/Outreach, Translational, and Computational Cores, in addition to two complementary projects. The synergies are derived from: 1) the convergent parameterization of the evolutionary models drawn from deep longitudinal patient progression studies (Project 1) and broad multisite metastatic tumor analyses (Project 2), resulting in a robust model to identify resistant states for clinical targeting; and 2) an integrated computational and experimental framework and resources for dissecting tumor heterogeneity and evolution that will contribute to an improved capacity for personalized cancer therapy. Our multidisciplinary team of systems biologists, bioinformaticians, tumor biologists, pharmacologists, mathematical biologists, and clinicians will tackle these scientific challenges. We will create programs to educate the next generation of scientists in systems biology and inform the community about the latest scientific advances and their impact on treatment strategies. And we will provide state of the art tools for the analysis of patient samples and tumor genomic complexity.

7U54CA209978-02,U54CA209978,9482409,2017,Combating Subclonal Evolution of Resistant Cancer Phenotypes,"Overall abstract Our Cancer Systems Biology Center of HoPE (Heterogeneity of Phenotypic Evolution) will develop a suite of systems-based methodologies to understand how genomic diversity, clonal evolution, and phenotypic change . To evaluate their potential for translation, we will integrate these dynamic models with clinical trials that will evaluate whether these phenotypic changes can be targeted for therapy. We hypothesize that acquired resistance emerges from selection acting on phenotypes during tumor evolution, and that simultaneously measuring and modeling subclone genotypes and phenotypes will identify new, and testable, therapeutic targets. Selective pressures from therapy and the tumor microenvironment can propel subclones from every patient's tumor along an evolutionary trajectory that leads to resistance. Indeed, our data shows that both genetic and phenotypic diversity among tumor subclones evolves as cancer cells progress to a resistant state. However, it is not yet known the specific phenotypes that promote that resistant state, the interactions among them, and how they converge to common resistant phenotypes seen in late stage cancer. To address these and other questions, we will develop a new class of dynamical systems models of subclone evolution to characterize the changes and development of key cell states that arise during acquired chemo-resistance and metastasis using our unique patient cohorts. These mechanistic models will identify points of therapeutic vulnerability that we will test in clinical trials aimed at blocking evolution to a resistant state by targeting critical resistant phenotypes. Our Center is comprised of an Administrative, Education/Outreach, Translational, and Computational Cores, in addition to two complementary projects. The synergies are derived from: 1) the convergent parameterization of the evolutionary models drawn from deep longitudinal patient progression studies (Project 1) and broad multisite metastatic tumor analyses (Project 2), resulting in a robust model to identify resistant states for clinical targeting; and 2) an integrated computational and experimental framework and resources for dissecting tumor heterogeneity and evolution that will contribute to an improved capacity for personalized cancer therapy. Our multidisciplinary team of systems biologists, bioinformaticians, tumor biologists, pharmacologists, mathematical biologists, and clinicians will tackle these scientific challenges. We will create programs to educate the next generation of scientists in systems biology and inform the community about the latest scientific advances and their impact on treatment strategies. And we will provide state of the art tools for the analysis of patient samples and tumor genomic complexity. These studies move beyond prior research by integrating cell population dynamics and cellular phenotypes with cellular genotypes, and will deliver approaches and a knowledge base to block or reverse the transition to a resistant state for advanced stage cancer patients. interact in the progression toward chemoresistant breast and ovarian cancer",,Andrea Hope Bild,Shannon K Hughes,1531573,1531573,2018-03-16T12:03:00Z,2017-05-15T12:05:00Z,2022-06-30T12:06:00Z,RFA-CA-15-014,nofo_RFA-CA-15-014,BECKMAN RESEARCH INSTITUTE/CITY OF HOPE,duarte,CA,UNITED STATES,csbc,org_city,False

These efforts have uncovered a staggering level of genome complexity in cancer. Although much is known about the function and clinical impact of recurrent aberrations in well-known cancer genes, less is known about which and how the more abundant, low-frequency mutations contribute to tumor progression. Effective translation of tumor genomic datasets into cancer therapeutics will require new experimental systems to inform the functional activity of targets in the relevant biological context encompassing inter- and intra-tumoral heterogeneity. To address these needs, we propose a CTD2 Center that will provide the research community high-throughput informatic and experimental approaches to characterize and validate pathogenic “driver” mutations and fusion genes as well as identify molecular markers that meaningfully predict responses or resistance to anticancer therapies. We will pursue the following Specific Aims: In Aim 1 we will implement an algorithmic framework for identifying driver mutations with high sensitivity and specificity. We will focus our algorithm development, training and testing efforts on predicting oncogenic, gain-of-function mutation drivers of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). These computational approaches will be amenable to the analysis of all cancer types. We will next engineer ~1,500 selected mutations and ~400 fusion genes into expression vectors along with cohorts of personalized, patient-defined coding mutations. In Aim 2 we will enter mutant alleles and fusion genes into GBM, PDAC and EOC context-specific, in vivo functional screens that take into account the importance of genetic context, tumor microenvironment and heterogeneity in the selection of single and combinatorial drivers of tumorigenesis. In Aim 3 we will determine the consequences of intra-tumoral heterogeneity on tumor sensitivity and resistance to therapeutic agents using DNA-barcoded, human patient-derived xenograft models that recapitulate the heterogeneity of cancer. We will determine the extent to which single targeted agents and their rational combinations alter tumor population dynamics. We will also leverage Aim 1 informatics and functional characterizations in Aim 2 and 4 to characterize “persistor” populations to identify aberrations associated with drug resistance. In Aim 4 we will use high-throughput functional proteomics, innovative protein- protein interaction assays and informer drug library screening studies to elucidate underlying mechanisms and therapeutic liabilities engendered by validated drivers.

1U01CA274970-01,U01CA274970,10538749,2022,Precision Clinical Trial Recruitment to Promote Cancer Health Equity Across Florida,"PROJECT SUMMARY Racial and ethnic minorities represent the fastest growing segment of the United States adult population, yet they remain significantly underrepresented in cancer clinical trials (CCTs). Low trust in clinical research and recruitment approaches that fail to address multilevel barriers to CCT participation are key reasons for minority population underrepresentation. Community health educators (CHEs) improve trust in research among underrepresented populations, yet relying on exclusively on CHE availability can limit intervention reach. Virtual CHEs (vCHEs) improve scalability by extending CHE capabilities and capitalizing on remote recruitment techniques. The purpose of the current project is to increase referral of diverse participants to NCI-supported clinical trials via a culturally responsive, multi-level intervention that utilizes vCHEs to reach diverse populations. We will consolidate existing referral channels within the ALEX Research Portal. ALEX offers a custom experience for clinicians, CHEs, and patients to facilitate CCT referrals. Clinicians can utilize the portal to refer to CCTs; CHEs can use the portal to create an avatar that can provide introductory information to patients and schedule video-conference follow-ups; patients, families, and community members can use the portal to easily navigate to key information and make self- and other-referrals. The ability to streamline information to patients and CCT referrals to study coordinators is expected to improve the overall referral to CCTs. The ALEX Research Portal utilizes the adaptive virtual human technology developed at the University of Florida that provides users with culturally and linguistically tailored CCT information. The ALEX Research Portal will be developed and launched across three distinct geographic areas of Florida (Gainesville, Jacksonville, and Miami). This unique collaborative opportunity will provide access to participants representative of the racial and ethnic diversity of the state as well as cancer centers conducting CCTs associated with national networks (ETCTN, NCTN). Guided by the Interactive Systems Framework for dissemination and implementation, our goal is to increase referrals to CCTs by optimizing the ALEX Research Portal for broad use. The outcome will be an evidence-based intervention that can be widely disseminated to quickly increase the referral of diverse patients to CCTs. This project will be conducted in three phases: (Phase I) establish a baseline of referrals and accrual of diverse participants to CCTs across multiple Florida Center Centers, (Phase 2) adapt and pilot the ALEX Research Portal using a randomized controlled clinical trial, and (Phase 3) scale the intervention by dissemination via the OneFlorida network. The proposed study will result in an empirically-tested vCHE Research Portal for increasing trust in CCTs among diverse populations that can easily be adapted and disseminated across the state to overcome challenges associated with recruiting diverse participants to CCTs.",Address;Adult;Black race;Cancer Center;Cancer Patient;Caregivers;Clinic;Clinical Research;Clinical Trials;Collaborations;Communication;Communities;Community Health;Complex;Custom;Data;Dissemination and Implementation;Elderly;Enrollment;Evidence based intervention;Family;Family member;Florida;Funding;Geographic Locations;Geography;Goals;Health Educators;Hispanic;Human;Interactive Systems Framework;Intervention;Knowledge;Language;Latino;Life;Linguistics;Malignant Neoplasms;Minority Enrollment;Minority Groups;Modeling;Morbidity - disease rate;Outcome;Participant;Pathway interactions;Patient Schedules;Patients;Phase;Population;Population Heterogeneity;Process;Randomized;Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials;Recording of previous events;Research;Resources;Role;Science;Screening for cancer;Source;Techniques;Technology;Testing;Translating;Trust;Underrepresented Populations;United States;Universities;Ursidae Family;Videoconferencing;Visit;Work;cancer clinical trial;cost;data repository;digital;ethnic diversity;ethnic minority;evidence base;experience;health equity;improved;member;minority patient;mortality;online community;patient portal;patient registry;preference;primary outcome;racial and ethnic;racial diversity;racial minority;recruit;secondary outcome;social media;user centered design;virtual human;web site,Olveen Carrasquillo; Janice Lee Raup-Krieger,Sandra L San Miguel-Majors,704063,704063,2022-09-09T12:09:00Z,2022-09-09T12:09:00Z,2027-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-21-063,nofo_RFA-CA-21-063,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,gainesville,FL,UNITED STATES,cusp2ct,org_city,False
1U24CA277825-01,U24CA277825,10597291,2022,"The Data, Evaluation, and Coordination Center (DECC) for Connecting Underrepresented Populations to Clinical Trials (CUSP2CT)","Project Summary Despite the decline in overall mortality and incidence of cancer in the US population, disparities in cancer care still largely exist within certain groups. One key barrier causing the lack of proportional representation of these groups is the lack of dedicated efforts employing scientific rigorous approaches and implementation strategies for increasing their proportional representation in clinical trials. The Connecting Underrepresented Populations to Clinical Trials (CUSP2CT) program aims to implement and evaluate multilevel and culturally tailored outreach and education interventions that will increase the accrual of underrepresented populations in clinical trials. To support the CUSP2CT program, we are proposing to be the Data, Evaluation, and Coordination Center (DECC) to support the data and evaluation activities and coordinate a learning collaborative towards mitigating the key barriers of cancer disparity. Specifically, we will collaborate with the CUSP2CT U01 investigators and interact with involved NCI staff members and with other stakeholders, as needed, to carry out the following activities: 1) establish effective and efficient administrative processes and infrastructure through scientific leadership, organizational processes, governance structure, effective oversight and operational procedures to achieve optimal communication, collaboration, coordination, and dissemination of the CUSP2CT research, 2) facilitate and coordinate data collection and management across the CUSP2CT program to facilitate evidence generation and rapid dissemination of methods and tools, 3) organize and facilitate collaborative efforts on program evaluation, engagement, and communication, and 4) foster a learning collaborative in leading and coordinating trans-CUSP2CT research.

5U01CA274970-04,U01CA274970,10912491,2024,Precision Clinical Trial Recruitment to Promote Cancer Health Equity Across Florida,"PROJECT SUMMARY Racial and ethnic minorities represent the fastest growing segment of the United States adult population, yet they remain significantly underrepresented in cancer clinical trials (CCTs). Low trust in clinical research and recruitment approaches that fail to address multilevel barriers to CCT participation are key reasons for minority population underrepresentation. Community health educators (CHEs) improve trust in research among underrepresented populations, yet relying on exclusively on CHE availability can limit intervention reach. Virtual CHEs (vCHEs) improve scalability by extending CHE capabilities and capitalizing on remote recruitment techniques. The purpose of the current project is to increase referral of diverse participants to NCI-supported clinical trials via a culturally responsive, multi-level intervention that utilizes vCHEs to reach diverse populations. We will consolidate existing referral channels within the ALEX Research Portal. ALEX offers a custom experience for clinicians, CHEs, and patients to facilitate CCT referrals. Clinicians can utilize the portal to refer to CCTs; CHEs can use the portal to create an avatar that can provide introductory information to patients and schedule video-conference follow-ups; patients, families, and community members can use the portal to easily navigate to key information and make self- and other-referrals. The ability to streamline information to patients and CCT referrals to study coordinators is expected to improve the overall referral to CCTs. The ALEX Research Portal utilizes the adaptive virtual human technology developed at the University of Florida that provides users with culturally and linguistically tailored CCT information. The ALEX Research Portal will be developed and launched across three distinct geographic areas of Florida (Gainesville, Jacksonville, and Miami). This unique collaborative opportunity will provide access to participants representative of the racial and ethnic diversity of the state as well as cancer centers conducting CCTs associated with national networks (ETCTN, NCTN). Guided by the Interactive Systems Framework for dissemination and implementation, our goal is to increase referrals to CCTs by optimizing the ALEX Research Portal for broad use. The outcome will be an evidence-based intervention that can be widely disseminated to quickly increase the referral of diverse patients to CCTs. This project will be conducted in three phases: (Phase I) establish a baseline of referrals and accrual of diverse participants to CCTs across multiple Florida Center Centers, (Phase 2) adapt and pilot the ALEX Research Portal using a randomized controlled clinical trial, and (Phase 3) scale the intervention by dissemination via the OneFlorida network. The proposed study will result in an empirically-tested vCHE Research Portal for increasing trust in CCTs among diverse populations that can easily be adapted and disseminated across the state to overcome challenges associated with recruiting diverse participants to CCTs.",,Olveen Carrasquillo; Janice Lee Raup-Krieger,Sandra L San Miguel-Majors,656994,656994,2024-09-05T12:09:00Z,2022-09-09T12:09:00Z,2027-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-21-063,nofo_RFA-CA-21-063,MAYO CLINIC  JACKSONVILLE,jacksonville,FL,UNITED STATES,cusp2ct,org_city,False

One key barrier causing the lack of proportional representation of these groups is the lack of dedicated efforts employing scientific rigorous approaches and implementation strategies for increasing their proportional representation in clinical trials. The Connecting Underrepresented Populations to Clinical Trials (CUSP2CT) program aims to implement and evaluate multilevel and culturally tailored outreach and education interventions that will increase the accrual of underrepresented populations in clinical trials. To support the CUSP2CT program, we are proposing to be the Data, Evaluation, and Coordination Center (DECC) to support the data and evaluation activities and coordinate a learning collaborative towards mitigating the key barriers of cancer disparity. Specifically, we will collaborate with the CUSP2CT U01 investigators and interact with involved NCI staff members and with other stakeholders, as needed, to carry out the following activities: 1) establish effective and efficient administrative processes and infrastructure through scientific leadership, organizational processes, governance structure, effective oversight and operational procedures to achieve optimal communication, collaboration, coordination, and dissemination of the CUSP2CT research, 2) facilitate and coordinate data collection and management across the CUSP2CT program to facilitate evidence generation and rapid dissemination of methods and tools, 3) organize and facilitate collaborative efforts on program evaluation, engagement, and communication, and 4) foster a learning collaborative in leading and coordinating trans-CUSP2CT research. We are uniquely positioned to be the DECC for CUSP2T leveraging strong track record in: (i) implementing health equity centers and consortia (e.g. Dr. Odedina is MPI on NCI CRCHD U54 CaRE2 Health Equity Center and contact MPI for a newly awarded Department of Defense iCCaRE for Black Men Consortium); (ii) leading statistics and data management coordinating center effort in cancer trials (e.g., Mayo is the Statistics and Data Management Center of the Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology (Alliance) including both interventional and NCORP grants); (ii) leading standardization and interoperability for practice and research (e.g., Mayo has been contributing to the NCI Terminology Service Development Effort and part of the data harmonization efforts in the NCATS Clinical Data to Health (CD2H)).

Given the increasing median age of the US population, the number of breast cancers diagnosed in older women is expected to rise by 50% in the coming decades. Older women with breast cancer experience worse breast cancer-specific outcomes as compared to younger women, under-treatment is likely to play a central role. Studies have demonstrated that breast cancer patients who receive <85% of received dose intensity (RDI), a metric that combines the total dose administered with adherence to the planned treatment schedule, have a 57% increase in the risk of disease recurrence at 10 years as compared to women who receive at least 85% RDI. Only 50-76% of breast cancer patients >65 receive an RDI >85, largely due to increased toxicity of therapy in these patients. Reducing treatment-related toxicity to enhance RDI is critical to improving disease outcomes among the growing population of older breast cancer patients. To this end, models predicting for severe chemotoxicity demonstrate that a number of potentially modifiable factors (commonly assessed as part of the geriatric assessment), are important determinants of chemotoxicity, including function, depression, and falls (or use of assistive devices). Exercise has a significant positive impact on each of these modifiable factors, in the general population and in cancer patients. However, data on the ability of exercise interventions to improve treatment tolerance and preserve dose intensity among older breast cancer patients are lacking. We propose a randomized controlled trial to assess the effects of a multicomponent, hybrid telehealth (TH) exercise and protein intake support (the THRIVE Intervention) on RDI, incidence and severity of chemotoxicities, functional status, muscle mass, and patient reported outcomes in 270 breast cancer patients age ≥ 65 receiving neo/adjuvant chemotherapy. Participants will be randomized to the THRIVE Intervention or to a Health Education and Support control group. The intervention will be delivered through a hybrid model, leveraging the existing Breast Cancer Weight Loss (BWEL) Trial call center. After 2 in-person, onsite exercise sessions, we will transition to TH sessions delivered on study provided tablets, by certified exercise coaches who will tailor behavior change to support adherence relative to symptom burden. To optimize intervention effectiveness, participants will undergo a TH evaluation of diet adequacy with a registered dietitian, focused on optimal daily protein intake. Protein supplementation will be provided if needed to achieve 1.2 gm/kg daily intake. The TH focus consolidates expertise at a well-established call center (BWEL), elevating the potential for broad implementation across the U.S., including cancer treatment centers with too few patients to justify necessary personnel. The project also seeks to evaluate intervention cost, as well as the facilitators and barriers to implementation of this TH intervention, toward the goal of translation to clinical practice upon successful completion of the THRIVE trial.",Adherence;Adjuvant Chemotherapy;Administrator;Age;Attenuated;Body Weight decreased;Breast Cancer Patient;Breast Cancer Treatment;Cancer Patient;Caring;Control Groups;Data;Diagnosis;Diet;Dietitian;Disease Outcome;Dose;Dose-Limiting;Effectiveness of Interventions;Elderly;Elements;Etiology;Evaluation;Exercise;Fatigue;General Population;Geriatric Assessment;Goals;Health education;Human Resources;Hybrids;Incidence;Inferior;Intake;Intervention;Mental Depression;Modeling;Nutrient;Older Population;Oncology;Outcome;Participant;Patient Outcomes Assessments;Patients;Persons;Physical Function;Play;Population;Proteins;Quality of life;Randomized;Randomized Controlled Trials;Recurrence;Risk;Role;SEER Program;Self-Help Devices;Severities;Sleep;Supplementation;Symptoms;Tablets;Therapeutic;Time;Toxic effect;Translations;Treatment Protocols;Treatment outcome;Treatment-related toxicity;Woman;aged;behavior change;breast cancer diagnosis;cancer therapy;chemotherapy;clinical practice;cost;disorder risk;exercise intervention;experience;falls;functional status;human old age (65+);implementation barriers;implementation intervention;improved;improved outcome;intervention cost;malignant breast neoplasm;member;mortality;muscle form;older women;predictive modeling;preservation;programs;protein intake;psychologic;psychosocial;resistance exercise;telehealth;treatment center;treatment planning;young woman,Nathan A.

CINJ provides an exceptional and unique resource for early clinical trials of new anti-cancer agents. Expected to reach a population of 9,000,000 by 2008, New Jersey has the highest population density in the United States, with an average of 1,174 people per square mile, which is 13 times the national average. Approximately 70,000 patient visits occur yearly at the main CINJ facility, and over 6000 new patients are seen each year. A statewide network of affiliated institutions facilitates referral for early clinical trials. CINJ has an outstanding clinical research infrastructure provided by several Shared Resources, including Biometrics, Centralized Education and Training Services for Clinical Research Personnel, Office of Human Research Services, Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics, Research Pharmacy, and Tissue Retrieval Services. Clinical informatics resources include electronic order entry, electronic clinical documentation, and a web-based clinical trials database that allows online monitoring of trial development, accrual, adverse events, and responses, as well as electronic data sharing with NCI trial monitoring systems.",Adverse event;Algorithms;Antineoplastic Agents;Biochemical;Biological Markers;Biometry;Cancer Institute of New Jersey;Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program;Clinical;Clinical Informatics;Clinical Investigator;Clinical Research;Clinical Trials;Clinical Trials Database;Comprehensive Cancer Center;DNA;Development;Documentation;Dose;Drug Delivery Systems;Drug Kinetics;Electronics;Goals;Grant;Human;Immunologics;Institution;Malignant Neoplasms;Microtubules;Monitor;New Jersey;Online Systems;Patients;Pharmacodynamics;Pharmacy facility;Phase;Population;Population Density;Research;Research Infrastructure;Research Personnel;Resource Sharing;Resources;Retrieval;Schedule;Services;Signal Pathway;System;Time;Tissues;Training and Education;United States;Validation;Visit;electronic data sharing;novel;pilot trial;research clinical testing;response;translational clinical trial,Robert S.

1R21CA083232-01A1,R21CA083232,6130434,2000,APTAMER BASED DETECTOR TO QUANTIFY MACROMOLECULES,"DESCRIPTION: (Applicant's Description) We propose to develop a technology to simultaneously detect and quantify large numbers individual proteins and post-translationally modified proteins. This technology will be based on a spatially-arrayed aptamer microchip and sensitive fluorescence-based optical detection techniques. The system will provide a powerful new tool for biomedical research and diagnosis of diseases and cancers. Currently, the levels of cellular proteins are inferred from cellular mRNA levels by using DNA oligonucleotide microchips. These microchips allow the detection of mRNA levels by base-pairing interactions to homologous DNA oligomers located at different sites in the microchip array. However, this indirect assay of protein levels suffers from two problems: First, mRNA levels may not accurately reflect the level of encoded protein because translation and degradation rates vary from protein to protein and are regulated in response to cell physiology. Second, post-translational modifications proteins often alter critical protein activities. This technology we propose to develop is comprised of three parts: 1) Aptamers with high-affinity and high-specifity for individual proteins. These aptamers will be designed to have ligand-dependent changes in fluorescence properties. 2) A microchip array with each array site occupied by aptamers against a different target molecule. 3) An evanescent field fluorescence detector which detects target molecules binding to aptamers at the array sites. Our proposal includes plans for: 1) selection of aptamers that can discriminate between different post-translational modifications of the same protein; 2) development of fluorescence-based techniques for detecting oligonucleotide:protein interactions; 3) design and construction of an optimized fluorescence detector; 4) scaling up methods to allow large numbers of independent aptamer selections against different proteins; 5) construction of a prototype protein chip.",macromolecule; messenger RNA; microprocessor /microchip; oligonucleotides; posttranslational modifications; proteins; technology /technique development,Martin J Stanton,Daniel L.

1R21CA112149-01,R21CA112149,6861456,2005,Automated Cell Preparation in Tubes for 3D Microscopy,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): 3D microscopy represents a powerful new cell analysis tool for early detection and diagnosis of cancer, but its future use may be limited because methods for preparation of samples are cumbersome, inefficient, labor intensive and generally imprecise. Current methods for cytological sample collection are manual and distributed in nature through various physicians' office laboratories and local hospitals, with the actual analysis being centralized at regional clinical laboratories. Among the cytological specimens are sputum, gynecological and colorectal scrapes, fine needle aspirates, urinary tract, and gastrointestinal samples. We propose the development of a new automated system that will transform these difficult and messy clinical specimens into an optimal format for 3D microscopy morphological and molecular analysis. The model and method we propose is comprised of three sequential steps. First, at the distributed site, an automated sample processor dissociates and fixes cells and debris for shipment in an automation compatible canister. Second, after shipment to a centralized clinical laboratory, the specimen canisters are loaded into an automatic processor that performs cleanup (debris removal), specimen/assay specific staining (and counterstaining), and finally embedding of cells of interest in glass microcapillary tubes (about 50 mu m ID), with cells being spaced at regular intervals (about 200 mu m) within a tube. This preparation format is uniquely suited for integration with multiple 3D imaging platforms for true 3D volumetric assessment of cell morphology and molecular probe and/or stain density distribution. The proposed system also enables use of cytometric flow sorting for enrichment of cells of interest at an intermediate stage of the sample preparation process. The potential impact to improved human health through rapid diagnostic screening will be illustrated using a high impact emerging technology, optical tomography. In summary, the aim of the proposed project is to develop, design, and build a complete sample processing system that automates the process of sample cleanup, assay specific staining, and mounting of cells into glass microcapillary tubes, and a tube positioning and rotation scanner mechanism for 3D microscopy analysis of cell morphology for the early detection of cancer.",bioimaging /biomedical imaging;biomedical automation;cell morphology;clinical research;cytodiagnosis;early diagnosis;flow cytometry;high throughput technology;human tissue;molecular probes;neoplasm /cancer diagnosis;technology /technique development;three dimensional imaging /topography;tissue /cell preparation,Deirdre R.

The assay proposed relies on an electro catalytic process involving two transition-metal ions that reports on biomolecular complexation events. Because the reporter system responds to changes in the electrostatics of an electrode surface, it will enable the analysis of nucleic acids/protein and peptide/protein complexes. The proposed project has 3 specific aims: 1) electro catalytic detection of DNA repair proteins implicated in cancer using DNA-modified electrodes; 2) optimization of electro catalytic detection and multiplexed analysis of cellular DNA repair activities, and 3) development of a generalized electro catalytic protein detection method using prostate cancer biomarkers. The electro catalytic protein detection system described is advantageous because it will allow the analysis and discrimination of multiprotein complexes in addition to uncomplexed analytes and will have high selectivity and specificity. Additionally, the protein detection assays will be conducted using nanoelectrodes that will allow multiplexed detection of panels of different biomolecular targets.",DNA binding protein;DNA repair;biomarker;biotechnology;carbonates;electrochemistry;electrodes;high throughput technology;nanotechnology;oligonucleotides;prostate neoplasms;prostate specific antigen;protein quantitation /detection;synthetic nucleotide;technology /technique development,Shana O Kelley,John R Knowlton,154500,154500,2005-06-21T12:06:00Z,2005-06-21T12:06:00Z,2007-05-31T12:05:00Z,RFA-CA-05-002,nofo_RFA-CA-05-002,BOSTON COLLEGE,chestnut hill,MA,UNITED STATES,imat,org_city,False
1R21CA114852-01,R21CA114852,6913103,2005,Profile serum proteins by glycopeptide capture and LC-MS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancers develop over a period of several years and they are characterized by molecular changes prior to invasion and metastasis. Development of a technology that enables screening of cancer from body fluids could permit cancer detection at early and treatable stages. It is expected that the composition of the serum proteome contains valuable information about the state of the human body in health and disease, and that this information can be extracted via quantitative proteomic measurements. Suitable proteomic techniques need to be sensitive, reproducible and robust, to detect potential biomarkers below the level of highly expressed proteins, to generate data sets that are comparable between experiments and laboratories, and have high throughput to support studies with sufficient statistical power. In this proposal, we will develop a method for high throughput quantitative analysis of serum proteins. It consists of the selective isolation of the peptides that are N-linked glycosylated in the intact protein using solid-phase extraction of glycopeptides (SPEG) on a robotic workstation, the analysis of these now de-glycosylated peptides by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS), and the comparative analysis of the resulting patterns. By focusing selectively on a few formerly N-linked glycopeptides per serum protein, the complexity of the analyte sample is significantly reduced, and the sensitivity, reproducibility, and throughput of serum proteome analysis are increased compared with the analysis of total tryptic peptides from unfractionated samples. We will explore the feasibility to identify cancer-specific serum proteins in the background of normal variation using a carcinogen-induced skin cancer mouse model. The specific aims are: 1) To develop chemistries and protocols for an automatic robotic system to isolate N-linked glycopeptides from serum in a high throughput and highly reproducible fashion; 2) To develop efficient and reproducible procedures for LC-MS analyses, and sequence identification of discriminatory peptides by tandem mass spectrometry; 3) To explore the feasibility of this method for the identification of distinctive serum peptides specific to cancer-bearing mice in the background of normal variations. If successful, the proposed research could subsequently be used for profiling human serum samples from cancer patients and normal individuals to identify the cancer-associated proteins in serum. The identified biomarkers will open a new paradigm for performing screening and detection of human cancer at early stage and for clinical therapeutic management.",biomarker;biomedical automation;biotechnology;blood proteins;glycopeptides;high throughput technology;laboratory mouse;liquid chromatography mass spectrometry;neoplasm /cancer diagnosis;proteomics;technology /technique development,Hui Zhang,John R Knowlton,167650,167650,2005-06-13T12:06:00Z,2005-06-13T12:06:00Z,2007-05-31T12:05:00Z,RFA-CA-05-002,nofo_RFA-CA-05-002,INSTITUTE FOR SYSTEMS BIOLOGY,seattle,WA,UNITED STATES,imat,org_city,False
1R21CA116060-01,R21CA116060,6962117,2005,REVERSIBLE PROMOTER-INSERTION FOR IN VIVO STUDIES OF MELANOMA,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is commonly accepted that the processes underlying the development of cancer are best modeled in vivo. A plethora of methods have been developed for genetic dissection of biological processes in somatic cells in culture; however, the adaptation of these techniques to in vivo use has been very limited. Our earlier experience indicates that reversible promoter-insertion mutagenesis offers a number of advantages over the currently used forward genetics techniques for cultured cells. The most important benefits are the dominant nature of the mutations, and the ease of identifying the affected gene and establishing the causal link between the mutation and the phenotype. The principal limitation for the adaptation of this technique to in vivo studies is the delivery of the insertional mutagen (typically, a retroviral vector) to the desired cell type. Based on our recent experience and published data from others, we propose a method to circumvent this limitation via the use of specially engineered transposon vectors. We propose to apply our technique to study the genetic events underlying melanoma development. We will screen for genetic events that cooperate with oncogenic Ras (commonly found in melanomas) in this process. We will confirm the properties of the proposed insertional mutagens in culture and then proceed to establish mouse strains suitable for mutagenesis. Upon verifying the properties of our constructs in vivo, we will selectively mutagenize melanocytes in transgenic animals and will test the functional link between tumorigenesis and the inserted promoter. Confirmed hits will be the subject of future investigation, while the technique itself will become available for dissection of various biological phenomena in general and aspects of tumorigenesis, in particular.",biomarker;biotechnology;cell line;gene mutation;genetically modified animals;guanine nucleotide binding protein;laboratory mouse;melanocyte;melanoma;neoplasm /cancer genetics;oncogenes;technology /technique development;tetracyclines;tissue /cell culture;transfection /expression vector;transposon /insertion element,Eugene S Kandel,Jennifer A.

1R21CA118632-01A2,R21CA118632,7238922,2007,Defining the Multiple Myeloma Kinome,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gene profiling technology has enabled analysis of the transcriptome and proteome of tumor cells. This information has provided useful information with regard to molecular mechanisms that define the enhanced survival and proliferation of MM cells. However, an equally, if not more important, goal is to define those proteins that participate in signaling pathways active in MM cells and their supporting stroma. Enzymes that phosphorylate tyrosine, serins and threonine residues on other proteins play a major role in signaling cascades that determine cell cycle entry and survival in MM and the stromal cells that support them. In particular, knowing the signaling pathways that are active in MM cells and their supporting stroma will provide critical information for understanding MM cell survival in the BM. We have developed and are applying to purified cells a novel array-based strategy that allows the simultaneous detection of phosphorylation for 1152 different kinase substrates. Here we propose to apply this emerging technology to the analysis of phosphorylation-based cell signaling pathways in MM and their supporting stroma. This R21/R33 Phased Innovation application will be pursued in two phases. In the R21 phase of this application Aims 1 and 2 will validate that PepChip technology can be applied to MM cells and their microenvironment to reveal signaling alterations in MM. In Aim 3 of the R33 phase we will use PepChip technology to identify kinome alterations within the MM patient population that are correlated with clinical parameters such as relapse and chromosomal abnormalities associated with poor prognosis. In Aim 4 we will utilize an in vivo model that supports the growth of primary patient isolates in RAG2XGammaC mice to determine the effect of therapeutics on the kinome of MM cells.

1R21CA123018-01,R21CA123018,7136805,2006,Epigenetic Targeting in Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hypermethylation of promoter CpG islands plays a prominent role in cancer. In partnership with alterations in histone acetylation/methylation, this epigenetic event establishes a repressive chromatin structure that leads to silencing of key cancer-related genes. The occurrence of DNA methylation within the genome is not random, but rather patterns of methylation are generated that are gene and tumor type specific. How DNA methylation patterns are established is still poorly understood. Since various transcriptional factors or regulators are found in association with DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) in vivo, we hypothesize that: 1) Oncogenic transcription factors can recruit DNMTs to target gene promoters and define a unique epigenetic signature in tumor cells; 2) Dissecting such complex epigenetic hierarchy will identify novel molecular targets for diagnosis, prognosis and therapeutic intervention. To test our hypothesis, we developed a high throughput technique for genome wide analysis of DNA methylation associated with specific proteins such as histones, transcription factors or any DNA binding proteins. The new approach named ChlP-Chop-DMH will combine both genome wide location analysis (also known as ChlP-on-Chip) and Differential Methylation Hybridization (DMH) analysis, two emerging technologies used in epigenetic research. The proposed method has distinct advantages over current protocols: first, this method directly examines the in vivo interaction of specific proteins with methylated DNA throughout the genome; second, this method may uncover novel biological properties of transcription factors; third, this method can be applied to discover novel epigenetic biomarkers relevant to tumorigenesis. In preliminary studies, we have verified the utility of this method with methylated histone H3 at lysine 9 and lysine 4 in human cancer cells. In the R21 phase, we will continue minor refinement of the method and pursue three aims: 1) Improve and optimize the ChlP-Chop-DMH method for analyzing genome wide association of DNA methylation with histone modification; 2) Utilize the proposed method to investigate the association of DNA methylation with chromatin remodeling factors: 3) Show proof-of-concept using the array to examine primary non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHLs). In this development phase we will focus on the sensitivity, reproducibility and accuracy of the proposed method. In the R33 phase, our goal is to utilize the technology to test biological hypotheses. We will fully implement the method and pursue these aims: 1) Discover epigenetic target genes associated with known oncogenic transcription factors c-Myc and BCL6: 2) Validate the identified epigenetic targets and investigate the regulatory role of the associated oncogenic transcription factors.

1R21CA125285-01,R21CA125285,7192889,2007,Transfected cell arrays for cancer research,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A major challenge in cancer biology is to understand how genotypic abnormalities or mutations will alter cellular responses, such as cell cycle regulation and drug resistance, involved in cancer progression. Our long-term goal is to investigate the early events in cancer progression and how they impact clinical outcome from the perspective of transcription factor (TF) activity, which relates to the activity of the signaling pathways. We hypothesize that cell-based assays that report on the activity of various signaling pathways within the cancer cells will link genotype to phenotype. The objective of this proposal is to develop a transfected cell array for high throughput analysis of TF activity in cancer cells, with breast cancer serving as a model. Our hypothesis and proposed research are based on the following observations: a) cDNA or protein microarrays cannot predict cellular activity, as activity is based on a specific protein conformation or state and cellular localization, b) cell-based assays provide the physiological context in which to examine cellular activity, c) TF activity is widely used to measure cellular activity using a two-plasmid system: one measures the activity of a specific TF and the second normalizes for the transfection efficiency: Based on these observations, the experimental objectives of the proposal are to develop a high throughput system to quantify activity of many TFs. The specific aims of the proposal are: Specific Aim 1: Create a transfected cell array with 100 spots capable of localized, efficient transfection of breast cancer cell lines. We will a) develop the procedures to deposit lipoplexes in spots while retaining their bioactivity and b) quantify the percentage of transfected cells and transgene expression in the spot. Specific Aim 2: Validate the transfected cell array for quantifying TF activity by a) determining ratio of the two plasmids and positional consistency between array spots and b) quantifying TF activity non-invasively using an imaging technique that enables following the TF activity over time. Specific Aim 3: Compare the TF activity for cells differing by one or more genotypic mutations. We will characterize TF activity for a) mammary epithelial cells immortalized by TERT (76NTERT) or by mutant p53 (76Ndel239) and b) primary tumor and malignant tumor cells, which were established from the same patient.

1R21CA125398-01A1,R21CA125398,7291241,2007,The Kinomes of Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gene profiling technology has enabled analysis of the transcriptome and proteome of tumor cells. In fact, massively parallel analysis of the Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) transcriptome has revealed discrete gene profile signatures for the major subtypes of NHL, diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and follicular lymphoma (FL). This information has provided useful insights into molecular mechanisms that promote enhanced survival and proliferation in NHL. However, an equally, if not more important goal, is to define those proteins that participate in signaling pathways active in lymphoma cells and non-malignant cells that infiltrate these tumors. Enzymes that phosphorylate tyrosine, serine and threonine residues on other proteins play a major role in signaling cascades that control cell cycle entry, survival, angiogenesis and the immune response. Defining how these signaling pathways are altered in NHL B cells and non- malignant cells present in these tumors will provide critical information for understanding how lymphoma survives, proliferates and interacts with other cells at the tumor site. We are applying to purified tumor cells a novel array strategy that allows the simultaneous detection of phosphorylation for 1152 different kinase substrates. Here we propose to apply this emerging technology to the analysis of phosphorylation-based cell signaling pathways in NHL. This proposal will be pursued in two phases. The R21 phase will consist of two aims that will validate PepChip technology can identify kinome alterations in primary DLBCL (Aim 1) and FL (Aim 2) isolates. The R33 phase will consist of two aims that will define kinome alterations in DLBCL (Aim 3) and FL (Aim 4) that correlate with clinical parameters. In Aim 5 we will utilize in vivo models of FL and DLBCL to determine whether inhibitors specific for deregulated kinases inhibit growth of NHL tumors in immunodeficient mice. This study will be pursued in the following phased R21/R33 format: R21 Phase: Aim 1: Define the kinome of DLBCL B cells and non-malignant cells present in these tumors.

1R21CA132806-01,R21CA132806,7434635,2008,Standardized NanoArray PCR for Gene Expression Profiling of Lung Cancer,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Molecular characterization of cancer, in particular by gene transcription profiling, has great potential to improve prognosis, therapeutic selection and clinical outcomes. However, the potential for using expression signatures for cancer prognosis and treatment selection is hampered by lack of readily deployable test kits with the accuracy, low RNA requirement and inter-site concordance required for routine clinical use. We propose an innovative solution based on two well-validated PCR technologies whose combination uniquely addresses the problem of diagnostic assay reproducibility. Our plan is to implement Standardized RT (StaRT)-PCR, a proven competitive PCR method developed at the University of Toledo, in a novel nanofluidic PCR platform developed by BioTrove Inc. in order to streamline the fluidic workflow, improve measurement throughput, and at the same time reduce test cost and maintain low RNA input. As compared to existing hybridization or real-time qPCR approaches, Standardized NanoArray PCR (SNAP) will provide the same dynamic range and quality as RT-PCR, yet require less RNA input and be more readily clinically deployable. The development will entail step-wise integration of proven technologies. First, real-time qPCR TaqMan assays will be developed for 16 lung tumor prognostic genes. These assays will be converted to StaRT-PCR by creation of competitive template and a competitor specific dye-labeled probe. Adding a pre-amplification step to StaRT-PCR will reduce the RNA input requirements to enable thousands of tests per sample. Finally, moving the assays into the OpenArray nano-PCR plate will streamline fluid handling. Using RNA isolated from lung clinical tumor resections, dynamic range and precision equivalent to real-time qPCR will be demonstrated for the integrated platform. After the initial development phase is complete, we will compare SNAP and real time qPCR in two critical gene expression profiling experiments. First we will compare the minimum amount of RNA required for each method by monitoring loss of precision as a function of decreasing RNA sample input. Second we will demonstrate lower inter-site variability, a critical factor for deploy-ability, by measuring gene expression profiles of seven lung tumor resection samples in three laboratories. Meeting these Specific Aims will lead to seeking further funding for multi-site prognostic validation studies involving formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) lung specimens with extensive clinical history.",Address;Adoption;Biological Assay;Cancer Prognosis;Characteristics;Chemistry;Class;Clinical;Color;Consumption;Detection;Development;Diagnostic;Diagnostic Procedure;Diagnostic tests;Dyes;End Point;End Point Assay;Excision;Formalin;Freezing;Funding;Gene Expression;Gene Expression Profile;Gene Expression Profiling;Genes;Genetic Transcription;Genomics;Goals;Health;Label;Laboratories;Lead;Liquid substance;Lung;Lung Neoplasms;Malignant Neoplasms;Malignant neoplasm of lung;Measurement;Measures;Methods;Molecular;Molecular Diagnostic Testing;Molecular Profiling;Monitor;Morphologic artifacts;Nanoarray Analytical Device;Numbers;Operative Surgical Procedures;Outcome;Paraffin Embedding;Performance;Phase;Pliability;Polymerase Chain Reaction;Quality Control;RNA;Range;Recording of previous events;Reproducibility;Running;Sampling;Selection for Treatments;Site;Solutions;Specimen;Speed;Staging;Standards of Weights and Measures;System;Taq Polymerase;Technology;Testing;Therapeutic;Time;Universities;Validation;base;cost;design;improved;inhibitor/antagonist;innovation;malignant breast neoplasm;nano;nanofluidic;neoplastic;novel;nuclease;outcome forecast;prognostic;research study;tumor;validation studies,Tony E Godfrey; Tom B Morrison; James C.

1R21CA177395-01A1,R21CA177395,8664139,2014,A novel single-molecule telomere characterization technology for analyzing cancer,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Single-telomere-specific (TTAGGG)n tract lengths and instabilities cannot be measured globally using current methods; the ability to do so would be a major, transformative addition to the arsenal of tools for analyzing critical telomere loss an telomere elongation events in cancer. The shortest telomere or a small subset of the shortest telomeres in a cell will determine the onset of senescence, apoptosis, or genome instability; single (TTAGGG)n tracts are crucial for the function of telomeres and the biological effects of telomere attrition and dysfunction. Telomere loss, breakage, fusion, and rejoining are highly elevated in cancer, but current methods for detecting and measuring these mutational events at the molecular level are limited and low-throughput. The technology we propose to develop here would permit quantitative, single- allele-resolution measurements of telomere length and instability, enabling unprecedented insights into the role(s) telomere loss, telomere breakage/re-joining, and telomerase or ALT dependent telomere elongation play in carcinogenesis, including mechanistic insights into molecular events mediating these processes and translational insights for the potential prognostic and tumor stratification applicability of the methods. In this method, input genomic DNA is labeled with fluorescent dyes specific for (TTAGGG)n sequences and for linked subtelomeric DNA. The labeled individual DNA fragments are linearized (stretched) and imaged in the nano-channels of Bionano Genomics system at very high throughput. The lengths of the telomere are measured accurately and the distances between probes in the subtelomere region are determined accurately to infer the identity of the telomere. Our goals for this R21 study are to establish feasibility for (1) high-throughput single-molecule detection and quantitation of (TTAGGG)n tracts in genomic DNA samples and (2) subtelomere probe development and efficient co-labeling of telomeres and subtelomeres in the context of total genomic DNA, including conversion of the labeled DNA to double- stranded DNA suitable for nano-channel analysis; and (3) proof-of-principle results for the technology and its applicability for cancer research using data generated and analyzed for a normal and a cancer cell line. There are significant technical challenges inherent in this early-stage technology development project, but the extraordinary payoff for cancer research will be a high-throughput ability to probe mechanisms of telomere length regulation and telomere mutation at single-telomere resolution, in small (ultimately single-cell) samples of both dividing and non-dividing cells.",Alleles;Apoptosis;Bar Codes;Base Pairing;Biological;Biological Assay;Biology;Cancer cell line;Cells;Chromosomes;Collection;DNA;Data;Detection;Development;Diploidy;Event;Fibroblasts;Fluorescent Dyes;Functional disorder;Genome;Genomic DNA;Genomic Instability;Genomics;Goals;Human;Image;Individual;Interphase Cell;Label;Length;Link;Maintenance;Malignant Neoplasms;Measurement;Measures;Mediating;Methods;Miniaturization;Molecular;Mutation;Neoplasm Circulating Cells;Pattern;Performance;Play;Population;Process;Regulation;Resolution;Role;Sampling;Scheme;Signal Transduction;Site;Sorting - Cell Movement;Specificity;Staging;Stratification;Stretching;System;Technology;Telomerase;Testing;Time;anticancer research;base;cancer cell;cancer genome;cancer stem cell;carcinogenesis;design;ds-DNA;high throughput analysis;insight;nanochannel;neoplastic cell;novel;prognostic;public health relevance;research study;senescence;single molecule;technology development;telomere;tool;tumor,Harold Riethman; Ming Xiao,Jerry Li,304593,304593,2014-05-13T12:05:00Z,2014-05-13T12:05:00Z,2017-04-30T12:04:00Z,RFA-CA-13-001,nofo_RFA-CA-13-001,WISTAR INSTITUTE,philadelphia,PA,UNITED STATES,imat,org_city,True
1R21CA191186-01,R21CA191186,8810908,2015,Droplet Microfluidic Platform for Ultralow Input Epigenetics,"﻿ DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epigenomic analyses are playing increasingly prominent roles in the development of personalized strategies for treating cancer. However, the translation of fundamental epigenomic insight to the clinic is wrought with challenges. Take for example the study of post-translational histone protein modifications, which can serve to either promote or repress the transcription of pendant DNA sequences. Analyses of these critically important interactions bridge genomics and proteomics and present significant challenges in the clinical setting. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) is the method of choice for analyzing protein-DNA interactions and the basic method involves fragmentation of chromatin, separation of modified proteins using antibodies and magnetic beads, and subsequent analysis of the associated DNA by qPCR or sequencing. While sounding simple, a typical ChIP workflow involves ~30 steps, takes 4+ days, and requires 106-107 cells as input. These requirements significantly limit the applicability of ChIP in a clinical setting-particularly when minimal sampl is available, such as in the analysis of tumor biopsies, stem cells, or circulating tumor cells. Microfluidic devices offer many attractive benefits over traditional macro-scale methods including reduced volume requirements, parallelization capability, and automated operation, which make them particularly well- suited to sample-constrained epigenetic analyses. A handful of recent reports suggest a substantial opportunity for microfluidically-enabled ChIP analyses; however, there is still considerable room for further improvement. We propose to develop a powerful and versatile, droplet microfluidics-based, nanoliter-scale Chromatin ImmunoCapture (nChIC) platform suitable for individualized medicine applications. Droplet microfluidics offer several benefits, including rapid, controlled, and efficient fluid handling, and the capacity to handle variable sample sizes, since devices can accommodate larger samples by simply operating for longer periods of time. Our nChIC platform will incorporate every major step in the ChIP workflow into an automated device, including cell lysis, chromatin digestion, immunocapture, and DNA purification. Importantly, these processes will be carried out at the single cell level, which promises to provide unique insights into epigenomic tumor heterogeneity. Beyond single cells, the unprecedented ability to handle samples of variable input will also facilitate robust validation against traditional ChIP assays to demonstrate broad genomic coverage. Taken together, we feel that the nChIC platform will be a powerful new tool that enables the translation of epigenomic insight into individualized cancer treatment at the point of care.",Address;Aging;Antibodies;Automation;Basic Science;Benchmarking;Biological Assay;Biopsy;Cancer Biology;Cell Nucleus;Cells;Chromatin;Clinic;Clinical;Complex;Cytolysis;DNA;DNA Modification Process;DNA Repair;DNA Sequence;DNA analysis;DNA biosynthesis;DNA purification;DNA-Protein Interaction;Development;Device Designs;Devices;Digestion;Dinucleosome;Encapsulated;Epigenetic Process;Genetic Transcription;Genome;Genomics;Goals;Gold;Heterogeneity;Histones;Liquid substance;Malignant Neoplasms;Methods;Microfluidic Microchips;Microfluidics;Molecular Target;Mono-S;Neoplasm Circulating Cells;Non-Histone Chromosomal Proteins;Nucleosomes;Oils;Phase;Play;Population;Post-Translational Protein Processing;Preparation;Process;Proteins;Proteomics;Protocols documentation;Publishing;Recovery;Reporting;Research;Resolution;Role;Sample Size;Sampling;Side;Signal Transduction;Stem cells;Technology;Testing;Time;Touch sensation;Translational Research;Translations;Untranslated RNA;Validation;Variant;Writing;aqueous;base;cancer diagnosis;cancer stem cell;cancer therapy;carcinogenesis;cell fate specification;chromatin immunoprecipitation;cost effective;epigenomics;genome-wide;histone modification;individualized medicine;insight;magnetic beads;nanolitre scale;operation;personalized cancer therapy;point of care;protein complex;public health relevance;skills;sound;synthetic construct;technology development;tool;transcription factor;treatment strategy;tumor,Ryan C Bailey; Tamas Ordog,Rao L Divi,205437,205437,2015-02-16T12:02:00Z,2015-02-16T12:02:00Z,2018-01-31T12:01:00Z,RFA-CA-14-003,nofo_RFA-CA-14-003,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,champaign,IL,UNITED STATES,imat,org_city,False
1R21CA193064-01,R21CA193064,8851376,2015,Cellular biofactories for therapeutic protein synthesis in tumor microenvironment,"﻿ DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): T cells undergo an intelligent decision-making process based on the inhibitory and excitatory chemotactic inputs; and extravagate to the tumor microenvironment through solid tissue barriers. Investigators' long-term goal, to be pursued in R33 phase, is to develop T cells into a platform vector technology for active drug- transport to the solid tumors. In this R21 application, their objective is to engineer a robust mechanism to transform autologous T cells into biofactories for autonomous synthesis of cytocidal secretory proteins upon stimulation by the tumor cells. Autonomous synthesis of Protein-of-Interest (PoI) with spatiotemporal resolution will enable targeting of tumor burden with cellular resolution and molecular specificity. Their central hypothesis is that T cells can be genetically encoded for robust modulation and biosynthesis of therapeutic proteins at the tumor site. They have chosen ovarian cancer that expresses Folate Receptor alpha (FRa) as disease model, and an apoptotic protein for its cytotoxic therapeutic value. However, the rationale for developing T cells as protein biofactories is that this is a platform technology and their specificity can be modified to target any cancer and autonomously synthesize any PoI in situ. To aid this R21 effort, they have developed cell lines expressing bioluminescent and fluorescent reporters expressed only when stimulated by tumor cells. With following specific aims, they will advance this project towards its goals: (1) To develop robust control on biosynthesis of protein-of-interest (PoI); (2) To develop T cells as biofactories for autonomous secretion of antitumor apoptotic protein. It is expected that this R21 phase will lead to T cells that will not activate in healthy tissues (enhanced safety) and hyperactivate specifically in the tumor microenvironment (enhanced efficacy). The impact of this research will also be felt on ongoing T-cell therapy trials by reducing the incidences of graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD). This pioneering approach builds upon ongoing T-cell immunotherapy trials, which are currently limited to control minimal residual disease (MRD) and is administered after chemotherapy. Proposed research is transformative, firstly because it will expand the scope of T-cell engineering to replace systemic chemotherapies. This will then be used for reduction of tumor burden rather than keeping MRD in check. Secondly, therapeutic proteins of non-human origin are efficiently degraded and removed by the immune system. This is a barrier to their in vivo application. The use of autologous T cells for biosynthesis of therapeutic proteins at the target site will eliminate any immunogenicity issues. Unusually high impact is expected because the specificity of T cells can be redirected towards the surface markers on different cancers and therefore be used to target multitude of cancers.",Address;Amidohydrolases;Anabolism;Antigen Targeting;Antigens;Apoptotic;Autologous;Cell Line;Cytoplasm;Decision Making;Development;Disease model;Drug Delivery Systems;Drug Transport;Engineering;Foundations;Future;Goals;IL6 gene;Immune system;Immunosuppressive Agents;Immunotherapy;In Situ;Incidence;Injection of therapeutic agent;Intercellular Fluid;Lead;Malignant Neoplasms;Malignant neoplasm of ovary;Mission;Molecular;Penicillin G;Permeability;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phase;Process;Prodrugs;Protein Biosynthesis;Proteins;Public Health;Regulation;Reporter;Reporting;Research;Research Personnel;Residual Neoplasm;Resolution;Response Elements;Safety;Site;Solid;Solid Neoplasm;Specificity;Surface;System;T cell response;T cell therapy;T-Cell Development;T-Cell Immunologic Specificity;T-Lymphocyte;Technology;Therapeutic;Therapy trial;Tissues;Transgenes;Tumor Antigens;Tumor Burden;Work;amidase;base;cellular engineering;chemotherapy;chimeric antigen receptor;cytotoxic;graft vs host disease;human FOLR1 protein;immunogenicity;in vivo;interest;nanoparticle;neoplastic cell;nuclear factors of activated T-cells;pressure;prevent;promoter;public health relevance;secretory protein;spatiotemporal;success;therapeutic protein;tumor;tumor microenvironment;tumor specificity;vector,Parijat Bhatnagar,Tawnya C Mckee,1,1,2015-05-19T12:05:00Z,2015-06-01T12:06:00Z,2015-06-02T12:06:00Z,RFA-CA-14-003,nofo_RFA-CA-14-003,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,houston,TX,UNITED STATES,imat,org_city,False
1R21CA196418-01,R21CA196418,8928922,2015,"Multiplexed, Quantitative Fluorescence Imaging in Tumor Sections","﻿ DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Precision medicine for cancer requires knowledge of the driver mutations in a particular patient's tumor. Recent single cell genetic studies have shown that driver mutations and cancer cell subtype are highly heterogeneous within a single patient. Thus, clinicians will need to employ experimental methods that allow observation of a variety of molecular analytes across many individual cells within a particular patient's tumor section in situ. Current tumor section analyses are not highly multiplexed and typically remain limited to ~4-5 analytes, or 7 with multi-spectral imaging. Recent technologies have pushed this number into 30s-60s, but they require expensive equipment and/or reagents, sophisticated analyses or markedly increased assay time, all of which would preclude their practical use in many clinical pathology and preclinical research laboratories. Thus, there remains a significant need for technologies that multiplex measurements in tumor sections but are widely accessible and cost-effective. We focus on addressing this need with a readily-adoptable but novel multi- spectral fluorescence-based method. It is based on the hypothesis that the power of combinatorics can be harnessed to vastly increase the number of quantifiable analytes in a mixture by permuting the wide array of available fluorophores in new ways. We term our approach combinatorial fluorescence with spectral imaging (CoFSI). CoFSI only requires the ability to perform multi-channel fluorescence excitation and emission spectral scanning, which is widely available and easy to implement in most plate/slide readers and many microscopes. Data analysis involves a straightforward, fast computational technique called linear unmixing. Preliminary simulation studies suggest that the concentrations of 123 different CoFSI probes constructed from 16 existing fluorescent proteins can be estimated simultaneously with good accuracy and precision across 3 orders of concentration magnitude with a large number of excitation channels, and 48 probes with 6 excitation channels. Similar simulation studies constrained by available tumor section imaging equipment and Alexa dyes suggest 25 simultaneous measurements are possible. Initial pilot experiments demonstrate that seven different CoFSI probe levels in a mixture can be measured both accurately and precisely using only the blue-yellow part of the spectrum. This proposal further tests the limits of CoFSI experimentally, and applies CoFSI to tumor section imaging, with two Aims: (1) Quantify the Levels of 48 Fluorescent Probes in a Mixture Simultaneously; and (2) Quantify the Spatial Distribution of 25 Analytes in Tumor Sections. If successful, CoFSI can increase quantitative fluorescence multiplexing at least ~5 to 10-fold while relying on standard lab resources and straightforward analyses. CoFSI is also feasibly compatible with other difficult-to-multiplex technologies such as high content screening, live-cell imaging, and in vivo rodent imaging, and thus may have broad impact.",Address;Antibodies;Antigens;Architecture;Area;Basic Science;Binding;Biological Assay;Biological Markers;Biopsy Specimen;Breast Cancer cell line;Cells;Chemicals;Classification;Clinic;Clinical Data;Clinical Pathology;Combinatorics;Computational Technique;Cytometry;Data;Data Analyses;Diagnostic;Dyes;Epitopes;Equipment;Escherichia coli;Fluorescence;Fluorescent Probes;Genetic study;Heterogeneity;Image;In Situ;In Situ Hybridization;Individual;Knowledge;Label;Laboratories;Life;Malignant Neoplasms;Measurement;Measures;Methods;Microscope;Molecular;Mus;Mutation;Nucleic Acids;Oncologist;Patients;Pharmacologic Substance;Principal Investigator;Proteins;Reader;Reagent;Research;Resolution;Resources;Rodent;Sample Size;Sampling;Scanning;Science;Slide;Solutions;Spatial Distribution;Staining method;Stains;System;Techniques;Technology;Testing;Time;Tissues;Translating;Writing;Xenograft procedure;Yeasts;base;cancer cell;cell type;cellular imaging;clinical decision-making;clinically relevant;combinatorial;cost effective;data acquisition;deep sequencing;drug development;fluorescence imaging;fluorophore;imaging modality;imaging probe;improved;in vivo;insight;malignant breast neoplasm;novel;optical spectra;outcome forecast;pre-clinical;pre-clinical research;precision medicine;public health relevance;research and development;research study;screening;simulation;spectrograph;treatment response;tumor;tumor microenvironment;tumor xenograft,Marc R.

1R21CA202831-01,R21CA202831,9036024,2016,Novel Bi-functional Inhibitors Blocking OncomiR Biogenesis,"﻿ DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this proposal is to develop a new class of selective miRNA regulators that blocks the maturation of oncomiRs. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate diverse biological processes. Dysregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) has become one of the emerging mechanisms contributes to cancer formation and progression. Increasing evidences suggest that certain miRNAs affect cellular transformation, carcinogenesis and metastasis, and act as oncogenes (oncogenic miRNAs or oncomiRs). Understanding the roles of oncomiRs in cancer will lead to the development of new cancer therapies. Besides, direct therapeutic intervention of oncomiRs has become a promising new direction for treating cancer. For both research and therapeutic purposes, methods allowing the control of oncomiR levels are highly desirable. Current methods for such purposes generally suffer from the off-target inhibition. To address this critical issue, we propose a novel strategy to regulate miRNA. We will develop a new class of bi-functional miRNA regulators consisting of independent and specialized ""pre-miRNA recognition unit"" and ""Dicer inhibition unit"" to target unique pre- miRNAs and block their processing to generate mature miRNAs by inhibiting Dicer enzymatic activity. The following Aims will accomplish our goal of establishing this new strategy: Aim 1. Synthesize and test bi- functional miRNA regulators. We will synthesize bi-functional regulators for miRNA-21 (miR-21) and other oncomiRs and test their inhibitory activity. Aim 2: Test the activity and specificity of the bi-functional miRNA regulator in cells. We will optimize cellular uptake of the regulator in mammalian cells. The cellular activity and off-target effects of the regulator will be evaluated in cells. This work will establish the technical foundation of a novel oncomiR regulation strategy. This unique technology will address the major obstacle encountered in current miRNA regulating methods and enhance the capability to dissect the roles of oncomiRs in cancer biology. It will significantly contribute to the advancement in our knowledge of the role played by oncomiRs in cancer and will result in the development of novel cancer therapies either directly based on the bi- modular regulators or evolved from the understanding of oncomiR functions unveiled by this new technology.",Address;Adverse effects;Affect;Affinity;Antisense Oligonucleotides;Binding;Biogenesis;Biological Assay;Biological Process;Cancer Biology;Cell physiology;Cells;Development;Dicer Enzyme;Foundations;Generations;Goals;In Vitro;Knowledge;Lead;Link;Malignant Neoplasms;Mammalian Cell;Messenger RNA;Methods;MicroRNAs;Neoplasm Metastasis;Northern Blotting;Oncogenes;Oncogenic;Pathogenesis;Play;Process;Proteins;RNA;Regulation;Research;Role;Specificity;Technology;Testing;Therapeutic Human Experimentation;Therapeutic Intervention;Untranslated RNA;Western Blotting;Work;base;cancer therapy;cancer type;carcinogenesis;design;improved;inhibitor/antagonist;interest;metaplastic cell transformation;new technology;next generation;novel;novel strategies;novel therapeutics;public health relevance;research and development;ribosome profiling;transcriptome sequencing;uptake,Fu-Sen Liang,John R Knowlton,185078,185078,2016-04-07T12:04:00Z,2016-05-01T12:05:00Z,2019-04-30T12:04:00Z,RFA-CA-15-002,nofo_RFA-CA-15-002,UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO,albuquerque,NM,UNITED STATES,imat,org_city,False

Ty- rosine phosphorylation often becomes dysregulated in cancer and therefore, understanding the effect of phos- phorylation on protein function will be paramount to identifying therapeutic interventions in cancer. Unfortunately, an important tool in the basic research of phosphorylation – testing the effect of protein phosphorylation by com- paring the function of the phosphorylated form with an unphosphorylated form of the protein in in vitro assays – is signiﬁcantly hindered by our limited knowledge in how to make a phosphorylated protein. This project seeks to build a molecular technology, inspired by previous observations of biochemistry in cell networks, to overcome this requirement and improve the pace of basic research. The goal of this research is to build a fast, accessible and inexpensive method for producing phosphorylated and soluble proteins in a bacterial system. The goals will be achieved by: development of a molecular toolkit for the enhancement and control of precise phosphorylation on protein substrates using secondary kinase-substrate targeting approaches, testing the toolkit on a set of sub- strates, and comparing the outcome with current technologies. It is anticipated that this technology will be less expensive, more physiologically-relevant, and capable of producing a larger variety of phosphorylated forms of proteins than current molecular approaches to studying the effect of protein phosphorylation.",Amino Acid Sequence;Automobile Driving;Basic Cancer Research;Basic Science;Binding;Biochemical;Biochemistry;Biological;Biological Assay;Cells;Darkness;Development;Engineering;Escherichia coli;Glutamic Acid;Goals;Grant;Human;Kinetics;Knowledge;Libraries;Malignant Neoplasms;Mass Spectrum Analysis;Measurement;Measures;Methods;Molecular;Molecular Bank;Mutate;Outcome;Pattern;Phosphoproteins;Phosphorylation;Phosphotransferases;Phosphotyrosine;Physiological;Post-Translational Protein Processing;Process;Production;Property;Proteins;Proteome;Recombinant Proteins;Recombinants;Regulation;Research;Research Personnel;SH3 Domains;Signal Transduction;Specificity;Substrate Domain;Substrate Specificity;System;Technology;Testing;Therapeutic Intervention;Thick;Tyrosine;Tyrosine Phosphorylation;Work;base;improved;in vitro Assay;polyproline;protein function;src Homology Region 2 Domain;technology development;tool;vector,Kristen M Naegle,John R Knowlton,228750,228750,2017-08-16T12:08:00Z,2017-08-16T12:08:00Z,2020-07-31T12:07:00Z,RFA-CA-16-001,nofo_RFA-CA-16-001,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,saint louis,MO,UNITED STATES,imat,org_city,True
1R21CA229044-01,R21CA229044,9572744,2018,Novel platform linking cancer-specific glycosylation with cell signaling outcomes,ABSTRACT Abnormal glycosylation is a hallmark of many cancers that contributes to tumor growth and invasion. There are many protein receptors that are regulated abnormally in cancer due to mutations and/or alterations in glycosylation. Studies to link specific glycosylation changes to signaling outcomes have primarily focused on studies of individual receptors or specific pathways. Methods that can link forms of tumor-specific glycosylation to global effects on signaling pathway activation are needed to better identify potential new targets for therapeutics. To overcome this limitation we are employing the use of heterobifunctional molecule that will link cancer-specific glycosylation on protein receptors with a proximity- induced ubiquitination. To demonstrate the potential and applicability of this method we are using a novel scFv antibody that recognizes tumor-specific glycans present on ovarian cancer and glioblastoma cells that has been demonstrated to have excellent cell permeability. Combining the scFv with proteolysis targeting molecules will enable us to identify receptors and signaling changes using mass spectrometry methods.

1R21CA258013-01,R21CA258013,10174448,2021,Device for Preservation of Cell Free RNA in Saliva,"ABSTRACT Early detection is critical to cancer mortality reductions, and yet the breast imaging clinic visits required for these life-saving early detection programs are inaccessible to disadvantaged, remote, or quarantined populations with limited medical facility access. In fact, breast cancer surveillance programs this year have stalled by as much as 90% versus their pre-pandemic rates, resulting in risky delays in new cancer diagnosis [1]. A saliva-based test for early detection could transform today’s screening paradigms. A promising biofluid for disease detection, saliva can be self-sampled non-invasively, without trained technicians. Saliva is ideal for at-home and other non-clinical site collection; it contains a variety of analytes including exosomes, RNA, DNA, proteins, metabolites, viruses and oral microflora, and is a powerful window on health and disease. Recently, saliva samples have shown better clinical utility vs. nasal swabs for detecting COVID-19 [2]. Mounting evidence exists for oral microbiome links to systemic disease [3], and salivary biomarkers diagnose complex traits such as pediatric medical conditions, traumatic brain injury, autism, and cancer [4-7]. A commercial saliva-based test for autism is based on 32 human and microbial RNA markers [8]. In many complex trait studies, saliva is frozen as cell-free supernatant. The most prevalent saliva collection and preservation devices, although easy-to-use, preclude effective cell-free RNA and exosome analysis, since saliva samples are treated with lysis reagents resulting in mixed populations of cellular and non-cellular RNAs, increasing noise and damaging performance characteristics. Saliva collection devices that instead use membranes to separate cells suffer from inefficient recovery of critical analytes, either because they lack appropriate preservatives or because they adsorb and therefore lose, a substantial analyte fraction. To enable widespread use for disease detection, new standardized methods are needed to preserve cell-free saliva and retain the integrity of its key constituents for stable transport and downstream analysis. This project extends our past SBIR grant work and our own internal research, to develop an easy-to-use saliva collection and preservation device to stabilize cfRNA and other analytes, enabling us and others to efficiently collect high-quality clinical saliva samples. Using RT-qPCR assays and RNA isotype profiles, we will characterize salivary cfRNA integrity and stability over timelines sufficient for remote collection and transport. Armed with well-characterized RNA decay profiles, we propose an iterative design-of-experiment approach to prototype a versatile device to collect and preserve saliva at room temperature (RT), stabilizing RNA while also preventing cell lysis and bacterial growth. Our device performance validation will use prospectively collected and preserved saliva from >50 women to demonstrate stability for up 72 hours at ambient conditions. This device will standardize methods for collection, stability, and transport of saliva, key to driving virtualized sample collection and healthcare in cancer, viral, and other diagnostics, increasingly critical to a post-pandemic world.",Adoption;Automobile Driving;Biocide;Biological Assay;Biological Markers;Blood specimen;Breast Cancer Detection;COVID-19;COVID-19 detection;COVID-19 pandemic;Cells;Centrifugation;Characteristics;Childhood;Clinic;Clinic Visits;Clinical;Clinical Research;Collection;Complex;Cytolysis;DNA;Detection;Development;Devices;Diagnosis;Diagnostic;Diagnostic tests;Disadvantaged;Disease;Early Diagnosis;Facility Accesses;Feedback;Fractionation;Freezing;Future;Genomics;Grant;Growth;Health;Healthcare;Home;Hour;Human;Image;Individual;Laboratories;Life;Link;Malignant Neoplasms;Manuals;Measurement;Measures;Medical;Medicine;Membrane;Methods;Microbe;Mixed Cellular Population;Molecular;Monitor;Noise;Nucleic Acids;Office Visits;Participant;Patients;Performance;Phase;Population;Process;Property;Quarantine;RNA;RNA Decay;RNA Degradation;RNA Stability;RNA marker;Reagent;Recovery;Research;Saliva;Salivary;Sampling;Savings;Ships;Site;Small Business Innovation Research Grant;Standardization;Surveillance Program;Systemic disease;Temperature;Testing;TimeLine;Training;Traumatic Brain Injury;Validation;Venous blood sampling;Viral;Virus;Woman;Work;autism spectrum disorder;base;biomarker panel;breast imaging;cancer diagnosis;clinical diagnostics;cost;design;exosome;experimental study;innovation;iterative design;malignant breast neoplasm;microbial;microbiota;microorganism growth;mortality;nasal swab;next generation sequencing;nuclease;oral microbial community;oral microbiome;pandemic disease;participant enrollment;pathogen;point of care;preservation;prevent;programs;prospective;protein metabolite;prototype;saliva sample;salivary assay;salivary cell;sample collection;screening;trait;usability;virtual,Shivani Nautiyal,Karl E Krueger,232400,232400,2021-06-03T12:06:00Z,2021-06-03T12:06:00Z,2023-05-31T12:05:00Z,RFA-CA-20-019,nofo_RFA-CA-20-019,"PRIME GENOMICS, INC.",mountain view,CA,UNITED STATES,imat,org_city,False

Most women present with advanced stage disease with survival rates of roughly 20%. Advances in the field of proteomics now provide the tools necessary to effectively analyze the serum proteome, and the application of such technologies holds great promise for determining novel biomarkers. This proposal outlines methods to comprehensively discover, identify, quantify, and validate a panel of specific and sensitive ovarian cancer biomarkers for early detection. We propose the following Specific Aims: 1. Determine candidate ovarian cancer biomarkers defined by comprehensive biomarker analysis of serum. Emphasis will be placed on refining the most effective overall analytical strategy for comprehensive and reproducible measurements. Spectral peaks that most accurately distinguish cancer vs. control will be identified using high-resolving power technology. Biostatistics and bioinformatics will be used to prioritize candidate markers (according to specificity, sensitivity and predictive value) for further characterization. 2. Identification and absolute quantification of the candidate biomarkers. This will improve reliability and high-throughput capabilities in subsequent validation testing, and the identification of these proteins will contribute further to research into the biologic basis of the disease. We will use accurate mass measurements, tandem mass spectrometry, and non-redundant protein and genome databases applied to distinct selected controls. Furthermore, we will determine the range of values for both normal and cancer serum samples using stable isotope labeled internal standards. 3. Clinical validation of a panel of biomarkers in specific groups of women. Sera from defined cohorts of women will be used to accurately determine the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of individual and combinations of candidate markers in all aspects of disease (early/late stage, familial, remission and recurrence) and in large numbers of non-cancer controls.",biomarker;clinical research;early diagnosis;female;high throughput technology;human middle age (35-64);human old age (65+);human subject;interview;mass spectrometry;menopause;neoplasm /cancer classification /staging;neoplasm /cancer diagnosis;neoplasm /cancer epidemiology;neoplasm /cancer relapse /recurrence;ovary neoplasms;protein quantitation /detection;proteomics;serum;stable isotope;women&apos;s health,David C.

More recently, many have come to believe that some cancers might be detectable by ""signatures"", patterns of sets of molecules, perhaps normally present in the blood, but, in for certain cancers, present in higher or lower amounts than normal. Recently, we learned to make new kinds of molecules, which we call ""tadpoles"". We have demonstrated that we can use them to detect and count small numbers of molecules. These assays are relatively simple and relatively inexpensive, and they should be applicable to both kinds of cancer detection. During the next 3 years, we seek funding to develop and ""harden"" these assays to the point that they can be tested in clinical cancer diagnosis.",DNA;blood;human;learning;mass spectrometry;measurement;neoplasm /cancer;proteins;serum;small molecule,Roger Brent,John R Knowlton,326341,326341,2006-02-23T12:02:00Z,2006-02-23T12:02:00Z,2008-11-30T12:11:00Z,RFA-CA-06-002,nofo_RFA-CA-06-002,VTT/MSI  MOLECULAR SCIENCES INSTITUTE,berkeley,CA,UNITED STATES,imat,org_city,True
1R33CA118602-01,R33CA118602,7024335,2006,Technology/Map Endothelial Targets/Human Renal Tumors,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The molecular complexity and in vivo inaccessibility of most tumor cells within solid tumors can greatly limit genomic- and proteomic-based discovery of useful targets for tumor-specific imaging and therapeutic agents in vivo. To overcome endothelial cell (EC) barriers and achieve more effective targeting and penetration into solid tumors, we shift analytical focus from the tumor cell to the vascular EC surface and its caveolae in direct contact with the circulating blood. To reduce data complexity to a meaningful subset of targetable proteins expressed on the EC surface, we will use tissue sub-cellular fractionation, novel multimodal mass spectrometric analysis, in silico subtraction, and bioinformatics interrogation of structure and function to unmask, from the >100,000 proteins in the tissue, those few intravenously accessible proteins differentially expressed on vascular endothelium in human renal tumors. This technology and overall approach has been validated in rodent solid tumors whereby new vascular targets have been uncovered permitting tumor-specific imaging, penetration, and effective radio immunotherapy (Nature, 429:629-35, 2004). But, currently very little is known about the expression of proteins in tumor neovascular endothelium, especially in human tissue. We now wish to apply our new technology to map comprehensively the proteome of luminal EC surfaces and caveolae in human renal tumors in vivo. It is likely that human tumors will express a different constellation of proteins on tumor neovasculature not yet uncovered or induced in animal models. To this end, we propose the following specific aims: 1) To use novel tissue sub fractionation and proteomic analytical approaches to map comprehensively vascular EC surfaces and caveolae in human renal tumors vs. matched normal renal tissue to unmask candidate tumor-induced/associated vascular proteins. 2) To create new antibodies to newly discovered human renal tumor EC targets and to use antibodies as probes to validate the expression of tumor-induced/associated proteins at the EC surface and its caveolae in human tissues and thereby to assess the degree of target specificity for the neovasculature of human solid tumors. Such mapping may also elucidate the effects of the tumor on the developing vascular endothelium and yield important tumor-specific vascular targets for improving noninvasive diagnostic imaging and therapy as well as yield new diagnostic and prognostic markers for the molecular classification of tumor biopsies",clinical research;human;kidney;neoplasm /cancer;tissues,Jan Eugeniusz Schnitzer,John R Knowlton,714748,714748,2006-03-24T12:03:00Z,2006-06-01T12:06:00Z,2009-05-31T12:05:00Z,RFA-CA-06-003,nofo_RFA-CA-06-003,SIDNEY KIMMEL CANCER CENTER,san diego,CA,UNITED STATES,imat,org_city,False

1R33CA206922-01,R33CA206922,9147682,2016,Online Raman Diagnostics of Oncometabolites,"Project Abstract Cancer cells utilize normal metabolic processes out of context to promote tumor survival. For example, Otto Warburg and others discovered that tumors have increased glucose uptake, glycolysis, and lactate production, often with a reduction in citric acid cycle. While “aerobic glycolysis” at first glance is energetically expensive for tumor cells because it circumvents high ATP production from the citric acid cycle, it allows cancer cells to survive under low nutrient or low oxygen conditions and to instead use glycolytic intermediates for the synthesis of essential cellular building blocks without further energy investment. This change in metabolite regulation suggests a powerful method for monitoring and diagnosing cancer. This project seeks to develop surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) as online detection method for the characterization of metabolites from breast cancer tumor models. Using the SERS results from tumor lysates, diagnostic algorithms will be constructed to improve treatment for cancer. Results show that fluid dynamics can be used to increase the reproducibility and sensitivity of SERS detection in flowing liquids. We propose to develop methodology to enable the use this innovation to investigate metabolites in cancer cell lysates using capillary electrophoresis coupled to a SERS flow detector. We will investigate known metabolites that have been linked to cancer, as well as examine key metabolites associated with oncogenes. The SERS data collected will be used to formulate diagnostic algorithms that can provide a yes/no indicator of cancer. The specific aims of this project are as follows: · AIM 1. Demonstrate the utility of the novel flow detector to assess changes in key metabolites from tumor cell lysates. The tumor cell lysates will be compared with non-cancerous cell lysates to identify trends in these metabolites relevant to breast cancer. · AIM 2. Compare the identification and quantification capabilities with the current gold standard, LC- MS. This aim will assess how SERS characterization both compares with existing technology but also increases coverage of the metabolome. · AIM 3. We will use the metabolites to develop statistical machine learning algorithms to predict the sample label (cancer or not). The predictor obtained will be used as a diagnostic tool of cancer.

1R33CA225539-01,R33CA225539,9492281,2018,An integrated therapeutic T cell receptor screening platform for adoptive cell therapy in cancer,"Abstract Recent successes of T cell receptor based adoptive cell transfer therapy have generated new excitement about this therapeutic approach. However, lacking a high-throughput method of screening of naturally occurring high- affinity therapeutic T cell receptors (TCRs) has put a limit on how widely this approach can be applied to different kinds of cancers and a large range of patients. In this study, we propose to develop an integrated platform that on one hand drastically speeds up the identification and test of therapeutic TCRs and on the other hand, profiles common cancer antigens and HLAs expressed in tumor sample at single cell level. We name it Magic-HAT for Matching antigen identification in cancer with High-Affinity TCRs. The success of this project breaks the bottleneck of identifying and testing naturally occurring therapeutic high-affinity TCRs in adoptive cell transfer therapy setting for a large panel of cancer antigen epitopes.

However, their widespread use is limited by a number of difficulties in manufacturing such cells. Current manufacturing processes are complicated, costly, and can only produce cells for small populations. Additionally, they have large production variations. As a result, different patients receive very different products or treatments. The long-term goal is to develop a novel technology to address the CAR T manufacturing challenge. Toward this goal, the team has developed a proof- of-concept technology termed stress-free intra-tubular cell culture technology (SFIT). SFIT provides cells uniform, highly reproducible, controllable, and cell-friendly microenvironments, resulting in extremely high culture efficiency and consistency. SFIT produces cells for each patient with one small conical tube, significantly reducing production cost and increasing production capability. The purpose of this project is to further develop and validate this technology and the associated methods to make it ready for the final translational challenge. Leveraging sound preliminary studies and a diverse team of experts, the specific aims are to (1) validate SFIT for culturing T cells from a wide range of donors and for culturing various T cell subtypes, (2) further develop and validate methods for transducing T cells with lentivirus and γ-retrovirus in SFIT, and (3) further develop and validate the SFIT-based single-conical-tube-device for producing autologous CAR T cells. The project will build on the team’s strong preliminary work and include mathematical modeling, prototype device design, extensive T cell culturing, exome-Seq and RNA-Seq data analyses, in vivo testing, statistical analyses and comparisons, and partnership with ADS BIOTEC, a company that designs, builds, and sells instruments for processing human cells. With the completion of this project, simple, disposable, affordable devices for the scalable, cost-effective and consistent production of autologous CAR T cells are expected. This technology can also be scaled up for producing allogeneic CAR T cells in large scales if needed. This technology will not only make CAR T cells broadly accessible, but also make the product much more consistent and predictable. Based on 2012-2014 data, approximately 38.5% of the human population will be diagnosed with some type of cancer during their lifetime. Currently, only about 67% of cancer patients will survive five years after diagnosis. CAR T cell therapy is expected to significantly increase their chances of survival.

1R33CA281875-01,R33CA281875,10713795,2023,"MASTER Scaffolds for Rapid, Single-Step Manufacture and Prototyping of CAR-T cells","PROJECT SUMMARY Despite the unprecedented clinical success of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy, its widespread application is limited by lengthy and labor-intensive ex vivo manufacturing procedures that result in: (i) high cost; (ii) delays to infuse CAR cells to patients with rapidly progressing disease; and (iii) CAR cells with heterogeneous composition and terminal differentiation, which limit their engraftment and persistence. There is a clear scientific and medical need for approaches to improve CAR T cell production, including methods to reduce cell processing times, reduce manufacturing costs, and reduce CAR cell differentiation. Recently, our labs collaboratively developed a new technology for CAR cell production called MASTER (Multifunctional Alginate Scaffolds for T cell Engineering and Release). MASTER consists of dry, macroporous alginate materials conjugated to αCD3 and αCD28 antibodies and encapsulating interleukin signaling. CAR generation with MASTER technology involves seeding freshly isolated, non-activated patient PBMCs together with CAR-encoding retroviral vectors and implanting scaffolds back into patients. Once implanted, MASTER mediates every step of the CAR production process, thereby eliminating the current standard procedural steps of αCD3/αCD28 pre-activation, viral transduction with spinoculation and interleukin-mediated CAR expansion. In vitro MASTER-generated CAR cells demonstrate reduced cellular differentiation as compared to CAR cells generated with gold-standard, “conventional” clinical protocols. In vivo MASTER-generated CAR cells demonstrate far superior in vivo cell persistence, enhanced anti-tumor efficacy and far superior prevention of tumor growth after rechallenge. The utility of this system is two-fold: 1) as a transformative therapeutic technology creating enhanced and affordable CAR therapy for cancer care and 2) as a research tool enabling rapid development, prototyping and testing of CAR therapeutic candidates. We have assembled a focused, multidisciplinary team comprised of an expert in biomaterials and drug delivery (Brudno), an expert in viral engineering and protein production (Birnbaum), two specialists in clinical CAR cell production (Chen, Roy) and a clinician focused on CAR cell therapies (Grover). In this proposal we seek to further develop and validate MASTER scaffolds and the associated methods to make them ready for widescale utilization by the research and clinical communities, including researchers in related areas eager to work in the CAR field but deterred by the barriers to test CAR construct in vivo. Leveraging transformative preliminary data that show that the shelf-stable MASTER scaffolds outperform conventional CAR cells in preclinical mouse models of lymphoma, orthotopic pancreatic cancer, and metastatic lung and ovarian tumors this proposal will validate MASTER scaffolds with a wide range of donors and at different scales, with multiple viral vectors and CAR constructs and delineate the phenotype and function resulting from MASTER production of CAR cells.

2R44CA133987-03,R44CA133987,7692671,2010,Single Molecule Fiber Arrays for the Detection of Low Abundance Proteins,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The aim of this project is to develop a new technology that can be used to detect very low concentrations (femtomolar and below) of proteins that are diagnostic for cancer. Presently, early diagnosis of cancer is limited by the fact that the limits of detections (LOD) of available technologies, such as ELISA, are higher than the circulating concentrations of low abundance proteins that could indicate the onset of disease. This program would broaden and strengthen the use a novel fiber optic array single molecule detection technology for extremely high sensitivity measurement of cancer markers. This technology is digital in nature, i.e., individual molecules are quantified by their presence (""on"" signal) or their absence (""off"" signal). By focusing detection at the single molecule level, dramatic improvements in sensitivity are achieved for proteins. Phase I of this project demonstrated that single molecule detection makes it possible to detect concentrations of proteins at levels a thousand times lower than ELISA. Using single molecule detection, prostate specific antigen (PSA) was detected in serum at concentrations less than 1 femtomolar; current immunoanalyzers have an LOD of about 3 picomolar for PSA. The Phase II project has three specific aims that would build on these proof-of-principal experiments to broaden and strengthen the use of the technique for detection of cancer protein markers, and to move the technology closer to commercialization for use by medical researchers and clinicians. First, the ultra-sensitive PSA assay will be used to detect the marker in human clinical samples, specifically to measure the levels of PSA in prostate cancer patients who have undergone radical prostatectomy. Current technologies cannot detect PSA in these samples; this technology could enable the early detection of the return of PSA in serum, which would indicate residual disease. Second, the technology will be expanded to cover more classes of proteins, such as fusion proteins and post-translational modifications, to enable its broader implementation. Third, methods will be developed to measure panels of proteins at low concentrations using small sample volumes. These panels would enable the diagnosis of difficulty to detect diseases, such as ovarian cancer, with greater sensitivity and specificity. The long term objective of this research is to establish a new standard in high sensitivity detection of biological molecules (proteins, peptides, RNA, cells) using instrumentation that would be widely employed in both academic and clinical laboratories. Such an innovation would enable researchers to detect cancer markers at unprecedented levels for early diagnostic applications, and would facilitate the discovery of new low abundance cancer markers. This long term goal satisfies several aspects of the mission of the NIH, in particular, to develop innovative research strategies towards improving the diagnosis, prevention and cure of human diseases. The early diagnosis of cancer is determined by the ability of the clinical oncologist to detect the disease. Quanterix is proposing to develop a technology that would enable clinicians to detect very low concentrations of proteins in blood and, therefore, enable the early diagnosis of disease. This technology has the potential to help medical researchers and doctors to identify and detect many more early cancer diagnostic markers and improve outcomes for patients.",Area;Biological;Biological Assay;Biological Markers;Biological Models;Blood;Cancer Detection;Cancer Diagnostics;Cancer Patient;Cells;Chimeric Proteins;Clinical;Complex;Computer software;Detection;Diagnosis;Diagnostic;Disease;Early Diagnosis;Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay;Fiber;Fiber Optics;Goals;Human;Immunoassay;Individual;Laboratories;Malignant Neoplasms;Malignant neoplasm of ovary;Malignant neoplasm of prostate;Measurement;Measures;Medical;Methods;Mission;Modification;Molecular;Nature;Oncologist;Onset of illness;Operative Surgical Procedures;Outcome;Patients;Peptides;Phase;Prevention;Prostate specific antigen measurement;Prostate-Specific Antigen;Proteins;Radical Prostatectomy;Reading;Reagent;Reproducibility;Research;Research Personnel;Residual Tumors;Sampling;Sensitivity and Specificity;Serum;Signal Transduction;Techniques;Technology;Time;TimeLine;Translating;United States National Institutes of Health;base;cancer diagnosis;commercialization;digital;human disease;improved;innovation;instrument;instrumentation;meetings;new technology;next generation;novel;programs;protein complex;protein profiling;prototype;research study;single molecule;small molecule,David C Duffy,Patricia A Weber,749935,749935,2010-04-27T12:04:00Z,2008-08-01T12:08:00Z,2013-04-30T12:04:00Z,RFA-CA-08-011,nofo_RFA-CA-08-011,"TWIN LIGHTS BIOSCIENCE, INC.",cambridge,MA,UNITED STATES,imat,org_city,False

More recently, many have come to believe that some cancers might be detectable by ""signatures"", patterns of sets of molecules, perhaps normally present in the blood, but, in for certain cancers, present in higher or lower amounts than normal. Recently, we learned to make new kinds of molecules, which we call ""tadpoles"". We have demonstrated that we can use them to detect and count small numbers of molecules. These assays are relatively simple and relatively inexpensive, and they should be applicable to both kinds of cancer detection.

4R33CA083232-03,R33CA083232,6739927,2003,APTAMER BASED DETECTOR TO QUANTIFY MACROMOLECULES,"DESCRIPTION: (Applicant's Description) We propose to develop a technology to simultaneously detect and quantify large numbers individual proteins and post-translationally modified proteins. This technology will be based on a spatially-arrayed aptamer microchip and sensitive fluorescence-based optical detection techniques. The system will provide a powerful new tool for biomedical research and diagnosis of diseases and cancers. Currently, the levels of cellular proteins are inferred from cellular mRNA levels by using DNA oligonucleotide microchips. These microchips allow the detection of mRNA levels by base-pairing interactions to homologous DNA oligomers located at different sites in the microchip array. However, this indirect assay of protein levels suffers from two problems: First, mRNA levels may not accurately reflect the level of encoded protein because translation and degradation rates vary from protein to protein and are regulated in response to cell physiology. Second, post-translational modifications proteins often alter critical protein activities. This technology we propose to develop is comprised of three parts: 1) Aptamers with high-affinity and high-specifity for individual proteins. These aptamers will be designed to have ligand-dependent changes in fluorescence properties. 2) A microchip array with each array site occupied by aptamers against a different target molecule. 3) An evanescent field fluorescence detector which detects target molecules binding to aptamers at the array sites. Our proposal includes plans for: 1) selection of aptamers that can discriminate between different post-translational modifications of the same protein; 2) development of fluorescence-based techniques for detecting oligonucleotide:protein interactions; 3) design and construction of an optimized fluorescence detector; 4) scaling up methods to allow large numbers of independent aptamer selections against different proteins; 5) construction of a prototype protein chip.",macromolecule; messenger RNA; microprocessor /microchip; oligonucleotides; posttranslational modifications; proteins; technology /technique development,Andrew D Ellington,John R Knowlton,93033,93033,,2003-06-01T12:06:00Z,2004-05-31T12:05:00Z,PAR-99-100,nofo_PAR-99-100,ARCHEMIX CORPORATION,cambridge,MA,UNITED STATES,imat,org_city,False

The expression or over-expression of certain carbohydrates, such as sialyl Lewis X (sLex), sialyl Lewis a (sLea), Lewis X (Lex) and Lewis Y (Ley), has been correlated with the development of certain cancers. These cell surface carbohydrates can be used for cell-specific identification and targeting of carcinoma cells. The long-term goal of this project is the development of small molecule artificial receptors which can recognize target carbohydrate structures with high selectivity and affinity. Such receptors could be used for the development of fluorescent tags for cell- specific identification, tissue-specific imaging (such as MRI), and targeted delivery of therapeutic agents. In this study, we will use sLex as the model carbohydrate and use colon cancer as the model biological system because the expression of sLex is often associated with progression and metastasis of colon cancer. The short-term objective of this application is to develop tissue-specific fluorescent tags (sensors) which can recognize sLex with high affinity and selectivity. For the construction of such fluorescent sensors, we plan to use an integrated approach combining template-directed synthesis, combinatorial chemistry, and computer molecular modeling aided design. The sLex-specific artificial receptors have the potential to be used for cell identification, detection and tagging for the purpose of localization, staging, tissue biopsy, and fluorescence-directed surgical removal of colon cancer cells. Such tissue-specific compounds could also serve as vehicles for targeted delivery of cancer chemotherapeutic agents. These small molecule sensors may also have the following advantages over antibody-based detection/delivery systems: (1) greater stability during storage and in vivo; (2) increased permeability through biological membranes and, therefore, enhanced target accessibility; (3) intrinsic sensitivity to binding with significant fluorescence intensity increases, making detection and visualization easier and more suitable for high throughout screening, and (4) lower propensity to elicit undesirable immune responses. Similar methods, once developed, could also be used for the construction of fluorescent tags for other cell surface carbohydrates implicated in human malignancies.",carbohydrates; chemical models; colon neoplasms; combinatorial chemistry; computer simulation; drug design /synthesis /production; fluorescent dye /probe; surface antigens; tissue /cell culture,Binghe Wang,Daniel L.

4R33CA092752-02,R33CA092752,7249869,2006,Fast Mutation Detection by Tandem SSCP/HA on Microchips,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is proposed to optimize, evaluate, and pilot rapid, scalable, and low-cost microchip electrophoresis technologies for sensitive and specific molecular detection of cancer by tandem single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP)/heteroduplex analysis (HA), using the p53 gene as a model system. We request a 1-year R21 phase and a 3-year R33 phase. The proposed project involves collaboration between members of Northwestern's Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center, including researchers in Chemical Engineering, the Medical School, and Evanston Hospital. Microchannel ""tandem"" SSCP/HA is a novel mutation detection method recently developed in our laboratory, which involves the simultaneous generation and analysis of homo/heteroduplex DNA and SSCP conformers. Studies of a significant number of samples (32) indicate that tandem SSCP/HA allows for much higher-sensitivity mutation detection (100%) than SSCP alone (93%) or HA alone (75%), for p53 samples. We have developed and published optimized sample preparation protocols, gel formulations, and analysis conditions for capillary array electrophoresis (CAE). During the R21 phase, we will translate these methods to microfluidic electrophoresis chips, which offer a large increase in throughput and drop in cost of DNA analysis compared to CAE. The p53 gene, known to be mutated in >50% of human cancers, and whose mutation status can be predictive of patient response to chemotherapy, is the important model system chosen. However, microchip-based genetic analysis technologies to be developed should be easily applied to ANY cancer-related gene. In the R21 phase, we will analyze approximately 60 different DNA samples derived from tumor cell lines, representing a range of mutations in different p53 exons, to determine the impact of DNA sample characteristics and electrophoresis protocols on the sensitivity and specificity of the method, in a blinded study designed by collaborating biostatisticians. When optimized tandem SSCP/HA protocols have been developed for microchips, they will be piloted by the analysis of >200 selected samples amplified from frozen, solid tumors banked at Evanston Hospital. Via this blinded study, sensitivity and specificity (both expected to be at or near 100%) will be determined and reported for the first time using banked tumor tissue, providing necessary validation for clinical application of this technique, and making rapid, low-cost cancer genotyping technology widely available to physicians.",DNA;capillary electrophoresis;clinical research;cooperative study;diagnosis design /evaluation;diagnosis quality /standard;gene mutation;genotype;high throughput technology;immunocytochemistry;neoplasm /cancer diagnosis;nucleic acid quantitation /detection;nucleic acid sequence;p53 gene /protein;polymerase chain reaction;rapid diagnosis;single strand conformation polymorphism;statistics /biometry,Annelise Emily Barron,Avraham Rasooly,235917,235917,2006-07-25T12:07:00Z,2003-09-12T12:09:00Z,2009-05-31T12:05:00Z,PAR-01-106,nofo_PAR-01-106,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,evanston,IL,UNITED STATES,imat,org_city,False

The Laser Micropipet System (LMS), a new technology for the biochemical assay of kinases, holds the promise of directly assaying the activities of protein tyrosine kinases in primary patient cells. The LMS was developed for the assay of serine/threonine kinases in individual cells grown in tissue culture. This R21/R33 application proposes to expand the applications of this instrumentation to directly determine the activity of oncogenic tyrosine kinases in primary cells from patients. Assay of Bcr-Abl in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) will demonstrate the power of this tool for research, clinical, and pharmacologic applications. While this assay will be of value in the study of the biology and resistance mechanisms in CML, the studies will lay the groundwork for a new paradigm in the study of molecular mechanisms in cancer signal transduction and will have general applicability. The R21 phase of this proposal is designed to establish the feasibility of assaying Bcr-Abl activity and to demonstrate the necessary assay conditions for measurements in cells derived from a patient with CML. The specific aims are to: 1) identify and characterize a reporter of intracellular Bcr-Ab1 kinase activity, 2) define and optimize conditions for measuring Bcr-Ab1 activity in human cells, 3) compare reporter phosphorylation in cells expressing Bcr-Ab1 vs. cells lacking this kinase, and 4) demonstrate the feasibility of using primary patient cells in kinase assays. The goal of the R33 phase is to demonstrate the potential for the LMS-based kinase assay in applications for the study of the biology of pharmacologic resistance in CML, including from primary patient cells. The R33 specific aims are to: 1) develop a membrane-permeant Bcr-Ab1 kinase reporter, 2) demonstrate the ability to detect imatinib resistance in CML cell lines, 3) determine Bcr-Ab1 activity in primary cells from patients with CML and their response to pharmacologic inhibition, and 4) determine if the assay can detect the emergence of imatinib resistance in CML patients and can differentiate the mechanisms of drug resistance.",biological signal transduction;capillary electrophoresis;carcinogenesis;cell growth regulation;chronic myelogenous leukemia;clinical research;enzyme activity;enzyme mechanism;gene expression;human subject;intracellular;neoplastic cell;oncoproteins;phosphorylation;protein purification;protein tyrosine kinase;reporter genes;single cell analysis;technology /technique development,Christopher E Sims,Min-Kyung H Song,481662,481662,2005-08-08T12:08:00Z,2005-08-08T12:08:00Z,2008-07-31T12:07:00Z,PAR-01-106,nofo_PAR-01-106,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,irvine,CA,UNITED STATES,imat,org_city,False
4R33CA107943-02,R33CA107943,7194502,2006,A Novel Proteomics Technology for Protein Farnesylation,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The identification and characterization of changes in the level of farnesylated proteins in response to the treatment of farnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTIs), a newly introduced family of antitumor agents currently undergoing clinical evaluation, represents a major scientific challenge. Extant proteomics methods are limited to quantifying a few thousands of the most abundant proteins and, therefore, are unsuitable for the targeted profiling of less abundant farnesylated expression. The major goal of this application is to develop and validate a powerful technology, Tagging via Azido Substrate (TAS), for the efficient isolation of farnesylated proteins. This technology will then be applied to the proteomics analysis of farnesylated proteins in physiologically relevant models. The TAS technology involves the introduction of a synthetic azide-modified farnesyl substrate, either farnesyl azide diphosphate (FPP-azide) or farnesyl azide alcohol (F-azide-OH), which replaces the natural substrate during cellular protein farnesylation. The resulting farnesyl-azide (F-azide)-modified proteins will be affinity-purified through an azide-specific conjugation reaction (Staudinger reaction) using a phosphine capture reagent linked to photo-cleavable beads, which can then be released by UV light-induced photo-cleavage. Since affinity purification relies on covalent bonding resulting from a specific conjugation reaction between an azide and phosphine capture reagent, other proteins without the F-azide modification can be effectively removed by thorough washing. Thus, the TAS technology will allow farnesylated proteins to be isolated with high yield, high specificity, and low contamination. The initial focus of the R21 portion of this proposal is on the development of TAS technology and its application to the isolation of farnesylated proteins. These studies will be extended subsequently to geranylgeranylated proteins. The R33 proposal will aim at applications of the TAS technology to the identification of novel FTI targets. These studies will provide fundamental information for the understanding of molecular mechanisms of FTI functions and are likely to identify novel targets for antitumor drug design.",,Yingming Zhao,John R Knowlton,506055,506055,2006-04-07T12:04:00Z,2004-06-07T12:06:00Z,2009-03-31T12:03:00Z,PAR-01-104,nofo_PAR-01-104,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,dallas,TX,UNITED STATES,imat,org_city,False
4R33CA114149-02,R33CA114149,7281787,2006,Imaging tumor associated fibroblast activation protein,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this research is to develop a novel fibroblast activation protein (FAP) sensing near infrared fluorescence reporter for early tumor detection and tumor classification. FAP is a cell surface antigen of reactive tumor stromal fibroblasts founded in more than 90% of epithelial carcinomas, but it is absent from epithelial carcinoma cells, normal fibroblasts, and other normal human tissue. Supporting tumor stromal fibroblasts are generally localized close to tumor vasculature, which is essential for early tumor development and growth. Thus it has been chosen as a target for monoclonal antibody based tumor therapy. FAP is not only a membrane protein but also a dipeptidyl peptidase. An imaging probe to report enzymatic activity and location of FAP could be extremely useful for early tumor detection. In this application we will develop a small molecular probe with ultra-sensitivity based on a unique class of fluorogenic chromophore that has significant changes in emission at different chemical states. Specifically, the probes emit no fluorescence in their initial intact state but become brightly fluorescent after specific proteolytic reaction. The newly developed low molecular weight, well defined fluorogenic probes are expected to have several advantages for imaging: a) fast tissue distribution allowing earlier imaging after injection, b) fast clearance allowing repeated imaging, and c) high likelihood of developing key candidates into clinically useful agents. The choice of FAP is based on its importance in tumor growth, invasion, and other processes in oncogenesis. Together with recent developments in fluorescence imaging technologies, this research is expected to ultimately result in clinical imaging agents with specificity for targeted enzymes. We believe that the developed approach can be used as a platform to design a broad spectrum of activatable molecular probes to image other amino peptidases in vivo.",aminopeptidase;athymic mouse;bioimaging /biomedical imaging;chemical synthesis;colon neoplasms;enzyme activity;enzyme induction /repression;fibroblasts;fluorescent dye /probe;ionophores;molecular /cellular imaging;molecular probes;neoplasm /cancer diagnosis;neoplasm /cancer transplantation;peptidyl dipeptidase;technology /technique development,Ching-Hsuan Tung,James W.

The assay proposed relies on an electro catalytic process involving two transition-metal ions that reports on biomolecular complexation events. Because the reporter system responds to changes in the electrostatics of an electrode surface, it will enable the analysis of nucleic acids/protein and peptide/protein complexes. The proposed project has 3 specific aims: 1) electro catalytic detection of DNA repair proteins implicated in cancer using DNA-modified electrodes; 2) optimization of electro catalytic detection and multiplexed analysis of cellular DNA repair activities, and 3) development of a generalized electro catalytic protein detection method using prostate cancer biomarkers. The electro catalytic protein detection system described is advantageous because it will allow the analysis and discrimination of multiprotein complexes in addition to uncomplexed analytes and will have high selectivity and specificity.

5R21CA114852-02,R21CA114852,7077713,2006,Profile serum proteins by glycopeptide capture and LC-MS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancers develop over a period of several years and they are characterized by molecular changes prior to invasion and metastasis. Development of a technology that enables screening of cancer from body fluids could permit cancer detection at early and treatable stages. It is expected that the composition of the serum proteome contains valuable information about the state of the human body in health and disease, and that this information can be extracted via quantitative proteomic measurements. Suitable proteomic techniques need to be sensitive, reproducible and robust, to detect potential biomarkers below the level of highly expressed proteins, to generate data sets that are comparable between experiments and laboratories, and have high throughput to support studies with sufficient statistical power. In this proposal, we will develop a method for high throughput quantitative analysis of serum proteins. It consists of the selective isolation of the peptides that are N-linked glycosylated in the intact protein using solid-phase extraction of glycopeptides (SPEG) on a robotic workstation, the analysis of these now de-glycosylated peptides by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS), and the comparative analysis of the resulting patterns. By focusing selectively on a few formerly N-linked glycopeptides per serum protein, the complexity of the analyte sample is significantly reduced, and the sensitivity, reproducibility, and throughput of serum proteome analysis are increased compared with the analysis of total tryptic peptides from unfractionated samples. We will explore the feasibility to identify cancer-specific serum proteins in the background of normal variation using a carcinogen-induced skin cancer mouse model. The specific aims are: 1) To develop chemistries and protocols for an automatic robotic system to isolate N-linked glycopeptides from serum in a high throughput and highly reproducible fashion; 2) To develop efficient and reproducible procedures for LC-MS analyses, and sequence identification of discriminatory peptides by tandem mass spectrometry; 3) To explore the feasibility of this method for the identification of distinctive serum peptides specific to cancer-bearing mice in the background of normal variations. If successful, the proposed research could subsequently be used for profiling human serum samples from cancer patients and normal individuals to identify the cancer-associated proteins in serum.

5R21CA116060-02,R21CA116060,7140157,2006,REVERSIBLE PROMOTER-INSERTION FOR IN VIVO STUDIES OF MELANOMA,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is commonly accepted that the processes underlying the development of cancer are best modeled in vivo. A plethora of methods have been developed for genetic dissection of biological processes in somatic cells in culture; however, the adaptation of these techniques to in vivo use has been very limited. Our earlier experience indicates that reversible promoter-insertion mutagenesis offers a number of advantages over the currently used forward genetics techniques for cultured cells. The most important benefits are the dominant nature of the mutations, and the ease of identifying the affected gene and establishing the causal link between the mutation and the phenotype. The principal limitation for the adaptation of this technique to in vivo studies is the delivery of the insertional mutagen (typically, a retroviral vector) to the desired cell type. Based on our recent experience and published data from others, we propose a method to circumvent this limitation via the use of specially engineered transposon vectors. We propose to apply our technique to study the genetic events underlying melanoma development. We will screen for genetic events that cooperate with oncogenic Ras (commonly found in melanomas) in this process. We will confirm the properties of the proposed insertional mutagens in culture and then proceed to establish mouse strains suitable for mutagenesis. Upon verifying the properties of our constructs in vivo, we will selectively mutagenize melanocytes in transgenic animals and will test the functional link between tumorigenesis and the inserted promoter. Confirmed hits will be the subject of future investigation, while the technique itself will become available for dissection of various biological phenomena in general and aspects of tumorigenesis, in particular.",biomarker;biotechnology;cell line;gene mutation;genetically modified animals;guanine nucleotide binding protein;laboratory mouse;melanocyte;melanoma;neoplasm /cancer genetics;oncogenes;technology /technique development;tetracyclines;tissue /cell culture;transfection /expression vector;transposon /insertion element,Eugene S Kandel,Jennifer A.

5R21CA118632-02,R21CA118632,7459633,2008,Defining the Multiple Myeloma Kinome,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gene profiling technology has enabled analysis of the transcriptome and proteome of tumor cells. This information has provided useful information with regard to molecular mechanisms that define the enhanced survival and proliferation of MM cells. However, an equally, if not more important, goal is to define those proteins that participate in signaling pathways active in MM cells and their supporting stroma. Enzymes that phosphorylate tyrosine, serins and threonine residues on other proteins play a major role in signaling cascades that determine cell cycle entry and survival in MM and the stromal cells that support them. In particular, knowing the signaling pathways that are active in MM cells and their supporting stroma will provide critical information for understanding MM cell survival in the BM. We have developed and are applying to purified cells a novel array-based strategy that allows the simultaneous detection of phosphorylation for 1152 different kinase substrates. Here we propose to apply this emerging technology to the analysis of phosphorylation-based cell signaling pathways in MM and their supporting stroma. This R21/R33 Phased Innovation application will be pursued in two phases. In the R21 phase of this application Aims 1 and 2 will validate that PepChip technology can be applied to MM cells and their microenvironment to reveal signaling alterations in MM. In Aim 3 of the R33 phase we will use PepChip technology to identify kinome alterations within the MM patient population that are correlated with clinical parameters such as relapse and chromosomal abnormalities associated with poor prognosis. In Aim 4 we will utilize an in vivo model that supports the growth of primary patient isolates in RAG2XGammaC mice to determine the effect of therapeutics on the kinome of MM cells.

5R21CA123018-02,R21CA123018,7295672,2007,Epigenetic Targeting in Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hypermethylation of promoter CpG islands plays a prominent role in cancer. In partnership with alterations in histone acetylation/methylation, this epigenetic event establishes a repressive chromatin structure that leads to silencing of key cancer-related genes. The occurrence of DNA methylation within the genome is not random, but rather patterns of methylation are generated that are gene and tumor type specific. How DNA methylation patterns are established is still poorly understood. Since various transcriptional factors or regulators are found in association with DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) in vivo, we hypothesize that: 1) Oncogenic transcription factors can recruit DNMTs to target gene promoters and define a unique epigenetic signature in tumor cells; 2) Dissecting such complex epigenetic hierarchy will identify novel molecular targets for diagnosis, prognosis and therapeutic intervention. To test our hypothesis, we developed a high throughput technique for genome wide analysis of DNA methylation associated with specific proteins such as histones, transcription factors or any DNA binding proteins. The new approach named ChlP-Chop-DMH will combine both genome wide location analysis (also known as ChlP-on-Chip) and Differential Methylation Hybridization (DMH) analysis, two emerging technologies used in epigenetic research. The proposed method has distinct advantages over current protocols: first, this method directly examines the in vivo interaction of specific proteins with methylated DNA throughout the genome; second, this method may uncover novel biological properties of transcription factors; third, this method can be applied to discover novel epigenetic biomarkers relevant to tumorigenesis. In preliminary studies, we have verified the utility of this method with methylated histone H3 at lysine 9 and lysine 4 in human cancer cells. In the R21 phase, we will continue minor refinement of the method and pursue three aims: 1) Improve and optimize the ChlP-Chop-DMH method for analyzing genome wide association of DNA methylation with histone modification; 2) Utilize the proposed method to investigate the association of DNA methylation with chromatin remodeling factors: 3) Show proof-of-concept using the array to examine primary non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHLs). In this development phase we will focus on the sensitivity, reproducibility and accuracy of the proposed method. In the R33 phase, our goal is to utilize the technology to test biological hypotheses. We will fully implement the method and pursue these aims: 1) Discover epigenetic target genes associated with known oncogenic transcription factors c-Myc and BCL6: 2) Validate the identified epigenetic targets and investigate the regulatory role of the associated oncogenic transcription factors. This systematic approach will provide a powerful tool for future mechanistic studies as well as cancer diagnosis.",Algorithms;Antibodies;B-Cell Neoplasm;B-Cell NonHodgkins Lymphoma;B-Lymphocytes;BCL6 gene;Binding;Bioinformatics;Biological;Biological Assay;Biological Markers;Biological Testing;Cell Line;Cells;Chromatin Remodeling Factor;Chromatin Structure;Classification;Clinical;Cobra;Complex;CpG Islands;DNA;DNA Methylation;DNA Methyltransferase;DNA Modification Methylases;DNA-Binding Proteins;Development;Diagnosis;EZH2 gene;Emerging Technologies;Epigenetic Process;Event;Future;Gene Targeting;Genes;Genome;Goals;Histone Acetylation;Histone H3;Histones;Human;Hypermethylation;Location;Luciferases;Lymphoma;Lymphomagenesis;Lysine;Malignant Neoplasms;Measures;Methods;Methyl-CpG-Binding Protein 2;Methylation;Minor;Modeling;Modification;Molecular Target;Names;Non-Hodgkin&apos;s Lymphoma;Oncogene Proteins;Oncogenic;Pattern;Phase;Play;Polymerase Chain Reaction;Property;Proteins;Protocols documentation;Recruitment Activity;Reporter;Reproducibility;Research;Research Personnel;Role;Sampling;Small Interfering RNA;Standards of Weights and Measures;Techniques;Technology;Testing;Therapeutic Intervention;Validation;c-myc Genes;cancer cell;cancer diagnosis;concept;genome wide association study;genome-wide analysis;improved;in vivo;neoplastic cell;novel;novel strategies;outcome forecast;programs;promoter;tool;transcription factor;tumor;tumorigenesis;vector,Huidong Shi,Jerry Li,151532,151532,2007-08-10T12:08:00Z,2006-09-26T12:09:00Z,2008-12-31T12:12:00Z,RFA-CA-06-003,nofo_RFA-CA-06-003,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,columbia,MO,UNITED STATES,imat,org_city,False
5R21CA125285-02,R21CA125285,7499610,2008,Transfected cell arrays for cancer research,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A major challenge in cancer biology is to understand how genotypic abnormalities or mutations will alter cellular responses, such as cell cycle regulation and drug resistance, involved in cancer progression. Our long-term goal is to investigate the early events in cancer progression and how they impact clinical outcome from the perspective of transcription factor (TF) activity, which relates to the activity of the signaling pathways. We hypothesize that cell-based assays that report on the activity of various signaling pathways within the cancer cells will link genotype to phenotype. The objective of this proposal is to develop a transfected cell array for high throughput analysis of TF activity in cancer cells, with breast cancer serving as a model. Our hypothesis and proposed research are based on the following observations: a) cDNA or protein microarrays cannot predict cellular activity, as activity is based on a specific protein conformation or state and cellular localization, b) cell-based assays provide the physiological context in which to examine cellular activity, c) TF activity is widely used to measure cellular activity using a two-plasmid system: one measures the activity of a specific TF and the second normalizes for the transfection efficiency: Based on these observations, the experimental objectives of the proposal are to develop a high throughput system to quantify activity of many TFs. The specific aims of the proposal are: Specific Aim 1: Create a transfected cell array with 100 spots capable of localized, efficient transfection of breast cancer cell lines. We will a) develop the procedures to deposit lipoplexes in spots while retaining their bioactivity and b) quantify the percentage of transfected cells and transgene expression in the spot. Specific Aim 2: Validate the transfected cell array for quantifying TF activity by a) determining ratio of the two plasmids and positional consistency between array spots and b) quantifying TF activity non-invasively using an imaging technique that enables following the TF activity over time. Specific Aim 3: Compare the TF activity for cells differing by one or more genotypic mutations. We will characterize TF activity for a) mammary epithelial cells immortalized by TERT (76NTERT) or by mutant p53 (76Ndel239) and b) primary tumor and malignant tumor cells, which were established from the same patient.

5R21CA125398-02,R21CA125398,7493071,2008,The Kinomes of Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gene profiling technology has enabled analysis of the transcriptome and proteome of tumor cells. In fact, massively parallel analysis of the Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) transcriptome has revealed discrete gene profile signatures for the major subtypes of NHL, diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and follicular lymphoma (FL). This information has provided useful insights into molecular mechanisms that promote enhanced survival and proliferation in NHL. However, an equally, if not more important goal, is to define those proteins that participate in signaling pathways active in lymphoma cells and non-malignant cells that infiltrate these tumors. Enzymes that phosphorylate tyrosine, serine and threonine residues on other proteins play a major role in signaling cascades that control cell cycle entry, survival, angiogenesis and the immune response. Defining how these signaling pathways are altered in NHL B cells and non- malignant cells present in these tumors will provide critical information for understanding how lymphoma survives, proliferates and interacts with other cells at the tumor site. We are applying to purified tumor cells a novel array strategy that allows the simultaneous detection of phosphorylation for 1152 different kinase substrates. Here we propose to apply this emerging technology to the analysis of phosphorylation-based cell signaling pathways in NHL. This proposal will be pursued in two phases. The R21 phase will consist of two aims that will validate PepChip technology can identify kinome alterations in primary DLBCL (Aim 1) and FL (Aim 2) isolates. The R33 phase will consist of two aims that will define kinome alterations in DLBCL (Aim 3) and FL (Aim 4) that correlate with clinical parameters. In Aim 5 we will utilize in vivo models of FL and DLBCL to determine whether inhibitors specific for deregulated kinases inhibit growth of NHL tumors in immunodeficient mice. This study will be pursued in the following phased R21/R33 format: R21 Phase: Aim 1: Define the kinome of DLBCL B cells and non-malignant cells present in these tumors. Aim 2: Define the kinome of FL B cells and non-malignant cells present in these tumors. Aim 3: Identify kinome alterations in DLBCL correlated with clinical parameters of disease. R33 Phase: Aim 4: Identify kinome alterations in FL correlated with clinical parameters of disease.

5R21CA132806-02,R21CA132806,7609116,2009,Standardized NanoArray PCR for Gene Expression Profiling of Lung Cancer,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Molecular characterization of cancer, in particular by gene transcription profiling, has great potential to improve prognosis, therapeutic selection and clinical outcomes. However, the potential for using expression signatures for cancer prognosis and treatment selection is hampered by lack of readily deployable test kits with the accuracy, low RNA requirement and inter-site concordance required for routine clinical use. We propose an innovative solution based on two well-validated PCR technologies whose combination uniquely addresses the problem of diagnostic assay reproducibility. Our plan is to implement Standardized RT (StaRT)-PCR, a proven competitive PCR method developed at the University of Toledo, in a novel nanofluidic PCR platform developed by BioTrove Inc. in order to streamline the fluidic workflow, improve measurement throughput, and at the same time reduce test cost and maintain low RNA input. As compared to existing hybridization or real-time qPCR approaches, Standardized NanoArray PCR (SNAP) will provide the same dynamic range and quality as RT-PCR, yet require less RNA input and be more readily clinically deployable. The development will entail step-wise integration of proven technologies. First, real-time qPCR TaqMan assays will be developed for 16 lung tumor prognostic genes. These assays will be converted to StaRT-PCR by creation of competitive template and a competitor specific dye-labeled probe. Adding a pre-amplification step to StaRT-PCR will reduce the RNA input requirements to enable thousands of tests per sample. Finally, moving the assays into the OpenArray nano-PCR plate will streamline fluid handling. Using RNA isolated from lung clinical tumor resections, dynamic range and precision equivalent to real-time qPCR will be demonstrated for the integrated platform. After the initial development phase is complete, we will compare SNAP and real time qPCR in two critical gene expression profiling experiments. First we will compare the minimum amount of RNA required for each method by monitoring loss of precision as a function of decreasing RNA sample input. Second we will demonstrate lower inter-site variability, a critical factor for deploy-ability, by measuring gene expression profiles of seven lung tumor resection samples in three laboratories. Meeting these Specific Aims will lead to seeking further funding for multi-site prognostic validation studies involving formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) lung specimens with extensive clinical history.",Address;Adoption;Biological Assay;Cancer Prognosis;Characteristics;Chemistry;Clinical;Color;Consumption;Detection;Development;Diagnostic;Diagnostic Procedure;Diagnostic tests;Dyes;End Point Assay;Excision;Formalin;Freezing;Funding;Gene Expression;Gene Expression Profile;Gene Expression Profiling;Genes;Genetic Transcription;Genomics;Goals;Health;Label;Laboratories;Lead;Liquid substance;Lung;Lung Neoplasms;Malignant Neoplasms;Malignant neoplasm of lung;Measurement;Measures;Methods;Molecular;Molecular Diagnostic Testing;Molecular Profiling;Monitor;Morphologic artifacts;Nanoarray Analytical Device;Operative Surgical Procedures;Outcome;Paraffin Embedding;Performance;Phase;Quality Control;RNA;Recording of previous events;Reproducibility;Running;Sampling;Selection for Treatments;Site;Solutions;Specimen;Speed;Staging;System;Taq Polymerase;Technology;Testing;Therapeutic;Time;Universities;Validation;base;cost;design;flexibility;improved;inhibitor/antagonist;innovation;malignant breast neoplasm;meetings;nano;nanofluidic;neoplastic;novel;nuclease;outcome forecast;prognostic;research study;tumor;validation studies,Tony E Godfrey; Tom B Morrison; James C.

5R21CA138333-03,R21CA138333,8516466,2013,Methods of systematic microRNA target validation and identification,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is well known that microRNAs could play a fundamental role in regulation of diverse cellular functions. As key gene regulators, microRNAs work through a posttranscriptional repression mechanism. Increasing evidence indicates that deregulation of microRNA expression could lead to a variety of disorders including human cancer. Although significant progress has been made in the past years in discovery of microRNAs and their biogenesis, and their role in many cellular phenotypes, it is not fully understood how microRNAs exert their cellular functions because a single microRNA can have hundreds of targets. Hence, identification of microRNA targets is a critical step toward understanding of molecular mechanisms of microRNA-mediated gene expression in normal and disease processes. Currently, this largely relies on computer-aided algorithms, which unfortunately are still unable to provide a precise picture of microRNA regulatory networks, and thus the predicted targets need further experimental validations. It is evident that target validation is a bottle neck in our effort to dissect microRNA pathways. In this application, we propose to develop a novel selection method for microRNA target validation and identification through two complementary approaches. The first approach is to determine microRNA/mRNA interactions using our pre-microRNA collection against a specific target cloned in our selection plasmid; the second approach is to determine microRNA/mRNA interactions using a 3'-UTR (untranslated region) library against a specific microRNA. We believe that our selection method is innovative, simple and powerful. An additional benefit of this method will allow us to determine whether there are any new features, besides the seed sequence homology, which could contribute to the specificity of microRNA targeting. Accordingly, this study will greatly enhance our understanding of microRNA targeting and gene regulation by providing a valuable research tool.",Algorithms;Biogenesis;Cell physiology;Collection;Complementary DNA;Computer Assisted;Databases;Disease;Functional RNA;Gene Expression;Gene Expression Regulation;Gene Targeting;Genes;Human;Lead;Learning;Libraries;Malignant Neoplasms;Mediating;Messenger RNA;Methods;MicroRNAs;Molecular;Neck;Normal Cell;Pathway interactions;Phenotype;Plasmids;Play;Process;Regulation;Regulator Genes;Repression;Research;Role;Science;Seeds;Sequence Homology;Source;Specificity;System;Technology;Testing;Translational Repression;Untranslated Regions;Validation;Work;base;human disease;innovation;mRNA Transcript Degradation;novel;research study;success;tool,Yin-Yuan Mo,Jerry Li,174960,174960,2013-06-25T12:06:00Z,2011-07-01T12:07:00Z,2015-06-30T12:06:00Z,RFA-CA-10-005,nofo_RFA-CA-10-005,UNIVERSITY OF MISSISSIPPI MED CTR,jackson,MS,UNITED STATES,imat,org_city,False

5R21CA191186-02,R21CA191186,9015419,2016,Droplet Microfluidic Platform for Ultralow Input Epigenetics,"﻿ DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epigenomic analyses are playing increasingly prominent roles in the development of personalized strategies for treating cancer. However, the translation of fundamental epigenomic insight to the clinic is wrought with challenges. Take for example the study of post-translational histone protein modifications, which can serve to either promote or repress the transcription of pendant DNA sequences. Analyses of these critically important interactions bridge genomics and proteomics and present significant challenges in the clinical setting. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) is the method of choice for analyzing protein-DNA interactions and the basic method involves fragmentation of chromatin, separation of modified proteins using antibodies and magnetic beads, and subsequent analysis of the associated DNA by qPCR or sequencing. While sounding simple, a typical ChIP workflow involves ~30 steps, takes 4+ days, and requires 106-107 cells as input. These requirements significantly limit the applicability of ChIP in a clinical setting-particularly when minimal sampl is available, such as in the analysis of tumor biopsies, stem cells, or circulating tumor cells. Microfluidic devices offer many attractive benefits over traditional macro-scale methods including reduced volume requirements, parallelization capability, and automated operation, which make them particularly well- suited to sample-constrained epigenetic analyses. A handful of recent reports suggest a substantial opportunity for microfluidically-enabled ChIP analyses; however, there is still considerable room for further improvement. We propose to develop a powerful and versatile, droplet microfluidics-based, nanoliter-scale Chromatin ImmunoCapture (nChIC) platform suitable for individualized medicine applications. Droplet microfluidics offer several benefits, including rapid, controlled, and efficient fluid handling, and the capacity to handle variable sample sizes, since devices can accommodate larger samples by simply operating for longer periods of time. Our nChIC platform will incorporate every major step in the ChIP workflow into an automated device, including cell lysis, chromatin digestion, immunocapture, and DNA purification.

5R21CA191186-04,R21CA191186,9201319,2017,Droplet Microfluidic Platform for Ultralow Input Epigenetics,"﻿ DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epigenomic analyses are playing increasingly prominent roles in the development of personalized strategies for treating cancer. However, the translation of fundamental epigenomic insight to the clinic is wrought with challenges. Take for example the study of post-translational histone protein modifications, which can serve to either promote or repress the transcription of pendant DNA sequences. Analyses of these critically important interactions bridge genomics and proteomics and present significant challenges in the clinical setting. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) is the method of choice for analyzing protein-DNA interactions and the basic method involves fragmentation of chromatin, separation of modified proteins using antibodies and magnetic beads, and subsequent analysis of the associated DNA by qPCR or sequencing. While sounding simple, a typical ChIP workflow involves ~30 steps, takes 4+ days, and requires 106-107 cells as input. These requirements significantly limit the applicability of ChIP in a clinical setting-particularly when minimal sampl is available, such as in the analysis of tumor biopsies, stem cells, or circulating tumor cells. Microfluidic devices offer many attractive benefits over traditional macro-scale methods including reduced volume requirements, parallelization capability, and automated operation, which make them particularly well- suited to sample-constrained epigenetic analyses. A handful of recent reports suggest a substantial opportunity for microfluidically-enabled ChIP analyses; however, there is still considerable room for further improvement. We propose to develop a powerful and versatile, droplet microfluidics-based, nanoliter-scale Chromatin ImmunoCapture (nChIC) platform suitable for individualized medicine applications. Droplet microfluidics offer several benefits, including rapid, controlled, and efficient fluid handling, and the capacity to handle variable sample sizes, since devices can accommodate larger samples by simply operating for longer periods of time. Our nChIC platform will incorporate every major step in the ChIP workflow into an automated device, including cell lysis, chromatin digestion, immunocapture, and DNA purification. Importantly, these processes will be carried out at the single cell level, which promises to provide unique insights into epigenomic tumor heterogeneity. Beyond single cells, the unprecedented ability to handle samples of variable input will also facilitate robust validation against traditional ChIP assays to demonstrate broad genomic coverage.

Investigators' long-term goal, to be pursued in R33 phase, is to develop T cells into a platform vector technology for active drug- transport to the solid tumors. In this R21 application, their objective is to engineer a robust mechanism to transform autologous T cells into biofactories for autonomous synthesis of cytocidal secretory proteins upon stimulation by the tumor cells. Autonomous synthesis of Protein-of-Interest (PoI) with spatiotemporal resolution will enable targeting of tumor burden with cellular resolution and molecular specificity. Their central hypothesis is that T cells can be genetically encoded for robust modulation and biosynthesis of therapeutic proteins at the tumor site. They have chosen ovarian cancer that expresses Folate Receptor alpha (FRa) as disease model, and an apoptotic protein for its cytotoxic therapeutic value. However, the rationale for developing T cells as protein biofactories is that this is a platform technology and their specificity can be modified to target any cancer and autonomously synthesize any PoI in situ. To aid this R21 effort, they have developed cell lines expressing bioluminescent and fluorescent reporters expressed only when stimulated by tumor cells. With following specific aims, they will advance this project towards its goals: (1) To develop robust control on biosynthesis of protein-of-interest (PoI); (2) To develop T cells as biofactories for autonomous secretion of antitumor apoptotic protein. It is expected that this R21 phase will lead to T cells that will not activate in healthy tissues (enhanced safety) and hyperactivate specifically in the tumor microenvironment (enhanced efficacy). The impact of this research will also be felt on ongoing T-cell therapy trials by reducing the incidences of graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD). This pioneering approach builds upon ongoing T-cell immunotherapy trials, which are currently limited to control minimal residual disease (MRD) and is administered after chemotherapy. Proposed research is transformative, firstly because it will expand the scope of T-cell engineering to replace systemic chemotherapies. This will then be used for reduction of tumor burden rather than keeping MRD in check. Secondly, therapeutic proteins of non-human origin are efficiently degraded and removed by the immune system. This is a barrier to their in vivo application. The use of autologous T cells for biosynthesis of therapeutic proteins at the target site will eliminate any immunogenicity issues.

Recent single cell genetic studies have shown that driver mutations and cancer cell subtype are highly heterogeneous within a single patient. Thus, clinicians will need to employ experimental methods that allow observation of a variety of molecular analytes across many individual cells within a particular patient's tumor section in situ. Current tumor section analyses are not highly multiplexed and typically remain limited to ~4-5 analytes, or 7 with multi-spectral imaging. Recent technologies have pushed this number into 30s-60s, but they require expensive equipment and/or reagents, sophisticated analyses or markedly increased assay time, all of which would preclude their practical use in many clinical pathology and preclinical research laboratories. Thus, there remains a significant need for technologies that multiplex measurements in tumor sections but are widely accessible and cost-effective. We focus on addressing this need with a readily-adoptable but novel multi- spectral fluorescence-based method. It is based on the hypothesis that the power of combinatorics can be harnessed to vastly increase the number of quantifiable analytes in a mixture by permuting the wide array of available fluorophores in new ways. We term our approach combinatorial fluorescence with spectral imaging (CoFSI). CoFSI only requires the ability to perform multi-channel fluorescence excitation and emission spectral scanning, which is widely available and easy to implement in most plate/slide readers and many microscopes. Data analysis involves a straightforward, fast computational technique called linear unmixing. Preliminary simulation studies suggest that the concentrations of 123 different CoFSI probes constructed from 16 existing fluorescent proteins can be estimated simultaneously with good accuracy and precision across 3 orders of concentration magnitude with a large number of excitation channels, and 48 probes with 6 excitation channels. Similar simulation studies constrained by available tumor section imaging equipment and Alexa dyes suggest 25 simultaneous measurements are possible. Initial pilot experiments demonstrate that seven different CoFSI probe levels in a mixture can be measured both accurately and precisely using only the blue-yellow part of the spectrum. This proposal further tests the limits of CoFSI experimentally, and applies CoFSI to tumor section imaging, with two Aims: (1) Quantify the Levels of 48 Fluorescent Probes in a Mixture Simultaneously; and (2) Quantify the Spatial Distribution of 25 Analytes in Tumor Sections. If successful, CoFSI can increase quantitative fluorescence multiplexing at least ~5 to 10-fold while relying on standard lab resources and straightforward analyses.

5R21CA202831-02,R21CA202831,9257339,2017,Novel Bi-functional Inhibitors Blocking OncomiR Biogenesis,"﻿ DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this proposal is to develop a new class of selective miRNA regulators that blocks the maturation of oncomiRs. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate diverse biological processes. Dysregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) has become one of the emerging mechanisms contributes to cancer formation and progression. Increasing evidences suggest that certain miRNAs affect cellular transformation, carcinogenesis and metastasis, and act as oncogenes (oncogenic miRNAs or oncomiRs). Understanding the roles of oncomiRs in cancer will lead to the development of new cancer therapies. Besides, direct therapeutic intervention of oncomiRs has become a promising new direction for treating cancer. For both research and therapeutic purposes, methods allowing the control of oncomiR levels are highly desirable. Current methods for such purposes generally suffer from the off-target inhibition. To address this critical issue, we propose a novel strategy to regulate miRNA. We will develop a new class of bi-functional miRNA regulators consisting of independent and specialized ""pre-miRNA recognition unit"" and ""Dicer inhibition unit"" to target unique pre- miRNAs and block their processing to generate mature miRNAs by inhibiting Dicer enzymatic activity. The following Aims will accomplish our goal of establishing this new strategy: Aim 1. Synthesize and test bi- functional miRNA regulators. We will synthesize bi-functional regulators for miRNA-21 (miR-21) and other oncomiRs and test their inhibitory activity. Aim 2: Test the activity and specificity of the bi-functional miRNA regulator in cells. We will optimize cellular uptake of the regulator in mammalian cells. The cellular activity and off-target effects of the regulator will be evaluated in cells. This work will establish the technical foundation of a novel oncomiR regulation strategy. This unique technology will address the major obstacle encountered in current miRNA regulating methods and enhance the capability to dissect the roles of oncomiRs in cancer biology. It will significantly contribute to the advancement in our knowledge of the role played by oncomiRs in cancer and will result in the development of novel cancer therapies either directly based on the bi- modular regulators or evolved from the understanding of oncomiR functions unveiled by this new technology.",Address;Adverse effects;Affect;Affinity;Antisense Oligonucleotides;Binding;Biogenesis;Biological Assay;Biological Process;Cancer Biology;Cell physiology;Cells;Development;Dicer Enzyme;Foundations;Generations;Goals;In Vitro;Knowledge;Link;Malignant Neoplasms;Mammalian Cell;Messenger RNA;Methods;MicroRNAs;Neoplasm Metastasis;Northern Blotting;Oncogenes;Oncogenic;Pathogenesis;Play;Proteins;Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR;RNA;Regulation;Research;Role;Specificity;Technology;Testing;Therapeutic;Therapeutic Intervention;Untranslated RNA;Western Blotting;Work;base;cancer therapy;cancer type;carcinogenesis;design;improved;inhibitor/antagonist;interest;metaplastic cell transformation;new technology;next generation;novel;novel strategies;novel therapeutics;public health relevance;research and development;ribosome profiling;transcriptome sequencing;uptake,Fu-Sen Liang,John R Knowlton,184599,184599,2017-04-26T12:04:00Z,2016-05-01T12:05:00Z,2019-04-30T12:04:00Z,RFA-CA-15-002,nofo_RFA-CA-15-002,UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO,albuquerque,NM,UNITED STATES,imat,org_city,False
5R21CA212726-04,R21CA212726,9724420,2019,A molecular toolkit for the production of tyrosine phosphorylated proteins,"Project Summary Tyrosine phosphorylation can regulate protein function, and this is a cornerstone of cell signaling networks. Ty- rosine phosphorylation often becomes dysregulated in cancer and therefore, understanding the effect of phos- phorylation on protein function will be paramount to identifying therapeutic interventions in cancer. Unfortunately, an important tool in the basic research of phosphorylation – testing the effect of protein phosphorylation by com- paring the function of the phosphorylated form with an unphosphorylated form of the protein in in vitro assays – is signiﬁcantly hindered by our limited knowledge in how to make a phosphorylated protein. This project seeks to build a molecular technology, inspired by previous observations of biochemistry in cell networks, to overcome this requirement and improve the pace of basic research. The goal of this research is to build a fast, accessible and inexpensive method for producing phosphorylated and soluble proteins in a bacterial system. The goals will be achieved by: development of a molecular toolkit for the enhancement and control of precise phosphorylation on protein substrates using secondary kinase-substrate targeting approaches, testing the toolkit on a set of sub- strates, and comparing the outcome with current technologies. It is anticipated that this technology will be less expensive, more physiologically-relevant, and capable of producing a larger variety of phosphorylated forms of proteins than current molecular approaches to studying the effect of protein phosphorylation.",Amino Acid Sequence;Automobile Driving;Basic Cancer Research;Basic Science;Binding;Biochemical;Biochemistry;Biological;Biological Assay;Cells;Development;Engineering;Escherichia coli;Glutamic Acid;Goals;Grant;Human;Kinetics;Knowledge;Libraries;Malignant Neoplasms;Mass Spectrum Analysis;Measurement;Measures;Methods;Molecular;Molecular Bank;Mutate;Outcome;Pattern;Phosphoproteins;Phosphorylation;Phosphotransferases;Phosphotyrosine;Physiological;Post-Translational Protein Processing;Process;Production;Property;Proteins;Proteome;Recombinant Proteins;Recombinants;Regulation;Research;Research Personnel;SH3 Domains;Signal Transduction;Specificity;Substrate Domain;Substrate Specificity;System;Technology;Testing;Therapeutic Intervention;Thick;Tyrosine;Tyrosine Phosphorylation;Work;base;improved;in vitro Assay;polyproline;protein function;src Homology Region 2 Domain;technology development;tool;vector,Kristen M Naegle,Anowarul Amin,184556,184556,2019-07-09T12:07:00Z,2017-08-16T12:08:00Z,2021-07-31T12:07:00Z,RFA-CA-16-001,nofo_RFA-CA-16-001,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,charlottesville,VA,UNITED STATES,imat,org_city,False
5R21CA258013-02,R21CA258013,10417132,2022,Device for Preservation of Cell Free RNA in Saliva,"ABSTRACT Early detection is critical to cancer mortality reductions, and yet the breast imaging clinic visits required for these life-saving early detection programs are inaccessible to disadvantaged, remote, or quarantined populations with limited medical facility access. In fact, breast cancer surveillance programs this year have stalled by as much as 90% versus their pre-pandemic rates, resulting in risky delays in new cancer diagnosis [1]. A saliva-based test for early detection could transform today’s screening paradigms. A promising biofluid for disease detection, saliva can be self-sampled non-invasively, without trained technicians. Saliva is ideal for at-home and other non-clinical site collection; it contains a variety of analytes including exosomes, RNA, DNA, proteins, metabolites, viruses and oral microflora, and is a powerful window on health and disease. Recently, saliva samples have shown better clinical utility vs. nasal swabs for detecting COVID-19 [2]. Mounting evidence exists for oral microbiome links to systemic disease [3], and salivary biomarkers diagnose complex traits such as pediatric medical conditions, traumatic brain injury, autism, and cancer [4-7]. A commercial saliva-based test for autism is based on 32 human and microbial RNA markers [8]. In many complex trait studies, saliva is frozen as cell-free supernatant. The most prevalent saliva collection and preservation devices, although easy-to-use, preclude effective cell-free RNA and exosome analysis, since saliva samples are treated with lysis reagents resulting in mixed populations of cellular and non-cellular RNAs, increasing noise and damaging performance characteristics. Saliva collection devices that instead use membranes to separate cells suffer from inefficient recovery of critical analytes, either because they lack appropriate preservatives or because they adsorb and therefore lose, a substantial analyte fraction. To enable widespread use for disease detection, new standardized methods are needed to preserve cell-free saliva and retain the integrity of its key constituents for stable transport and downstream analysis. This project extends our past SBIR grant work and our own internal research, to develop an easy-to-use saliva collection and preservation device to stabilize cfRNA and other analytes, enabling us and others to efficiently collect high-quality clinical saliva samples. Using RT-qPCR assays and RNA isotype profiles, we will characterize salivary cfRNA integrity and stability over timelines sufficient for remote collection and transport. Armed with well-characterized RNA decay profiles, we propose an iterative design-of-experiment approach to prototype a versatile device to collect and preserve saliva at room temperature (RT), stabilizing RNA while also preventing cell lysis and bacterial growth. Our device performance validation will use prospectively collected and preserved saliva from >50 women to demonstrate stability for up 72 hours at ambient conditions. This device will standardize methods for collection, stability, and transport of saliva, key to driving virtualized sample collection and healthcare in cancer, viral, and other diagnostics, increasingly critical to a post-pandemic world.",Adoption;Automobile Driving;Biocide;Biological Assay;Biological Markers;Blood specimen;Breast Cancer Detection;COVID-19;COVID-19 detection;COVID-19 pandemic;Cells;Centrifugation;Characteristics;Childhood;Clinic;Clinic Visits;Clinical;Clinical Research;Collection;Complex;Cytolysis;DNA;Detection;Development;Devices;Diagnosis;Diagnostic;Diagnostic tests;Disadvantaged;Disease;Early Diagnosis;Facility Accesses;Feedback;Fractionation;Freezing;Future;Genomics;Grant;Growth;Health;Healthcare;Home;Hour;Human;Image;Individual;Laboratories;Life;Link;Malignant Neoplasms;Manuals;Measurement;Measures;Medical;Medicine;Membrane;Methods;Microbe;Mixed Cellular Population;Molecular;Monitor;Noise;Nucleic Acids;Office Visits;Participant;Patients;Performance;Phase;Population;Process;Property;Quarantine;RNA;RNA Decay;RNA Degradation;RNA Stability;RNA marker;Reagent;Recovery;Research;Saliva;Salivary;Sampling;Savings;Ships;Site;Small Business Innovation Research Grant;Standardization;Surveillance Program;Systemic disease;Temperature;Testing;TimeLine;Training;Traumatic Brain Injury;Validation;Venous blood sampling;Viral;Virus;Woman;Work;autism spectrum disorder;base;biomarker panel;breast imaging;cancer diagnosis;clinical diagnostics;cost;design;exosome;experimental study;innovation;iterative design;malignant breast neoplasm;microbial;microbiota;microorganism growth;mortality;nasal swab;next generation sequencing;nuclease;oral microbial community;oral microbiome;pandemic disease;participant enrollment;pathogen;point of care;post-COVID-19;preservation;prevent;programs;prospective;protein metabolite;prototype;saliva sample;salivary assay;salivary cell;sample collection;screening;trait;usability;virtual,Shivani Nautiyal,Guillermo Marquez,9568,9568,2022-07-18T12:07:00Z,2021-06-03T12:06:00Z,2023-04-03T12:04:00Z,RFA-CA-20-019,nofo_RFA-CA-20-019,"PRIME GENOMICS, INC.",mountain view,CA,UNITED STATES,imat,org_city,False

This technology will be based on a spatially-arrayed aptamer microchip and sensitive fluorescence-based optical detection techniques. The system will provide a powerful new tool for biomedical research and diagnosis of diseases and cancers. Currently, the levels of cellular proteins are inferred from cellular mRNA levels by using DNA oligonucleotide microchips. These microchips allow the detection of mRNA levels by base-pairing interactions to homologous DNA oligomers located at different sites in the microchip array. However, this indirect assay of protein levels suffers from two problems: First, mRNA levels may not accurately reflect the level of encoded protein because translation and degradation rates vary from protein to protein and are regulated in response to cell physiology. Second, post-translational modifications proteins often alter critical protein activities. This technology we propose to develop is comprised of three parts: 1) Aptamers with high-affinity and high-specifity for individual proteins. These aptamers will be designed to have ligand-dependent changes in fluorescence properties. 2) A microchip array with each array site occupied by aptamers against a different target molecule. 3) An evanescent field fluorescence detector which detects target molecules binding to aptamers at the array sites.

The proposed project involves collaboration between members of Northwestern's Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center, including researchers in Chemical Engineering, the Medical School, and Evanston Hospital. Microchannel ""tandem"" SSCP/HA is a novel mutation detection method recently developed in our laboratory, which involves the simultaneous generation and analysis of homo/heteroduplex DNA and SSCP conformers. Studies of a significant number of samples (32) indicate that tandem SSCP/HA allows for much higher-sensitivity mutation detection (100%) than SSCP alone (93%) or HA alone (75%), for p53 samples.

The p53 gene, known to be mutated in >50% of human cancers, and whose mutation status can be predictive of patient response to chemotherapy, is the important model system chosen. However, microchip-based genetic analysis technologies to be developed should be easily applied to ANY cancer-related gene.

5R33CA105514-03,R33CA105514,7108593,2006,Assaying Tyrosine Kinase Activity: A New Paradigm,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): New approaches are needed in the molecular analyses of the growth-promoting signal transduction pathways involved in the development and maintenance of cancer. The Laser Micropipet System (LMS), a new technology for the biochemical assay of kinases, holds the promise of directly assaying the activities of protein tyrosine kinases in primary patient cells. The LMS was developed for the assay of serine/threonine kinases in individual cells grown in tissue culture. This R21/R33 application proposes to expand the applications of this instrumentation to directly determine the activity of oncogenic tyrosine kinases in primary cells from patients. Assay of Bcr-Abl in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) will demonstrate the power of this tool for research, clinical, and pharmacologic applications. While this assay will be of value in the study of the biology and resistance mechanisms in CML, the studies will lay the groundwork for a new paradigm in the study of molecular mechanisms in cancer signal transduction and will have general applicability. The R21 phase of this proposal is designed to establish the feasibility of assaying Bcr-Abl activity and to demonstrate the necessary assay conditions for measurements in cells derived from a patient with CML. The specific aims are to: 1) identify and characterize a reporter of intracellular Bcr-Ab1 kinase activity, 2) define and optimize conditions for measuring Bcr-Ab1 activity in human cells, 3) compare reporter phosphorylation in cells expressing Bcr-Ab1 vs. cells lacking this kinase, and 4) demonstrate the feasibility of using primary patient cells in kinase assays. The goal of the R33 phase is to demonstrate the potential for the LMS-based kinase assay in applications for the study of the biology of pharmacologic resistance in CML, including from primary patient cells. The R33 specific aims are to: 1) develop a membrane-permeant Bcr-Ab1 kinase reporter, 2) demonstrate the ability to detect imatinib resistance in CML cell lines, 3) determine Bcr-Ab1 activity in primary cells from patients with CML and their response to pharmacologic inhibition, and 4) determine if the assay can detect the emergence of imatinib resistance in CML patients and can differentiate the mechanisms of drug resistance.",biological signal transduction;capillary electrophoresis;carcinogenesis;cell growth regulation;chronic myelogenous leukemia;clinical research;enzyme activity;enzyme mechanism;gene expression;human subject;intracellular;neoplastic cell;oncoproteins;phosphorylation;protein purification;protein tyrosine kinase;reporter genes;single cell analysis;technology /technique development,Christopher E Sims,Min-Kyung H Song,379961,379961,2006-08-01T12:08:00Z,2005-08-08T12:08:00Z,2007-06-30T12:06:00Z,PAR-01-106,nofo_PAR-01-106,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,irvine,CA,UNITED STATES,imat,org_city,False

Extant proteomics methods are limited to quantifying a few thousands of the most abundant proteins and, therefore, are unsuitable for the targeted profiling of less abundant farnesylated expression. The major goal of this application is to develop and validate a powerful technology, Tagging via Azido Substrate (TAS), for the efficient isolation of farnesylated proteins. This technology will then be applied to the proteomics analysis of farnesylated proteins in physiologically relevant models. The TAS technology involves the introduction of a synthetic azide-modified farnesyl substrate, either farnesyl azide diphosphate (FPP-azide) or farnesyl azide alcohol (F-azide-OH), which replaces the natural substrate during cellular protein farnesylation. The resulting farnesyl-azide (F-azide)-modified proteins will be affinity-purified through an azide-specific conjugation reaction (Staudinger reaction) using a phosphine capture reagent linked to photo-cleavable beads, which can then be released by UV light-induced photo-cleavage. Since affinity purification relies on covalent bonding resulting from a specific conjugation reaction between an azide and phosphine capture reagent, other proteins without the F-azide modification can be effectively removed by thorough washing. Thus, the TAS technology will allow farnesylated proteins to be isolated with high yield, high specificity, and low contamination. The initial focus of the R21 portion of this proposal is on the development of TAS technology and its application to the isolation of farnesylated proteins. These studies will be extended subsequently to geranylgeranylated proteins. The R33 proposal will aim at applications of the TAS technology to the identification of novel FTI targets.

5R33CA114149-03,R33CA114149,7283630,2007,Imaging tumor associated fibroblast activation protein,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this research is to develop a novel fibroblast activation protein (FAP) sensing near infrared fluorescence reporter for early tumor detection and tumor classification. FAP is a cell surface antigen of reactive tumor stromal fibroblasts founded in more than 90% of epithelial carcinomas, but it is absent from epithelial carcinoma cells, normal fibroblasts, and other normal human tissue. Supporting tumor stromal fibroblasts are generally localized close to tumor vasculature, which is essential for early tumor development and growth. Thus it has been chosen as a target for monoclonal antibody based tumor therapy. FAP is not only a membrane protein but also a dipeptidyl peptidase. An imaging probe to report enzymatic activity and location of FAP could be extremely useful for early tumor detection. In this application we will develop a small molecular probe with ultra-sensitivity based on a unique class of fluorogenic chromophore that has significant changes in emission at different chemical states. Specifically, the probes emit no fluorescence in their initial intact state but become brightly fluorescent after specific proteolytic reaction. The newly developed low molecular weight, well defined fluorogenic probes are expected to have several advantages for imaging: a) fast tissue distribution allowing earlier imaging after injection, b) fast clearance allowing repeated imaging, and c) high likelihood of developing key candidates into clinically useful agents. The choice of FAP is based on its importance in tumor growth, invasion, and other processes in oncogenesis. Together with recent developments in fluorescence imaging technologies, this research is expected to ultimately result in clinical imaging agents with specificity for targeted enzymes. We believe that the developed approach can be used as a platform to design a broad spectrum of activatable molecular probes to image other amino peptidases in vivo.",Carcinoma;Chemicals;Class;Classification;Clinical;Detection;Development;Dipeptidyl Peptidases;Drug or chemical Tissue Distribution;Enzymes;Fibroblasts;Fluorescence;Goals;Growth and Development function;Image;Imaging technology;Injection of therapeutic agent;Localized;Location;Malignant Epithelial Cell;Membrane Proteins;Molecular Probes;Molecular Weight;Monoclonal Antibodies;Peptide Hydrolases;Process;Reaction;Reporter;Reporting;Research;Specificity;Stromal Neoplasm;Surface Antigens;base;chromophore;design;fibroblast-activating factor;fluorescence imaging;human tissue;imaging probe;in vivo;novel;tumor;tumor growth;tumorigenesis,Ching-Hsuan Tung,James W.

5R33CA114306-02,R33CA114306,7188984,2007,Tadpole Assays for the Molecular Assessment of Cancer,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Biologists have long known that cancer cells sometimes announce their presence by shedding certain molecules into the blood. More recently, many have come to believe that some cancers might be detectable by ""signatures"", patterns of sets of molecules, perhaps normally present in the blood, but, in for certain cancers, present in higher or lower amounts than normal.

To overcome endothelial cell (EC) barriers and achieve more effective targeting and penetration into solid tumors, we shift analytical focus from the tumor cell to the vascular EC surface and its caveolae in direct contact with the circulating blood. To reduce data complexity to a meaningful subset of targetable proteins expressed on the EC surface, we will use tissue sub-cellular fractionation, novel multimodal mass spectrometric analysis, in silico subtraction, and bioinformatics interrogation of structure and function to unmask, from the >100,000 proteins in the tissue, those few intravenously accessible proteins differentially expressed on vascular endothelium in human renal tumors. This technology and overall approach has been validated in rodent solid tumors whereby new vascular targets have been uncovered permitting tumor-specific imaging, penetration, and effective radio immunotherapy (Nature, 429:629-35, 2004). But, currently very little is known about the expression of proteins in tumor neovascular endothelium, especially in human tissue.

5R33CA173373-02,R33CA173373,8738620,2014,Clinical validation of the HD-CTC fluid biopsy in early detection of lung cancer.,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Currently, the clinical diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) relies on a number of imaging modalities followed by a tissue confirmation with an invasive procedure. This process is somewhat imprecise because a patient's pathologic diagnosis after surgery may be discordant from pre-operative assessment and may contribute to poor patient prognosis since accurately staging early cancers is essential to good outcome. We hypothesize that rigorously validating the recently developed High Definition Circulating Tumor Cell (HD- CTC) Fluid Biopsy in a controlled clinical cohort of patients undergoing evaluation for lung cancer will improve the accuracy of detection and prognosis in early-stage, malignant nodules of the lung with non-small cell lung cancer histology. We will capitalize on NIH-supported proof of concept data, which has demonstrated that the HD-CTC Fluid Biopsy is capable of detecting disease derived cells in the majority of patients at the time of diagnosis. These data now motivate us to investigate the performance of the assay ""the day before diagnosis"" with the expectation of achieving similar results in a more realistic, prospectively designed, clinical study with matched controls consisting of patients who have non-malignant lung nodules. Our aim is to accurately establish the test characteristics of the HD-CTC fluid biopsy in a group of patients undergoing evaluation for lung cancer and to identify those patients with malignant nodules that have detectable HD-CTCs to determine whether the fluid biopsy can augment 1) clinical staging prior to definitive treatment and 2) prognosis after definitive diagnosis and treatment. We will significantly enhance the test by developing single cell molecular analysis to provide definitive characterization. Integrating non-invasive, reliable and accurate circulating biomarkers with the current standard of care will not only allow for the development of more accurate clinical prediction models that are cost-effective, but may also augment our understanding of tumor biology and metastasis using a clinical, in vivo model of early non-small cell lung cancer.",Advanced Development;Biological Assay;Biological Markers;Biology;Biopsy;Blood Tests;Cancer Histology;Caring;Cells;Characteristics;Clinic;Clinical;Clinical Data;Clinical Research;Data;Detection;Development;Diagnosis;Diagnostic;Disease;Emerging Technologies;Enrollment;Epithelial Cells;Evaluation;Fluorescent in Situ Hybridization;Genome;Genomics;Image;Investigation;Liquid substance;Lung nodule;Malignant - descriptor;Malignant Neoplasms;Malignant neoplasm of lung;Malignant neoplasm of pancreas;Malignant neoplasm of prostate;Measures;Medical;Methods;Modeling;Molecular;Molecular Analysis;Morphology;Neoplasm Circulating Cells;Neoplasm Metastasis;Nodule;Non-Malignant;Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma;Operative Surgical Procedures;Outcome;Pathologic;Patients;Performance;Phase;Positron-Emission Tomography;Procedures;Process;Prospective Studies;Proteins;Publishing;Recurrence;Relative (related person);Research Design;Sampling;Specificity;Staging;Staging System;System;Techniques;Technology;Testing;Time;Tissues;Translations;Tumor Biology;United States National Institutes of Health;Validation;Venous blood sampling;anticancer research;case control;clinical Diagnosis;clinically relevant;cohort;cost effective;design;disease characteristic;disorder subtype;expectation;imaging modality;immunocytochemistry;improved;in vivo;in vivo Model;insight;lung cancer screening;malignant breast neoplasm;outcome forecast;performance tests;prognostic;public health relevance;response;standard of care;tool;translational study;tumor;tumor metabolism;tumor progression,Peter Kuhn,Matthew R Young,521105,521105,2014-08-26T12:08:00Z,2013-09-20T12:09:00Z,2014-12-31T12:12:00Z,RFA-CA-13-002,nofo_RFA-CA-13-002,"SCRIPPS RESEARCH INSTITUTE, THE",la jolla,CA,UNITED STATES,imat,org_city,False

However, their widespread use is limited by a number of difficulties in manufacturing such cells. Current manufacturing processes are complicated, costly, and can only produce cells for small populations. Additionally, they have large production variations. As a result, different patients receive very different products or treatments. The long-term goal is to develop a novel technology to address the CAR T manufacturing challenge. Toward this goal, the team has developed a proof- of-concept technology termed stress-free intra-tubular cell culture technology (SFIT). SFIT provides cells uniform, highly reproducible, controllable, and cell-friendly microenvironments, resulting in extremely high culture efficiency and consistency. SFIT produces cells for each patient with one small conical tube, significantly reducing production cost and increasing production capability. The purpose of this project is to further develop and validate this technology and the associated methods to make it ready for the final translational challenge. Leveraging sound preliminary studies and a diverse team of experts, the specific aims are to (1) validate SFIT for culturing T cells from a wide range of donors and for culturing various T cell subtypes, (2) further develop and validate methods for transducing T cells with lentivirus and γ-retrovirus in SFIT, and (3) further develop and validate the SFIT-based single-conical-tube-device for producing autologous CAR T cells. The project will build on the team’s strong preliminary work and include mathematical modeling, prototype device design, extensive T cell culturing, exome-Seq and RNA-Seq data analyses, in vivo testing, statistical analyses and comparisons, and partnership with ADS BIOTEC, a company that designs, builds, and sells instruments for processing human cells. With the completion of this project, simple, disposable, affordable devices for the scalable, cost-effective and consistent production of autologous CAR T cells are expected. This technology can also be scaled up for producing allogeneic CAR T cells in large scales if needed. This technology will not only make CAR T cells broadly accessible, but also make the product much more consistent and predictable. Based on 2012-2014 data, approximately 38.5% of the human population will be diagnosed with some type of cancer during their lifetime.

6R21CA258013-03,R21CA258013,10888835,2022,Device for Preservation of Cell Free RNA in Saliva,"ABSTRACT Early detection is critical to cancer mortality reductions, and yet the breast imaging clinic visits required for these life-saving early detection programs are inaccessible to disadvantaged, remote, or quarantined populations with limited medical facility access. In fact, breast cancer surveillance programs this year have stalled by as much as 90% versus their pre-pandemic rates, resulting in risky delays in new cancer diagnosis [1]. A saliva-based test for early detection could transform today’s screening paradigms. A promising biofluid for disease detection, saliva can be self-sampled non-invasively, without trained technicians. Saliva is ideal for at-home and other non-clinical site collection; it contains a variety of analytes including exosomes, RNA, DNA, proteins, metabolites, viruses and oral microflora, and is a powerful window on health and disease. Recently, saliva samples have shown better clinical utility vs. nasal swabs for detecting COVID-19 [2]. Mounting evidence exists for oral microbiome links to systemic disease [3], and salivary biomarkers diagnose complex traits such as pediatric medical conditions, traumatic brain injury, autism, and cancer [4-7]. A commercial saliva-based test for autism is based on 32 human and microbial RNA markers [8]. In many complex trait studies, saliva is frozen as cell-free supernatant. The most prevalent saliva collection and preservation devices, although easy-to-use, preclude effective cell-free RNA and exosome analysis, since saliva samples are treated with lysis reagents resulting in mixed populations of cellular and non-cellular RNAs, increasing noise and damaging performance characteristics. Saliva collection devices that instead use membranes to separate cells suffer from inefficient recovery of critical analytes, either because they lack appropriate preservatives or because they adsorb and therefore lose, a substantial analyte fraction. To enable widespread use for disease detection, new standardized methods are needed to preserve cell-free saliva and retain the integrity of its key constituents for stable transport and downstream analysis. This project extends our past SBIR grant work and our own internal research, to develop an easy-to-use saliva collection and preservation device to stabilize cfRNA and other analytes, enabling us and others to efficiently collect high-quality clinical saliva samples. Using RT-qPCR assays and RNA isotype profiles, we will characterize salivary cfRNA integrity and stability over timelines sufficient for remote collection and transport. Armed with well-characterized RNA decay profiles, we propose an iterative design-of-experiment approach to prototype a versatile device to collect and preserve saliva at room temperature (RT), stabilizing RNA while also preventing cell lysis and bacterial growth. Our device performance validation will use prospectively collected and preserved saliva from >50 women to demonstrate stability for up 72 hours at ambient conditions. This device will standardize methods for collection, stability, and transport of saliva, key to driving virtualized sample collection and healthcare in cancer, viral, and other diagnostics, increasingly critical to a post-pandemic world.",,Shivani Nautiyal,Guillermo Marquez,218184,218184,2024-08-01T12:08:00Z,2021-06-03T12:06:00Z,2025-05-31T12:05:00Z,RFA-CA-20-019,nofo_RFA-CA-20-019,"NOWDIAGNOSTICS, INC.",springdale,AR,UNITED STATES,imat,org_city,False
6R44CA133987-05,R44CA133987,8637449,2013,Single Molecule Fiber Arrays for the Detection of Low Abundance Proteins,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The aim of this project is to develop a new technology that can be used to detect very low concentrations (femtomolar and below) of proteins that are diagnostic for cancer. Presently, early diagnosis of cancer is limited by the fact that the limits of detections (LOD) of available technologies, such as ELISA, are higher than the circulating concentrations of low abundance proteins that could indicate the onset of disease. This program would broaden and strengthen the use a novel fiber optic array single molecule detection technology for extremely high sensitivity measurement of cancer markers. This technology is digital in nature, i.e., individual molecules are quantified by their presence (""on"" signal) or their absence (""off"" signal). By focusing detection at the single molecule level, dramatic improvements in sensitivity are achieved for proteins. Phase I of this project demonstrated that single molecule detection makes it possible to detect concentrations of proteins at levels a thousand times lower than ELISA. Using single molecule detection, prostate specific antigen (PSA) was detected in serum at concentrations less than 1 femtomolar; current immunoanalyzers have an LOD of about 3 picomolar for PSA. The Phase II project has three specific aims that would build on these proof-of-principal experiments to broaden and strengthen the use of the technique for detection of cancer protein markers, and to move the technology closer to commercialization for use by medical researchers and clinicians. First, the ultra-sensitive PSA assay will be used to detect the marker in human clinical samples, specifically to measure the levels of PSA in prostate cancer patients who have undergone radical prostatectomy. Current technologies cannot detect PSA in these samples; this technology could enable the early detection of the return of PSA in serum, which would indicate residual disease. Second, the technology will be expanded to cover more classes of proteins, such as fusion proteins and post-translational modifications, to enable its broader implementation. Third, methods will be developed to measure panels of proteins at low concentrations using small sample volumes. These panels would enable the diagnosis of difficulty to detect diseases, such as ovarian cancer, with greater sensitivity and specificity. The long term objective of this research is to establish a new standard in high sensitivity detection of biological molecules (proteins, peptides, RNA, cells) using instrumentation that would be widely employed in both academic and clinical laboratories. Such an innovation would enable researchers to detect cancer markers at unprecedented levels for early diagnostic applications, and would facilitate the discovery of new low abundance cancer markers. This long term goal satisfies several aspects of the mission of the NIH, in particular, to develop innovative research strategies towards improving the diagnosis, prevention and cure of human diseases. The early diagnosis of cancer is determined by the ability of the clinical oncologist to detect the disease. Quanterix is proposing to develop a technology that would enable clinicians to detect very low concentrations of proteins in blood and, therefore, enable the early diagnosis of disease. This technology has the potential to help medical researchers and doctors to identify and detect many more early cancer diagnostic markers and improve outcomes for patients.",Area;Biological;Biological Assay;Biological Markers;Biological Models;Blood;Cancer Detection;Cancer Diagnostics;Cancer Patient;Cells;Chimeric Proteins;Clinical;Complex;Computer software;Detection;Diagnosis;Diagnostic;Disease;Early Diagnosis;Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay;Fiber;Fiber Optics;Goals;Human;Immunoassay;Individual;Laboratories;Malignant Neoplasms;Malignant neoplasm of ovary;Malignant neoplasm of prostate;Measurement;Measures;Medical;Methods;Mission;Molecular;Nature;Oncologist;Onset of illness;Operative Surgical Procedures;Outcome;Patients;Peptides;Phase;Post-Translational Protein Processing;Prevention;Prostate specific antigen measurement;Prostate-Specific Antigen;Proteins;RNA;Radical Prostatectomy;Reading;Reagent;Reproducibility;Research;Research Personnel;Residual Tumors;Sampling;Sensitivity and Specificity;Serum;Signal Transduction;Techniques;Technology;Time;TimeLine;Translating;United States National Institutes of Health;base;cancer diagnosis;commercialization;digital;human disease;improved;innovation;instrument;instrumentation;meetings;new technology;next generation;novel;programs;protein complex;protein profiling;prototype;research study;single molecule;small molecule,David C Duffy,Patricia A Weber,713497,713497,2013-05-22T12:05:00Z,2008-08-01T12:08:00Z,2014-04-30T12:04:00Z,RFA-CA-08-011,nofo_RFA-CA-08-011,QUANTERIX CORPORATION,billerica,MA,UNITED STATES,imat,org_city,False
7R21CA083232-02,R21CA083232,6589708,2000,APTAMER BASED DETECTOR TO QUANTIFY MACROMOLECULES,"DESCRIPTION: (Applicant's Description) We propose to develop a technology to simultaneously detect and quantify large numbers individual proteins and post-translationally modified proteins. This technology will be based on a spatially-arrayed aptamer microchip and sensitive fluorescence-based optical detection techniques. The system will provide a powerful new tool for biomedical research and diagnosis of diseases and cancers. Currently, the levels of cellular proteins are inferred from cellular mRNA levels by using DNA oligonucleotide microchips. These microchips allow the detection of mRNA levels by base-pairing interactions to homologous DNA oligomers located at different sites in the microchip array. However, this indirect assay of protein levels suffers from two problems: First, mRNA levels may not accurately reflect the level of encoded protein because translation and degradation rates vary from protein to protein and are regulated in response to cell physiology. Second, post-translational modifications proteins often alter critical protein activities. This technology we propose to develop is comprised of three parts: 1) Aptamers with high-affinity and high-specifity for individual proteins. These aptamers will be designed to have ligand-dependent changes in fluorescence properties. 2) A microchip array with each array site occupied by aptamers against a different target molecule. 3) An evanescent field fluorescence detector which detects target molecules binding to aptamers at the array sites. Our proposal includes plans for: 1) selection of aptamers that can discriminate between different post-translational modifications of the same protein; 2) development of fluorescence-based techniques for detecting oligonucleotide:protein interactions; 3) design and construction of an optimized fluorescence detector; 4) scaling up methods to allow large numbers of independent aptamer selections against different proteins; 5) construction of a prototype protein chip.",macromolecule; messenger RNA; microprocessor /microchip; oligonucleotides; posttranslational modifications; proteins; technology /technique development,Martin J Stanton,,150995,150995,2002-09-09T12:09:00Z,2000-06-01T12:06:00Z,2003-05-31T12:05:00Z,PAR-99-100,nofo_PAR-99-100,ARCHEMIX CORPORATION,cambridge,MA,UNITED STATES,imat,org_city,False
7R21CA112149-02,R21CA112149,7472827,2005,Automated Cell Preparation in Tubes for 3D Microscopy,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): 3D microscopy represents a powerful new cell analysis tool for early detection and diagnosis of cancer, but its future use may be limited because methods for preparation of samples are cumbersome, inefficient, labor intensive and generally imprecise. Current methods for cytological sample collection are manual and distributed in nature through various physicians' office laboratories and local hospitals, with the actual analysis being centralized at regional clinical laboratories. Among the cytological specimens are sputum, gynecological and colorectal scrapes, fine needle aspirates, urinary tract, and gastrointestinal samples. We propose the development of a new automated system that will transform these difficult and messy clinical specimens into an optimal format for 3D microscopy morphological and molecular analysis. The model and method we propose is comprised of three sequential steps. First, at the distributed site, an automated sample processor dissociates and fixes cells and debris for shipment in an automation compatible canister. Second, after shipment to a centralized clinical laboratory, the specimen canisters are loaded into an automatic processor that performs cleanup (debris removal), specimen/assay specific staining (and counterstaining), and finally embedding of cells of interest in glass microcapillary tubes (about 50 mu m ID), with cells being spaced at regular intervals (about 200 mu m) within a tube. This preparation format is uniquely suited for integration with multiple 3D imaging platforms for true 3D volumetric assessment of cell morphology and molecular probe and/or stain density distribution. The proposed system also enables use of cytometric flow sorting for enrichment of cells of interest at an intermediate stage of the sample preparation process. The potential impact to improved human health through rapid diagnostic screening will be illustrated using a high impact emerging technology, optical tomography. In summary, the aim of the proposed project is to develop, design, and build a complete sample processing system that automates the process of sample cleanup, assay specific staining, and mounting of cells into glass microcapillary tubes, and a tube positioning and rotation scanner mechanism for 3D microscopy analysis of cell morphology for the early detection of cancer.",bioimaging /biomedical imaging;biomedical automation;cell morphology;clinical research;cytodiagnosis;early diagnosis;flow cytometry;high throughput technology;human tissue;molecular probes;neoplasm /cancer diagnosis;technology /technique development;three dimensional imaging /topography;tissue /cell preparation,Deirdre R.

The assay proposed relies on an electro catalytic process involving two transition-metal ions that reports on biomolecular complexation events. Because the reporter system responds to changes in the electrostatics of an electrode surface, it will enable the analysis of nucleic acids/protein and peptide/protein complexes. The proposed project has 3 specific aims: 1) electro catalytic detection of DNA repair proteins implicated in cancer using DNA-modified electrodes; 2) optimization of electro catalytic detection and multiplexed analysis of cellular DNA repair activities, and 3) development of a generalized electro catalytic protein detection method using prostate cancer biomarkers. The electro catalytic protein detection system described is advantageous because it will allow the analysis and discrimination of multiprotein complexes in addition to uncomplexed analytes and will have high selectivity and specificity. Additionally, the protein detection assays will be conducted using nanoelectrodes that will allow multiplexed detection of panels of different biomolecular targets.",DNA binding protein;DNA repair;biomarker;biotechnology;carbonates;electrochemistry;electrodes;high throughput technology;nanotechnology;oligonucleotides;prostate neoplasms;prostate specific antigen;protein quantitation /detection;synthetic nucleotide;technology /technique development,Shana O Kelley,John R Knowlton,105462,105462,2007-05-02T12:05:00Z,2005-06-21T12:06:00Z,2008-05-31T12:05:00Z,RFA-CA-05-002,nofo_RFA-CA-05-002,UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO,toronto,ON,CANADA,imat,org_city,False
7R21CA114852-03,R21CA114852,7365035,2006,Profile serum proteins by glycopeptide capture and LC-MS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancers develop over a period of several years and they are characterized by molecular changes prior to invasion and metastasis. Development of a technology that enables screening of cancer from body fluids could permit cancer detection at early and treatable stages. It is expected that the composition of the serum proteome contains valuable information about the state of the human body in health and disease, and that this information can be extracted via quantitative proteomic measurements. Suitable proteomic techniques need to be sensitive, reproducible and robust, to detect potential biomarkers below the level of highly expressed proteins, to generate data sets that are comparable between experiments and laboratories, and have high throughput to support studies with sufficient statistical power. In this proposal, we will develop a method for high throughput quantitative analysis of serum proteins. It consists of the selective isolation of the peptides that are N-linked glycosylated in the intact protein using solid-phase extraction of glycopeptides (SPEG) on a robotic workstation, the analysis of these now de-glycosylated peptides by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS), and the comparative analysis of the resulting patterns. By focusing selectively on a few formerly N-linked glycopeptides per serum protein, the complexity of the analyte sample is significantly reduced, and the sensitivity, reproducibility, and throughput of serum proteome analysis are increased compared with the analysis of total tryptic peptides from unfractionated samples. We will explore the feasibility to identify cancer-specific serum proteins in the background of normal variation using a carcinogen-induced skin cancer mouse model. The specific aims are: 1) To develop chemistries and protocols for an automatic robotic system to isolate N-linked glycopeptides from serum in a high throughput and highly reproducible fashion; 2) To develop efficient and reproducible procedures for LC-MS analyses, and sequence identification of discriminatory peptides by tandem mass spectrometry; 3) To explore the feasibility of this method for the identification of distinctive serum peptides specific to cancer-bearing mice in the background of normal variations. If successful, the proposed research could subsequently be used for profiling human serum samples from cancer patients and normal individuals to identify the cancer-associated proteins in serum. The identified biomarkers will open a new paradigm for performing screening and detection of human cancer at early stage and for clinical therapeutic management.",biomarker;biomedical automation;biotechnology;blood proteins;glycopeptides;high throughput technology;laboratory mouse;liquid chromatography mass spectrometry;neoplasm /cancer diagnosis;proteomics;technology /technique development,Hui Zhang,John R Knowlton,113491,113491,2007-04-05T12:04:00Z,2005-06-13T12:06:00Z,2008-05-31T12:05:00Z,RFA-CA-05-002,nofo_RFA-CA-05-002,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,baltimore,MD,UNITED STATES,imat,org_city,False
7R21CA116060-03,R21CA116060,7569614,2006,REVERSIBLE PROMOTER-INSERTION FOR IN VIVO STUDIES OF MELANOMA,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is commonly accepted that the processes underlying the development of cancer are best modeled in vivo. A plethora of methods have been developed for genetic dissection of biological processes in somatic cells in culture; however, the adaptation of these techniques to in vivo use has been very limited. Our earlier experience indicates that reversible promoter-insertion mutagenesis offers a number of advantages over the currently used forward genetics techniques for cultured cells. The most important benefits are the dominant nature of the mutations, and the ease of identifying the affected gene and establishing the causal link between the mutation and the phenotype. The principal limitation for the adaptation of this technique to in vivo studies is the delivery of the insertional mutagen (typically, a retroviral vector) to the desired cell type. Based on our recent experience and published data from others, we propose a method to circumvent this limitation via the use of specially engineered transposon vectors. We propose to apply our technique to study the genetic events underlying melanoma development. We will screen for genetic events that cooperate with oncogenic Ras (commonly found in melanomas) in this process. We will confirm the properties of the proposed insertional mutagens in culture and then proceed to establish mouse strains suitable for mutagenesis. Upon verifying the properties of our constructs in vivo, we will selectively mutagenize melanocytes in transgenic animals and will test the functional link between tumorigenesis and the inserted promoter. Confirmed hits will be the subject of future investigation, while the technique itself will become available for dissection of various biological phenomena in general and aspects of tumorigenesis, in particular.",biomarker;biotechnology;cell line;gene mutation;genetically modified animals;guanine nucleotide binding protein;laboratory mouse;melanocyte;melanoma;neoplasm /cancer genetics;oncogenes;technology /technique development;tetracyclines;tissue /cell culture;transfection /expression vector;transposon /insertion element,Eugene S Kandel,Jennifer A.

7R21CA123018-03,R21CA123018,7797760,2007,Epigenetic Targeting in Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hypermethylation of promoter CpG islands plays a prominent role in cancer. In partnership with alterations in histone acetylation/methylation, this epigenetic event establishes a repressive chromatin structure that leads to silencing of key cancer-related genes. The occurrence of DNA methylation within the genome is not random, but rather patterns of methylation are generated that are gene and tumor type specific. How DNA methylation patterns are established is still poorly understood. Since various transcriptional factors or regulators are found in association with DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) in vivo, we hypothesize that: 1) Oncogenic transcription factors can recruit DNMTs to target gene promoters and define a unique epigenetic signature in tumor cells; 2) Dissecting such complex epigenetic hierarchy will identify novel molecular targets for diagnosis, prognosis and therapeutic intervention. To test our hypothesis, we developed a high throughput technique for genome wide analysis of DNA methylation associated with specific proteins such as histones, transcription factors or any DNA binding proteins. The new approach named ChlP-Chop-DMH will combine both genome wide location analysis (also known as ChlP-on-Chip) and Differential Methylation Hybridization (DMH) analysis, two emerging technologies used in epigenetic research. The proposed method has distinct advantages over current protocols: first, this method directly examines the in vivo interaction of specific proteins with methylated DNA throughout the genome; second, this method may uncover novel biological properties of transcription factors; third, this method can be applied to discover novel epigenetic biomarkers relevant to tumorigenesis. In preliminary studies, we have verified the utility of this method with methylated histone H3 at lysine 9 and lysine 4 in human cancer cells. In the R21 phase, we will continue minor refinement of the method and pursue three aims: 1) Improve and optimize the ChlP-Chop-DMH method for analyzing genome wide association of DNA methylation with histone modification; 2) Utilize the proposed method to investigate the association of DNA methylation with chromatin remodeling factors: 3) Show proof-of-concept using the array to examine primary non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHLs). In this development phase we will focus on the sensitivity, reproducibility and accuracy of the proposed method. In the R33 phase, our goal is to utilize the technology to test biological hypotheses. We will fully implement the method and pursue these aims: 1) Discover epigenetic target genes associated with known oncogenic transcription factors c-Myc and BCL6: 2) Validate the identified epigenetic targets and investigate the regulatory role of the associated oncogenic transcription factors.

7R21CA173303-03,R21CA173303,8819875,2013,Controlled premature termination of translation to generate designated truncated,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many diseases, including several forms of cancer, depend on the inappropriate expression of pathological proteins, such as oncogenes. Frequently, the structure-function of these proteins belies a modular construction, with an essential functional domain in the C-terminal portion of the protein (for example the transactivation domain of a transcription factor). Mutants lacking the C-terminal domain can have altered and antagonistic functions, and in some cases they can behave as dominant- negative variants. Such variants are sometimes naturally generated by alternative splicing/polyadenylation. However, these are not always present or not easily activatable. A method to specifically induce these dominant negative variants would be highly desirable and have a significant therapeutic potential in a broad range of diseases, including cancer. In order to generate a pre-designed, desirable truncated variant instead of the pathological one we propose development of a novel universal methodology, based on a brand new design of antisense molecules that are able to redirect termination of translation from the normally translated full-length ORF to an upstream specified location. These Self-Wrapping Antisense Translation Termination (SWATT) compounds work by introducing an insurmountable steric block that cannot be resolved by the helicase activity of incoming translating ribosomes, which can normally unwind extensive secondary structures within the pre-mRNA. This roadblock would thus result in ribosome drop-off and expression of a shorter, C-terminally truncated variant. We will validate the viability of this novel strategy by assessing SWATT compounds on specifically designed reporter luciferase constructs and, eventually, by showing their biological relevance using Notch signaling as a proof-of-principle substrate in cancer cells. Induction of a C-Terminal dominant negative version of Notch, lacking the intracellular signaling domain, should inhibit Notch signaling by engaging Notch ligands in non-productive interactions, and thus prevent its oncogenic functions. SWATT compounds will provide an additional tool to dissect the structure-function properties of proteins in their physiological contexts, and they wil constitute the basis for a novel therapeutic approach in the treatment of cancer and other diseases.",,Luca Cartegni,John R Knowlton,190139,190139,2014-05-07T12:05:00Z,2012-09-20T12:09:00Z,2015-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-12-002,nofo_RFA-CA-12-002,"RUTGERS, THE STATE UNIV OF N.J.",piscataway,NJ,UNITED STATES,imat,org_city,False
7R21CA177395-03,R21CA177395,9188276,2015,A novel single-molecule telomere characterization technology for analyzing cancer,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Single-telomere-specific (TTAGGG)n tract lengths and instabilities cannot be measured globally using current methods; the ability to do so would be a major, transformative addition to the arsenal of tools for analyzing critical telomere loss an telomere elongation events in cancer. The shortest telomere or a small subset of the shortest telomeres in a cell will determine the onset of senescence, apoptosis, or genome instability; single (TTAGGG)n tracts are crucial for the function of telomeres and the biological effects of telomere attrition and dysfunction. Telomere loss, breakage, fusion, and rejoining are highly elevated in cancer, but current methods for detecting and measuring these mutational events at the molecular level are limited and low-throughput. The technology we propose to develop here would permit quantitative, single- allele-resolution measurements of telomere length and instability, enabling unprecedented insights into the role(s) telomere loss, telomere breakage/re-joining, and telomerase or ALT dependent telomere elongation play in carcinogenesis, including mechanistic insights into molecular events mediating these processes and translational insights for the potential prognostic and tumor stratification applicability of the methods. In this method, input genomic DNA is labeled with fluorescent dyes specific for (TTAGGG)n sequences and for linked subtelomeric DNA. The labeled individual DNA fragments are linearized (stretched) and imaged in the nano-channels of Bionano Genomics system at very high throughput. The lengths of the telomere are measured accurately and the distances between probes in the subtelomere region are determined accurately to infer the identity of the telomere. Our goals for this R21 study are to establish feasibility for (1) high-throughput single-molecule detection and quantitation of (TTAGGG)n tracts in genomic DNA samples and (2) subtelomere probe development and efficient co-labeling of telomeres and subtelomeres in the context of total genomic DNA, including conversion of the labeled DNA to double- stranded DNA suitable for nano-channel analysis; and (3) proof-of-principle results for the technology and its applicability for cancer research using data generated and analyzed for a normal and a cancer cell line. There are significant technical challenges inherent in this early-stage technology development project, but the extraordinary payoff for cancer research will be a high-throughput ability to probe mechanisms of telomere length regulation and telomere mutation at single-telomere resolution, in small (ultimately single-cell) samples of both dividing and non-dividing cells.",,Harold Riethman; Ming Xiao,Jerry Li,125192,125192,2016-01-21T12:01:00Z,2014-05-13T12:05:00Z,2017-04-30T12:04:00Z,RFA-CA-13-001,nofo_RFA-CA-13-001,OLD DOMINION UNIVERSITY,norfolk,VA,UNITED STATES,imat,org_city,False
7R21CA193064-02,R21CA193064,9114273,2015,Cellular biofactories for therapeutic protein synthesis in tumor microenvironment,"﻿ DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): T cells undergo an intelligent decision-making process based on the inhibitory and excitatory chemotactic inputs; and extravagate to the tumor microenvironment through solid tissue barriers. Investigators' long-term goal, to be pursued in R33 phase, is to develop T cells into a platform vector technology for active drug- transport to the solid tumors. In this R21 application, their objective is to engineer a robust mechanism to transform autologous T cells into biofactories for autonomous synthesis of cytocidal secretory proteins upon stimulation by the tumor cells. Autonomous synthesis of Protein-of-Interest (PoI) with spatiotemporal resolution will enable targeting of tumor burden with cellular resolution and molecular specificity. Their central hypothesis is that T cells can be genetically encoded for robust modulation and biosynthesis of therapeutic proteins at the tumor site. They have chosen ovarian cancer that expresses Folate Receptor alpha (FRa) as disease model, and an apoptotic protein for its cytotoxic therapeutic value. However, the rationale for developing T cells as protein biofactories is that this is a platform technology and their specificity can be modified to target any cancer and autonomously synthesize any PoI in situ. To aid this R21 effort, they have developed cell lines expressing bioluminescent and fluorescent reporters expressed only when stimulated by tumor cells. With following specific aims, they will advance this project towards its goals: (1) To develop robust control on biosynthesis of protein-of-interest (PoI); (2) To develop T cells as biofactories for autonomous secretion of antitumor apoptotic protein. It is expected that this R21 phase will lead to T cells that will not activate in healthy tissues (enhanced safety) and hyperactivate specifically in the tumor microenvironment (enhanced efficacy). The impact of this research will also be felt on ongoing T-cell therapy trials by reducing the incidences of graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD). This pioneering approach builds upon ongoing T-cell immunotherapy trials, which are currently limited to control minimal residual disease (MRD) and is administered after chemotherapy. Proposed research is transformative, firstly because it will expand the scope of T-cell engineering to replace systemic chemotherapies. This will then be used for reduction of tumor burden rather than keeping MRD in check. Secondly, therapeutic proteins of non-human origin are efficiently degraded and removed by the immune system. This is a barrier to their in vivo application. The use of autologous T cells for biosynthesis of therapeutic proteins at the target site will eliminate any immunogenicity issues. Unusually high impact is expected because the specificity of T cells can be redirected towards the surface markers on different cancers and therefore be used to target multitude of cancers.",Address;Amidohydrolases;Anabolism;Antigen Targeting;Antigens;Apoptotic;Autologous;Cell Line;Cytoplasm;Decision Making;Development;Disease model;Drug Delivery Systems;Drug Transport;Engineering;Foundations;Future;Goals;IL6 gene;Immune system;Immunosuppressive Agents;Immunotherapy;In Situ;Incidence;Injection of therapeutic agent;Intercellular Fluid;Lead;Malignant Neoplasms;Malignant neoplasm of ovary;Mission;Molecular;Penicillin G;Permeability;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phase;Process;Prodrugs;Protein Biosynthesis;Proteins;Public Health;Regulation;Reporter;Reporting;Research;Research Personnel;Residual Neoplasm;Resolution;Response Elements;Safety;Site;Solid;Solid Neoplasm;Specificity;Surface;System;T cell response;T cell therapy;T-Cell Development;T-Cell Immunologic Specificity;T-Lymphocyte;Technology;Therapeutic;Therapy trial;Tissues;Transgenes;Tumor Antigens;Tumor Burden;Work;amidase;base;cellular engineering;chemotherapy;chimeric antigen receptor;cytotoxic;graft vs host disease;human FOLR1 protein;immunogenicity;in vivo;interest;nanoparticle;neoplastic cell;nuclear factors of activated T-cells;pressure;prevent;promoter;public health relevance;secretory protein;spatiotemporal;success;therapeutic protein;tumor;tumor microenvironment;tumor specificity;vector,Parijat Bhatnagar,Tawnya C Mckee,271339,271339,2015-08-12T12:08:00Z,2015-06-01T12:06:00Z,2018-05-31T12:05:00Z,RFA-CA-14-003,nofo_RFA-CA-14-003,SRI INTERNATIONAL,menlo park,CA,UNITED STATES,imat,org_city,False
7R21CA196418-04,R21CA196418,9566479,2017,"Multiplexed, Quantitative Fluorescence Imaging in Tumor Sections","﻿ DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Precision medicine for cancer requires knowledge of the driver mutations in a particular patient's tumor. Recent single cell genetic studies have shown that driver mutations and cancer cell subtype are highly heterogeneous within a single patient. Thus, clinicians will need to employ experimental methods that allow observation of a variety of molecular analytes across many individual cells within a particular patient's tumor section in situ. Current tumor section analyses are not highly multiplexed and typically remain limited to ~4-5 analytes, or 7 with multi-spectral imaging. Recent technologies have pushed this number into 30s-60s, but they require expensive equipment and/or reagents, sophisticated analyses or markedly increased assay time, all of which would preclude their practical use in many clinical pathology and preclinical research laboratories. Thus, there remains a significant need for technologies that multiplex measurements in tumor sections but are widely accessible and cost-effective. We focus on addressing this need with a readily-adoptable but novel multi- spectral fluorescence-based method. It is based on the hypothesis that the power of combinatorics can be harnessed to vastly increase the number of quantifiable analytes in a mixture by permuting the wide array of available fluorophores in new ways. We term our approach combinatorial fluorescence with spectral imaging (CoFSI). CoFSI only requires the ability to perform multi-channel fluorescence excitation and emission spectral scanning, which is widely available and easy to implement in most plate/slide readers and many microscopes. Data analysis involves a straightforward, fast computational technique called linear unmixing. Preliminary simulation studies suggest that the concentrations of 123 different CoFSI probes constructed from 16 existing fluorescent proteins can be estimated simultaneously with good accuracy and precision across 3 orders of concentration magnitude with a large number of excitation channels, and 48 probes with 6 excitation channels. Similar simulation studies constrained by available tumor section imaging equipment and Alexa dyes suggest 25 simultaneous measurements are possible. Initial pilot experiments demonstrate that seven different CoFSI probe levels in a mixture can be measured both accurately and precisely using only the blue-yellow part of the spectrum. This proposal further tests the limits of CoFSI experimentally, and applies CoFSI to tumor section imaging, with two Aims: (1) Quantify the Levels of 48 Fluorescent Probes in a Mixture Simultaneously; and (2) Quantify the Spatial Distribution of 25 Analytes in Tumor Sections. If successful, CoFSI can increase quantitative fluorescence multiplexing at least ~5 to 10-fold while relying on standard lab resources and straightforward analyses. CoFSI is also feasibly compatible with other difficult-to-multiplex technologies such as high content screening, live-cell imaging, and in vivo rodent imaging, and thus may have broad impact.",Address;Adopted;Antibodies;Antigens;Architecture;Area;Basic Science;Biological Assay;Biological Markers;Biopsy Specimen;Breast Cancer cell line;Cells;Chemicals;Classification;Clinic;Clinical Data;Clinical Pathology;Combinatorics;Computational Technique;Cytometry;Data;Data Analyses;Diagnostic;Dyes;Epitopes;Equipment;Escherichia coli;Fluorescence;Fluorescent Probes;Genetic study;Image;In Situ;In Situ Hybridization;Individual;Knowledge;Label;Laboratory Research;Measurement;Measures;Methods;Microscope;Molecular;Mus;Nucleic Acids;Oncologist;Patients;Pharmacologic Substance;Principal Investigator;Proteins;Reader;Reagent;Research;Resolution;Resources;Rodent;Sample Size;Sampling;Scanning;Science;Slide;Spatial Distribution;Staining method;Stains;System;Techniques;Technology;Testing;Time;Tissues;Translating;Xenograft procedure;Yeasts;actionable mutation;base;cancer cell;cell type;clinical decision-making;clinically relevant;combinatorial;cost effective;data acquisition;deep sequencing;drug development;experimental study;fluorescence imaging;fluorophore;imaging modality;imaging probe;improved;in vivo;insight;live cell imaging;malignant breast neoplasm;novel;optical spectra;outcome forecast;pre-clinical;pre-clinical research;precision oncology;public health relevance;research and development;screening;simulation;spectrograph;treatment response;tumor;tumor heterogeneity;tumor microenvironment;tumor xenograft,Marc R.

7R21CA202831-04,R21CA202831,9753479,2018,Novel Bi-functional Inhibitors Blocking OncomiR Biogenesis,"﻿ DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this proposal is to develop a new class of selective miRNA regulators that blocks the maturation of oncomiRs. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate diverse biological processes. Dysregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) has become one of the emerging mechanisms contributes to cancer formation and progression. Increasing evidences suggest that certain miRNAs affect cellular transformation, carcinogenesis and metastasis, and act as oncogenes (oncogenic miRNAs or oncomiRs). Understanding the roles of oncomiRs in cancer will lead to the development of new cancer therapies. Besides, direct therapeutic intervention of oncomiRs has become a promising new direction for treating cancer. For both research and therapeutic purposes, methods allowing the control of oncomiR levels are highly desirable. Current methods for such purposes generally suffer from the off-target inhibition. To address this critical issue, we propose a novel strategy to regulate miRNA. We will develop a new class of bi-functional miRNA regulators consisting of independent and specialized ""pre-miRNA recognition unit"" and ""Dicer inhibition unit"" to target unique pre- miRNAs and block their processing to generate mature miRNAs by inhibiting Dicer enzymatic activity. The following Aims will accomplish our goal of establishing this new strategy: Aim 1. Synthesize and test bi- functional miRNA regulators. We will synthesize bi-functional regulators for miRNA-21 (miR-21) and other oncomiRs and test their inhibitory activity. Aim 2: Test the activity and specificity of the bi-functional miRNA regulator in cells. We will optimize cellular uptake of the regulator in mammalian cells. The cellular activity and off-target effects of the regulator will be evaluated in cells. This work will establish the technical foundation of a novel oncomiR regulation strategy. This unique technology will address the major obstacle encountered in current miRNA regulating methods and enhance the capability to dissect the roles of oncomiRs in cancer biology. It will significantly contribute to the advancement in our knowledge of the role played by oncomiRs in cancer and will result in the development of novel cancer therapies either directly based on the bi- modular regulators or evolved from the understanding of oncomiR functions unveiled by this new technology.",Address;Adverse effects;Affect;Affinity;Antisense Oligonucleotides;Binding;Biogenesis;Biological Assay;Biological Process;Cancer Biology;Cell physiology;Cells;Development;Dicer Enzyme;Foundations;Generations;Goals;In Vitro;Knowledge;Link;Malignant Neoplasms;Mammalian Cell;Messenger RNA;Methods;MicroRNAs;Neoplasm Metastasis;Northern Blotting;Oncogenes;Oncogenic;Pathogenesis;Play;Proteins;Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR;RNA;Regulation;Research;Role;Specificity;Technology;Testing;Therapeutic;Therapeutic Intervention;Untranslated RNA;Western Blotting;Work;base;cancer therapy;cancer type;carcinogenesis;design;improved;inhibitor/antagonist;interest;metaplastic cell transformation;new technology;next generation;novel;novel strategies;novel therapeutics;public health relevance;research and development;ribosome profiling;transcriptome sequencing;uptake,Fu-Sen Liang,Jennifer A.

7R21CA229044-03,R21CA229044,10253467,2020,Novel Platform linking cancer-specific glycosylation with cell signaling outcomes,ABSTRACT Abnormal glycosylation is a hallmark of many cancers that contributes to tumor growth and invasion. There are many protein receptors that are regulated abnormally in cancer due to mutations and/or alterations in glycosylation. Studies to link specific glycosylation changes to signaling outcomes have primarily focused on studies of individual receptors or specific pathways. Methods that can link forms of tumor-specific glycosylation to global effects on signaling pathway activation are needed to better identify potential new targets for therapeutics. To overcome this limitation we are employing the use of heterobifunctional molecule that will link cancer-specific glycosylation on protein receptors with a proximity- induced ubiquitination. To demonstrate the potential and applicability of this method we are using a novel scFv antibody that recognizes tumor-specific glycans present on ovarian cancer and glioblastoma cells that has been demonstrated to have excellent cell permeability. Combining the scFv with proteolysis targeting molecules will enable us to identify receptors and signaling changes using mass spectrometry methods. Successful completion of this project will establish a new platform useful for both basic science research and clinical therapeutic development.,Address;Animal Model;Antibodies;Area;Basic Science;Binding;Cancer Control;Cell Line;Cell Surface Proteins;Cell surface;Cells;Chimera organism;Clinical;Development;Evolution;Feasibility Studies;Future;Glioblastoma;Global Change;Glycoproteins;Goals;Growth;HIF1A gene;Human;In Vitro;Incubated;Individual;Knowledge;Ligands;Link;Longevity;Malignant - descriptor;Malignant Neoplasms;Malignant neoplasm of ovary;Maps;Mass Spectrum Analysis;Mediating;Membrane Proteins;Methods;Mutation;Outcome;Output;Pathway interactions;Peptide Hydrolases;Permeability;Polysaccharides;Post-Translational Protein Processing;Protein Glycosylation;Proteins;Proteolysis;Receptor Signaling;Research;Research Personnel;Research Proposals;Scientist;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;Specificity;Stains;Structure;Testing;Therapeutic;Tumor Cell Invasion;Tumor Tissue;Ubiquitin;Ubiquitination;Xenograft Model;cancer cell;cancer therapy;chimeric antibody;clinical application;clinical implementation;glycosylation;improved;in vivo;innovation;intraperitoneal;method development;migration;mutant;new therapeutic target;novel;receptor;small hairpin RNA;subcutaneous;sugar;therapeutic development;tool;tumor;tumor growth;tumor xenograft;tumorigenesis,Karen L.

7R33CA083232-04,R33CA083232,6745552,2003,APTAMER BASED DETECTOR TO QUANTIFY MACROMOLECULES,"DESCRIPTION: (Applicant's Description) We propose to develop a technology to simultaneously detect and quantify large numbers individual proteins and post-translationally modified proteins. This technology will be based on a spatially-arrayed aptamer microchip and sensitive fluorescence-based optical detection techniques. The system will provide a powerful new tool for biomedical research and diagnosis of diseases and cancers. Currently, the levels of cellular proteins are inferred from cellular mRNA levels by using DNA oligonucleotide microchips. These microchips allow the detection of mRNA levels by base-pairing interactions to homologous DNA oligomers located at different sites in the microchip array. However, this indirect assay of protein levels suffers from two problems: First, mRNA levels may not accurately reflect the level of encoded protein because translation and degradation rates vary from protein to protein and are regulated in response to cell physiology. Second, post-translational modifications proteins often alter critical protein activities. This technology we propose to develop is comprised of three parts: 1) Aptamers with high-affinity and high-specifity for individual proteins. These aptamers will be designed to have ligand-dependent changes in fluorescence properties. 2) A microchip array with each array site occupied by aptamers against a different target molecule. 3) An evanescent field fluorescence detector which detects target molecules binding to aptamers at the array sites. Our proposal includes plans for: 1) selection of aptamers that can discriminate between different post-translational modifications of the same protein; 2) development of fluorescence-based techniques for detecting oligonucleotide:protein interactions; 3) design and construction of an optimized fluorescence detector; 4) scaling up methods to allow large numbers of independent aptamer selections against different proteins; 5) construction of a prototype protein chip.",macromolecule; messenger RNA; microprocessor /microchip; oligonucleotides; posttranslational modifications; proteins; technology /technique development,Andrew D Ellington,John R Knowlton,678625,678625,2004-06-25T12:06:00Z,2003-06-01T12:06:00Z,2007-05-31T12:05:00Z,PAR-99-100,nofo_PAR-99-100,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN,austin,TX,UNITED STATES,imat,org_city,False
7R33CA088343-05,R33CA088343,6800243,2003,FLUORESCENT TAGS TARGETED ON CELL SURFACE CARBOHYDRATES,"Malignant transformation is often associated with alteration of cell surface carbohydrates. The expression or over-expression of certain carbohydrates, such as sialyl Lewis X (sLex), sialyl Lewis a (sLea), Lewis X (Lex) and Lewis Y (Ley), has been correlated with the development of certain cancers. These cell surface carbohydrates can be used for cell-specific identification and targeting of carcinoma cells. The long-term goal of this project is the development of small molecule artificial receptors which can recognize target carbohydrate structures with high selectivity and affinity. Such receptors could be used for the development of fluorescent tags for cell- specific identification, tissue-specific imaging (such as MRI), and targeted delivery of therapeutic agents. In this study, we will use sLex as the model carbohydrate and use colon cancer as the model biological system because the expression of sLex is often associated with progression and metastasis of colon cancer. The short-term objective of this application is to develop tissue-specific fluorescent tags (sensors) which can recognize sLex with high affinity and selectivity. For the construction of such fluorescent sensors, we plan to use an integrated approach combining template-directed synthesis, combinatorial chemistry, and computer molecular modeling aided design. The sLex-specific artificial receptors have the potential to be used for cell identification, detection and tagging for the purpose of localization, staging, tissue biopsy, and fluorescence-directed surgical removal of colon cancer cells. Such tissue-specific compounds could also serve as vehicles for targeted delivery of cancer chemotherapeutic agents. These small molecule sensors may also have the following advantages over antibody-based detection/delivery systems: (1) greater stability during storage and in vivo; (2) increased permeability through biological membranes and, therefore, enhanced target accessibility; (3) intrinsic sensitivity to binding with significant fluorescence intensity increases, making detection and visualization easier and more suitable for high throughout screening, and (4) lower propensity to elicit undesirable immune responses. Similar methods, once developed, could also be used for the construction of fluorescent tags for other cell surface carbohydrates implicated in human malignancies.",carbohydrates; chemical models; colon neoplasms; combinatorial chemistry; computer simulation; drug design /synthesis /production; fluorescent dye /probe; surface antigens; tissue /cell culture,Binghe Wang,John R Knowlton,288000,288000,2003-09-15T12:09:00Z,2000-07-01T12:07:00Z,2005-06-30T12:06:00Z,PAR-99-100,nofo_PAR-99-100,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,atlanta,GA,UNITED STATES,imat,org_city,False
7R33CA092752-04,R33CA092752,7485498,2007,Fast Mutation Detection by Tandem SSCP/HA on Microchips,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is proposed to optimize, evaluate, and pilot rapid, scalable, and low-cost microchip electrophoresis technologies for sensitive and specific molecular detection of cancer by tandem single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP)/heteroduplex analysis (HA), using the p53 gene as a model system. We request a 1-year R21 phase and a 3-year R33 phase. The proposed project involves collaboration between members of Northwestern's Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center, including researchers in Chemical Engineering, the Medical School, and Evanston Hospital. Microchannel ""tandem"" SSCP/HA is a novel mutation detection method recently developed in our laboratory, which involves the simultaneous generation and analysis of homo/heteroduplex DNA and SSCP conformers. Studies of a significant number of samples (32) indicate that tandem SSCP/HA allows for much higher-sensitivity mutation detection (100%) than SSCP alone (93%) or HA alone (75%), for p53 samples. We have developed and published optimized sample preparation protocols, gel formulations, and analysis conditions for capillary array electrophoresis (CAE). During the R21 phase, we will translate these methods to microfluidic electrophoresis chips, which offer a large increase in throughput and drop in cost of DNA analysis compared to CAE. The p53 gene, known to be mutated in >50% of human cancers, and whose mutation status can be predictive of patient response to chemotherapy, is the important model system chosen. However, microchip-based genetic analysis technologies to be developed should be easily applied to ANY cancer-related gene. In the R21 phase, we will analyze approximately 60 different DNA samples derived from tumor cell lines, representing a range of mutations in different p53 exons, to determine the impact of DNA sample characteristics and electrophoresis protocols on the sensitivity and specificity of the method, in a blinded study designed by collaborating biostatisticians. When optimized tandem SSCP/HA protocols have been developed for microchips, they will be piloted by the analysis of >200 selected samples amplified from frozen, solid tumors banked at Evanston Hospital. Via this blinded study, sensitivity and specificity (both expected to be at or near 100%) will be determined and reported for the first time using banked tumor tissue, providing necessary validation for clinical application of this technique, and making rapid, low-cost cancer genotyping technology widely available to physicians.",Address;Admixture;Affect;Age;Biological;Biological Assay;Biological Models;Blinded;Blood capillaries;Cancer Detection;Cancer Patient;Cancer cell line;Capillary Electrophoresis;Characteristics;Chemical Engineering;Clinical;Collaborations;Comprehensive Cancer Center;Condition;Cost Analysis;DNA;DNA Fingerprinting;DNA Sequence;DNA Sequence Alteration;DNA analysis;Data;Detection;Devices;Disease-Free Survival;Drops;Drug Formulations;Economics;Effectiveness;Electrophoresis;Elements;Ensure;Evaluation;Exons;Fluorescence;Freezing;Funding;Gel;Generations;Genes;Genomics;Glass;Heteroduplex Analysis;Homo;Hospitals;Human;Hybridization Array;Immunohistochemistry;Individual;Laboratories;Lasers;Length;Link;Malignant Neoplasms;Mammary Neoplasms;Medical;Methodology;Methods;Microchip Electrophoresis;Microfluidic Microchips;Microfluidics;Migration Assay;Molecular;Mutate;Mutation;Mutation Detection;Negative Axillary Lymph Node;Neoplasm Metastasis;Normal Cell;Numbers;Outcome;Patients;Pattern;Phase;Physicians;Plastics;Polymers;Positive Lymph Node;Preparation;Primary Neoplasm;Probability;Process;Protein p53;Protocols documentation;Publishing;Range;Rate;Recurrence;Reporting;Research Design;Research Personnel;Running;Sampling;Screening procedure;Sensitivity and Specificity;Series;Single-Stranded Conformational Polymorphism;Single-Stranded DNA;Solid Neoplasm;Specimen;Staining method;Stains;Standards of Weights and Measures;Statistically Significant;TP53 gene;Techniques;Technology;Temperature;Tissue Sample;Translating;Tube;Tumor Bank;Tumor Cell Line;Tumor Suppressor Genes;Tumor Tissue;Tumor-Derived;Validation;Work;anticancer research;base;blind;cancer therapy;capillary;chemotherapy;clinical application;clinically relevant;conformer;cost;design;ds-DNA;electric field;genetic analysis;genotyping technology;innovative technologies;interest;malignant breast neoplasm;medical schools;member;micro-total analysis system;microchip;migration;mutant;novel;outcome forecast;response;success;time use;tumor,Annelise Emily Barron,Avraham Rasooly,173000,173000,2007-12-14T12:12:00Z,2007-12-14T12:12:00Z,2009-05-31T12:05:00Z,PAR-01-106,nofo_PAR-01-106,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,stanford,CA,UNITED STATES,imat,org_city,False
7R33CA105295-03,R33CA105295,7141498,2005,Ovarian Cancer Screening Using Comprehensive Proteomics,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The development of biomarkers for earlier detection of ovarian cancer will greatly improve survival. Most women present with advanced stage disease with survival rates of roughly 20%. Advances in the field of proteomics now provide the tools necessary to effectively analyze the serum proteome, and the application of such technologies holds great promise for determining novel biomarkers. This proposal outlines methods to comprehensively discover, identify, quantify, and validate a panel of specific and sensitive ovarian cancer biomarkers for early detection. We propose the following Specific Aims: 1. Determine candidate ovarian cancer biomarkers defined by comprehensive biomarker analysis of serum. Emphasis will be placed on refining the most effective overall analytical strategy for comprehensive and reproducible measurements. Spectral peaks that most accurately distinguish cancer vs. control will be identified using high-resolving power technology. Biostatistics and bioinformatics will be used to prioritize candidate markers (according to specificity, sensitivity and predictive value) for further characterization. 2. Identification and absolute quantification of the candidate biomarkers. This will improve reliability and high-throughput capabilities in subsequent validation testing, and the identification of these proteins will contribute further to research into the biologic basis of the disease. We will use accurate mass measurements, tandem mass spectrometry, and non-redundant protein and genome databases applied to distinct selected controls. Furthermore, we will determine the range of values for both normal and cancer serum samples using stable isotope labeled internal standards. 3. Clinical validation of a panel of biomarkers in specific groups of women. Sera from defined cohorts of women will be used to accurately determine the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of individual and combinations of candidate markers in all aspects of disease (early/late stage, familial, remission and recurrence) and in large numbers of non-cancer controls.",biomarker;clinical research;early diagnosis;female;high throughput technology;human middle age (35-64);human old age (65+);human subject;interview;mass spectrometry;menopause;neoplasm /cancer classification /staging;neoplasm /cancer diagnosis;neoplasm /cancer epidemiology;neoplasm /cancer relapse /recurrence;ovary neoplasms;protein quantitation /detection;proteomics;serum;stable isotope;women&apos;s health,David C.

7R33CA105514-04,R33CA105514,7271419,2007,Assaying Tyrosine Kinase Activity: A New Paradigm,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): New approaches are needed in the molecular analyses of the growth-promoting signal transduction pathways involved in the development and maintenance of cancer. The Laser Micropipet System (LMS), a new technology for the biochemical assay of kinases, holds the promise of directly assaying the activities of protein tyrosine kinases in primary patient cells. The LMS was developed for the assay of serine/threonine kinases in individual cells grown in tissue culture. This R21/R33 application proposes to expand the applications of this instrumentation to directly determine the activity of oncogenic tyrosine kinases in primary cells from patients. Assay of Bcr-Abl in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) will demonstrate the power of this tool for research, clinical, and pharmacologic applications. While this assay will be of value in the study of the biology and resistance mechanisms in CML, the studies will lay the groundwork for a new paradigm in the study of molecular mechanisms in cancer signal transduction and will have general applicability. The R21 phase of this proposal is designed to establish the feasibility of assaying Bcr-Abl activity and to demonstrate the necessary assay conditions for measurements in cells derived from a patient with CML. The specific aims are to: 1) identify and characterize a reporter of intracellular Bcr-Ab1 kinase activity, 2) define and optimize conditions for measuring Bcr-Ab1 activity in human cells, 3) compare reporter phosphorylation in cells expressing Bcr-Ab1 vs. cells lacking this kinase, and 4) demonstrate the feasibility of using primary patient cells in kinase assays. The goal of the R33 phase is to demonstrate the potential for the LMS-based kinase assay in applications for the study of the biology of pharmacologic resistance in CML, including from primary patient cells. The R33 specific aims are to: 1) develop a membrane-permeant Bcr-Ab1 kinase reporter, 2) demonstrate the ability to detect imatinib resistance in CML cell lines, 3) determine Bcr-Ab1 activity in primary cells from patients with CML and their response to pharmacologic inhibition, and 4) determine if the assay can detect the emergence of imatinib resistance in CML patients and can differentiate the mechanisms of drug resistance.",Biochemical;Biological Assay;Biology;Cell Line;Cells;Chronic Myeloid Leukemia;Clinical;Condition;Development;Drug resistance;Goals;Growth;Human;Imatinib;Individual;Lasers;Maintenance;Malignant Neoplasms;Measurement;Measures;Membrane;Molecular;Oncogenic;Patients;Phase;Phosphorylation;Phosphotransferases;Protein Tyrosine Kinase;Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases;Reporter;Research;Resistance;Signal Transduction;Signal Transduction Pathway;System;base;design;instrumentation;new technology;novel strategies;resistance mechanism;response;tissue culture;tool,Christopher E Sims,Min-Kyung H Song,310218,310218,2007-07-23T12:07:00Z,2005-08-08T12:08:00Z,2009-07-31T12:07:00Z,PAR-01-106,nofo_PAR-01-106,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,chapel hill,NC,UNITED STATES,imat,org_city,False
7R33CA107943-05,R33CA107943,7755719,2008,A Novel Proteomics Technology for Protein Farnesylation,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The identification and characterization of changes in the level of farnesylated proteins in response to the treatment of farnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTIs), a newly introduced family of antitumor agents currently undergoing clinical evaluation, represents a major scientific challenge. Extant proteomics methods are limited to quantifying a few thousands of the most abundant proteins and, therefore, are unsuitable for the targeted profiling of less abundant farnesylated expression. The major goal of this application is to develop and validate a powerful technology, Tagging via Azido Substrate (TAS), for the efficient isolation of farnesylated proteins. This technology will then be applied to the proteomics analysis of farnesylated proteins in physiologically relevant models. The TAS technology involves the introduction of a synthetic azide-modified farnesyl substrate, either farnesyl azide diphosphate (FPP-azide) or farnesyl azide alcohol (F-azide-OH), which replaces the natural substrate during cellular protein farnesylation. The resulting farnesyl-azide (F-azide)-modified proteins will be affinity-purified through an azide-specific conjugation reaction (Staudinger reaction) using a phosphine capture reagent linked to photo-cleavable beads, which can then be released by UV light-induced photo-cleavage. Since affinity purification relies on covalent bonding resulting from a specific conjugation reaction between an azide and phosphine capture reagent, other proteins without the F-azide modification can be effectively removed by thorough washing. Thus, the TAS technology will allow farnesylated proteins to be isolated with high yield, high specificity, and low contamination. The initial focus of the R21 portion of this proposal is on the development of TAS technology and its application to the isolation of farnesylated proteins. These studies will be extended subsequently to geranylgeranylated proteins. The R33 proposal will aim at applications of the TAS technology to the identification of novel FTI targets. These studies will provide fundamental information for the understanding of molecular mechanisms of FTI functions and are likely to identify novel targets for antitumor drug design.",Affinity;Affinity Chromatography;Alcohols;Azides;Development;Diphosphates;Drug Design;Family;Farnesyl Transferase Inhibitor;Goals;Link;Methods;Modeling;Modification;Molecular;Phosphines;Protein Farnesylation;Proteins;Proteomics;Reaction;Reagent;Specificity;Technology;antitumor agent;antitumor drug;covalent bond;novel;phosphine;research clinical testing;response,Yingming Zhao,John R Knowlton,461899,461899,2009-01-16T12:01:00Z,2004-06-07T12:06:00Z,2010-03-31T12:03:00Z,PAR-01-104,nofo_PAR-01-104,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,chicago,IL,UNITED STATES,imat,org_city,False
7R33CA114149-04,R33CA114149,7455761,2008,Imaging tumor associated fibroblast activation protein,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this research is to develop a novel fibroblast activation protein (FAP) sensing near infrared fluorescence reporter for early tumor detection and tumor classification. FAP is a cell surface antigen of reactive tumor stromal fibroblasts founded in more than 90% of epithelial carcinomas, but it is absent from epithelial carcinoma cells, normal fibroblasts, and other normal human tissue. Supporting tumor stromal fibroblasts are generally localized close to tumor vasculature, which is essential for early tumor development and growth. Thus it has been chosen as a target for monoclonal antibody based tumor therapy. FAP is not only a membrane protein but also a dipeptidyl peptidase. An imaging probe to report enzymatic activity and location of FAP could be extremely useful for early tumor detection. In this application we will develop a small molecular probe with ultra-sensitivity based on a unique class of fluorogenic chromophore that has significant changes in emission at different chemical states. Specifically, the probes emit no fluorescence in their initial intact state but become brightly fluorescent after specific proteolytic reaction. The newly developed low molecular weight, well defined fluorogenic probes are expected to have several advantages for imaging: a) fast tissue distribution allowing earlier imaging after injection, b) fast clearance allowing repeated imaging, and c) high likelihood of developing key candidates into clinically useful agents. The choice of FAP is based on its importance in tumor growth, invasion, and other processes in oncogenesis. Together with recent developments in fluorescence imaging technologies, this research is expected to ultimately result in clinical imaging agents with specificity for targeted enzymes. We believe that the developed approach can be used as a platform to design a broad spectrum of activatable molecular probes to image other amino peptidases in vivo.",Carcinoma;Chemicals;Class;Classification;Clinical;Detection;Development;Dipeptidyl Peptidases;Drug or chemical Tissue Distribution;Enzymes;Fibroblasts;Fluorescence;Goals;Growth and Development function;Image;Imaging technology;Injection of therapeutic agent;Localized;Location;Malignant Epithelial Cell;Membrane Proteins;Molecular Probes;Molecular Weight;Monoclonal Antibodies;Peptide Hydrolases;Process;Reaction;Reporter;Reporting;Research;Specificity;Stromal Neoplasm;Surface Antigens;base;chromophore;design;fibroblast-activating factor;fluorescence imaging;human tissue;imaging probe;in vivo;novel;tumor;tumor growth;tumorigenesis,Ching-Hsuan Tung,James W.

7R33CA173373-03,R33CA173373,9057813,2015,Clinical validation of the HD-CTC fluid biopsy in early detection of lung cancer.,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Currently, the clinical diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) relies on a number of imaging modalities followed by a tissue confirmation with an invasive procedure. This process is somewhat imprecise because a patient's pathologic diagnosis after surgery may be discordant from pre-operative assessment and may contribute to poor patient prognosis since accurately staging early cancers is essential to good outcome. We hypothesize that rigorously validating the recently developed High Definition Circulating Tumor Cell (HD- CTC) Fluid Biopsy in a controlled clinical cohort of patients undergoing evaluation for lung cancer will improve the accuracy of detection and prognosis in early-stage, malignant nodules of the lung with non-small cell lung cancer histology. We will capitalize on NIH-supported proof of concept data, which has demonstrated that the HD-CTC Fluid Biopsy is capable of detecting disease derived cells in the majority of patients at the time of diagnosis. These data now motivate us to investigate the performance of the assay ""the day before diagnosis"" with the expectation of achieving similar results in a more realistic, prospectively designed, clinical study with matched controls consisting of patients who have non-malignant lung nodules. Our aim is to accurately establish the test characteristics of the HD-CTC fluid biopsy in a group of patients undergoing evaluation for lung cancer and to identify those patients with malignant nodules that have detectable HD-CTCs to determine whether the fluid biopsy can augment 1) clinical staging prior to definitive treatment and 2) prognosis after definitive diagnosis and treatment. We will significantly enhance the test by developing single cell molecular analysis to provide definitive characterization. Integrating non-invasive, reliable and accurate circulating biomarkers with the current standard of care will not only allow for the development of more accurate clinical prediction models that are cost-effective, but may also augment our understanding of tumor biology and metastasis using a clinical, in vivo model of early non-small cell lung cancer.",Advanced Development;Biological Assay;Biological Markers;Biology;Biopsy;Blood Tests;Cancer Histology;Caring;Cells;Characteristics;Clinic;Clinical;Clinical Data;Clinical Research;Data;Detection;Development;Diagnosis;Diagnostic;Disease;Emerging Technologies;Enrollment;Epithelial Cells;Evaluation;Fluorescent in Situ Hybridization;Genome;Genomics;Health;Image;Investigation;Liquid substance;Lung nodule;Malignant - descriptor;Malignant Neoplasms;Malignant neoplasm of lung;Malignant neoplasm of pancreas;Malignant neoplasm of prostate;Measures;Medical;Methods;Modeling;Molecular;Molecular Analysis;Morphology;Neoplasm Circulating Cells;Neoplasm Metastasis;Nodule;Non-Malignant;Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma;Operative Surgical Procedures;Outcome;Pathologic;Patients;Performance;Phase;Positron-Emission Tomography;Procedures;Process;Prospective Studies;Proteins;Publishing;Recurrence;Relative (related person);Research Design;Sampling;Specificity;Staging;Staging System;System;Techniques;Technology;Testing;Time;Tissues;Translations;Tumor Biology;United States National Institutes of Health;Validation;Venous blood sampling;anticancer research;case control;clinical Diagnosis;clinically relevant;cohort;cost effective;design;disorder subtype;expectation;imaging modality;immunocytochemistry;improved;in vivo;in vivo Model;insight;lung cancer screening;malignant breast neoplasm;outcome forecast;performance tests;prognostic;prognostic value;response;standard of care;tool;translational study;tumor;tumor metabolism;tumor progression,Peter Kuhn,Matthew R Young,404236,404236,2015-09-01T12:09:00Z,2013-09-20T12:09:00Z,2016-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-13-002,nofo_RFA-CA-13-002,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,los angeles,CA,UNITED STATES,imat,org_city,False

However, their widespread use is limited by a number of difficulties in manufacturing such cells. Current manufacturing processes are complicated, costly, and can only produce cells for small populations. Additionally, they have large production variations. As a result, different patients receive very different products or treatments. The long-term goal is to develop a novel technology to address the CAR T manufacturing challenge. Toward this goal, the team has developed a proof- of-concept technology termed stress-free intra-tubular cell culture technology (SFIT). SFIT provides cells uniform, highly reproducible, controllable, and cell-friendly microenvironments, resulting in extremely high culture efficiency and consistency. SFIT produces cells for each patient with one small conical tube, significantly reducing production cost and increasing production capability. The purpose of this project is to further develop and validate this technology and the associated methods to make it ready for the final translational challenge. Leveraging sound preliminary studies and a diverse team of experts, the specific aims are to (1) validate SFIT for culturing T cells from a wide range of donors and for culturing various T cell subtypes, (2) further develop and validate methods for transducing T cells with lentivirus and γ-retrovirus in SFIT, and (3) further develop and validate the SFIT-based single-conical-tube-device for producing autologous CAR T cells. The project will build on the team’s strong preliminary work and include mathematical modeling, prototype device design, extensive T cell culturing, exome-Seq and RNA-Seq data analyses, in vivo testing, statistical analyses and comparisons, and partnership with ADS BIOTEC, a company that designs, builds, and sells instruments for processing human cells. With the completion of this project, simple, disposable, affordable devices for the scalable, cost-effective and consistent production of autologous CAR T cells are expected. This technology can also be scaled up for producing allogeneic CAR T cells in large scales if needed. This technology will not only make CAR T cells broadly accessible, but also make the product much more consistent and predictable. Based on 2012-2014 data, approximately 38.5% of the human population will be diagnosed with some type of cancer during their lifetime. Currently, only about 67% of cancer patients will survive five years after diagnosis. CAR T cell therapy is expected to significantly increase their chances of survival. The technology developed in this proposal will make CAR T cells available to many patients.",3-Dimensional;Address;Adopted;Alginates;Allogenic;Autologous;B lymphoid malignancy;CAR T cell therapy;Caliber;Cancer Patient;Cell Aggregation;Cell Culture Techniques;Cell Death;Cells;Clinical Research;Cultured Cells;Data;Data Analyses;Development;Device Designs;Devices;Diagnosis;Diffusion;Disease;Dose;Ensure;Environmental Risk Factor;Gammaretrovirus;Genetic;Genetic Engineering;Geometry;Goals;Human;Hydrogels;Lentivirus;Malignant Neoplasms;Methods;Outcome;Patients;Population;Process;Production;Protocols documentation;Quality of life;Radial;Reproducibility;Solid Neoplasm;Statistical Data Interpretation;Stress;Suspension Culture;T-Lymphocyte;Technology;Time;Translations;Treatment Cost;Tube;Tubular formation;Variant;Virus;Work;base;cancer therapy;cancer type;cell growth;chimeric antigen receptor;chimeric antigen receptor T cells;clinically relevant;cost;cost effective;design;exome sequencing;improved;in vivo;in vivo evaluation;instrument;manufacturing process;mathematical model;new technology;novel;operation;preclinical study;prototype;scale up;shear stress;sound;success;therapy development;transcriptome sequencing;transduction efficiency;tumor,Yuguo Lei,Lokesh Agrawal,356057,356057,2021-04-22T12:04:00Z,2019-03-19T12:03:00Z,2023-02-28T12:02:00Z,RFA-CA-18-005,nofo_RFA-CA-18-005,"PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY, THE",university park,PA,UNITED STATES,imat,org_city,False

There is a clear scientific and medical need for approaches to improve CAR T cell production, including methods to reduce cell processing times, reduce manufacturing costs, and reduce CAR cell differentiation. Recently, our labs collaboratively developed a new technology for CAR cell production called MASTER (Multifunctional Alginate Scaffolds for T cell Engineering and Release). MASTER consists of dry, macroporous alginate materials conjugated to αCD3 and αCD28 antibodies and encapsulating interleukin signaling. CAR generation with MASTER technology involves seeding freshly isolated, non-activated patient PBMCs together with CAR-encoding retroviral vectors and implanting scaffolds back into patients. Once implanted, MASTER mediates every step of the CAR production process, thereby eliminating the current standard procedural steps of αCD3/αCD28 pre-activation, viral transduction with spinoculation and interleukin-mediated CAR expansion. In vitro MASTER-generated CAR cells demonstrate reduced cellular differentiation as compared to CAR cells generated with gold-standard, “conventional” clinical protocols. In vivo MASTER-generated CAR cells demonstrate far superior in vivo cell persistence, enhanced anti-tumor efficacy and far superior prevention of tumor growth after rechallenge. The utility of this system is two-fold: 1) as a transformative therapeutic technology creating enhanced and affordable CAR therapy for cancer care and 2) as a research tool enabling rapid development, prototyping and testing of CAR therapeutic candidates. We have assembled a focused, multidisciplinary team comprised of an expert in biomaterials and drug delivery (Brudno), an expert in viral engineering and protein production (Birnbaum), two specialists in clinical CAR cell production (Chen, Roy) and a clinician focused on CAR cell therapies (Grover). In this proposal we seek to further develop and validate MASTER scaffolds and the associated methods to make them ready for widescale utilization by the research and clinical communities, including researchers in related areas eager to work in the CAR field but deterred by the barriers to test CAR construct in vivo. Leveraging transformative preliminary data that show that the shelf-stable MASTER scaffolds outperform conventional CAR cells in preclinical mouse models of lymphoma, orthotopic pancreatic cancer, and metastatic lung and ovarian tumors this proposal will validate MASTER scaffolds with a wide range of donors and at different scales, with multiple viral vectors and CAR constructs and delineate the phenotype and function resulting from MASTER production of CAR cells. The successful completion of these aims will propel our ultimate vision of low-cost and tunable generation of CAR cells for both liquid and solid tumors and potentially beyond the oncology space.",,Yevgeny Brudno,Ping Guan,261931,261931,2024-09-04T12:09:00Z,2023-08-17T12:08:00Z,2027-07-31T12:07:00Z,RFA-CA-22-004,nofo_RFA-CA-22-004,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,chapel hill,NC,UNITED STATES,imat,org_city,False
1U01CA246665-01,U01CA246665,9895223,2019,A Randomized Trial of a Mobile Health and Social Media Physical Activity Intervention Among Adolescent and Young Adult Childhood Cancer Survivors,"PROJECT SUMMARY Interventions to increase physical activity (PA) are vitally needed in adolescent and young adult childhood cancer survivors (AYA survivors) who are largely inactive but are at lifelong elevated risk of cardiomyopathy, insulin resistance, and other cardiometabolic disorders. To reach AYA survivors, their desire for peer connections, almost ubiquitous use of smartphones and social media, and strong preferences to exercise in their homes and communities and as part of social activity must be leveraged. The intervention must also be accessible and affordable for patients without private health insurance as they are less likely to receive survivorship care and more likely to have greater morbidity. The transdisciplinary study team has completed two recent pilot studies among AYA survivors that provide substantial scientific premise for the proposed research by demonstrating that the intervention is feasible, has high rates of uptake and adherence, and appears promising for increasing PA. The proposed multi-site, randomized controlled trial (RCT) will enroll 384 AYA survivors currently ages 15.0- 20.9 years who are 3-36 months off therapy and not meeting PA guidelines. The 12-month trial will test the efficacy of a 6-month intensive multi-level PA intervention combining a wearable Fitbit PA tracker (intrapersonal level) with integration of activity data leading to individualized goal setting by text (intrapersonal level) and a private Instagram account serving as a virtual peer support group of survivors (interpersonal and community level) followed by a 6-month maintenance phase to improve PA in AYA survivors. Given the ubiquity of PA tracking devices and apps, the control group will receive the Fitbit only without integration of Fitbit data in other activities. A nationwide sample of patients drawn from rural, urban, community, and academic centers will be recruited using the Children’s Oncology Group consortium of >200 hospitals. This rigorously designed, multi-site RCT will test the efficacy of the mobile health (mHealth) behavioral intervention, compared to the control group, to achieve the following Specific Aims among AYA survivors over 12 months: Aim 1 - To increase PA; Aim 2 - To improve biomarkers predictive of cardiometabolic health; and Aim 3 - To improve health-related quality of life.

To reach AYA survivors, their desire for peer connections, almost ubiquitous use of smartphones and social media, and strong preferences to exercise in their homes and communities and as part of social activity must be leveraged. The intervention must also be accessible and affordable for patients without private health insurance as they are less likely to receive survivorship care and more likely to have greater morbidity. The transdisciplinary study team has completed two recent pilot studies among AYA survivors that provide substantial scientific premise for the proposed research by demonstrating that the intervention is feasible, has high rates of uptake and adherence, and appears promising for increasing PA. The proposed multi-site, randomized controlled trial (RCT) will enroll 384 AYA survivors currently ages 15.0- 20.9 years who are 3-36 months off therapy and not meeting PA guidelines. The 12-month trial will test the efficacy of a 6-month intensive multi-level PA intervention combining a wearable Fitbit PA tracker (intrapersonal level) with integration of activity data leading to individualized goal setting by text (intrapersonal level) and a private Instagram account serving as a virtual peer support group of survivors (interpersonal and community level) followed by a 6-month maintenance phase to improve PA in AYA survivors. Given the ubiquity of PA tracking devices and apps, the control group will receive the Fitbit only without integration of Fitbit data in other activities. A nationwide sample of patients drawn from rural, urban, community, and academic centers will be recruited using the Children’s Oncology Group consortium of >200 hospitals. This rigorously designed, multi-site RCT will test the efficacy of the mobile health (mHealth) behavioral intervention, compared to the control group, to achieve the following Specific Aims among AYA survivors over 12 months: Aim 1 - To increase PA; Aim 2 - To improve biomarkers predictive of cardiometabolic health; and Aim 3 - To improve health-related quality of life.

1R21CA231904-01,R21CA231904,9604117,2018,An Ontology-driven Faceted Query Engine for the Kentucky Cancer Registry,"ABSTRACT A key barrier in cancer research is the traditional data access workflow that requires a hypothesis prior to accessing patient data, rather than a workflow that begins with data exploration while protecting privacy. Existing query engines allow researchers to explore clinical data, build queries, and execute queries without the need for the user to understand how the data is stored. However, the interfaces of such query engines have not achieved usability approaching the levels of those for consumer websites due in critical part to the lack of faceted capabilities. Faceted systems for querying clinical data is currently unavailable due to the complexity of data and the mismatch between the ontologies used for organizing and annotating clinical data (such as NCI Thesaurus), and the desired facet structures and properties. We propose to overcome these challenges by developing OncoSphere, a query engine using the NCI Thesaurus as a nested facet system (NFS) to provide web-based exploration of the Kentucky Cancer Registry data using 3 Specific Aims. In Aim 1 we will develop an approach to transform and implement NCI Thesaurus into an NFS to enable OncoSphere’s interface features. In Aim 2 we will develop methods to perform quality auditing on the hierarchical structure of the NCI Thesaurus to enhance its quality in supporting faceted query for OncoSphere. In Aim 3 we will perform evaluation on OncoSphere’s query expressiveness, query performance and conduct preliminary usability assessment. OncoSphere will break new ground in web-based tools and capitalize on available data resources to accelerate cancer research. We expect OncoSphere and its future versions to become an invaluable resource for the cancer research community. The long-term goal of this study is to create data exploration systems for NCI’s Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program and other related cancer data resources through data science innovations to transform user experience with a new generation of data interaction modalities.",Address;Adopted;Area;Biomedical Research;Characteristics;Clinical Data;Clinical Research;Clinical Trials;Communities;Computer software;Data;Data Science;Databases;Detection;Development;Ensure;Evaluation;Future;Generations;Goals;Kentucky;Knowledge;Lead;Malignant Neoplasms;Metadata;Methods;Modality;NCI Thesaurus;Online Systems;Ontology;Patients;Performance;Privacy;Property;Research Personnel;Resources;Role;SEER Program;Site;Software Tools;Structure;System;Terminology;Time;Translations;Trees;Work;anticancer research;data access;data integration;data management;data registry;data resource;design;experience;human data;improved;innovation;insight;lexical;neoplasm registry;neoplasm resource;novel;query optimization;sound;success;tool;usability;web app;web site;web-based tool,Licong Cui; Guo-Qiang Zhang,Donna Rivera,187621,187621,2018-06-06T12:06:00Z,2018-06-06T12:06:00Z,2019-02-03T12:02:00Z,PAR-15-334,nofo_PAR-15-334,UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY,lexington,KY,UNITED STATES,itcr,org_city,False

Genomics holds promise for improving classification and prognostication of malignancies, yet oncology practice continues to rely heavily on immunohistochemistry (IHC) as a fundamental tool due to its practicality and ability to provide protein-level and subcellular localization information. The goal of this proposal is to create an open-source software resource for the quantitative analysis of IHC stained tissues and effective integration of IHC, genomic, and clinical features for cancer classification and prognostication. This proposal builds on our collective experience in computer-assisted analysis of microscopic images (including IHC images), development of machine-learning methods to address the challenges of classification and prognostication with heterogeneous and high-dimensional data, and leadership in collection and large-scale analysis of cancer outcomes involving collaboration with multiple medical centers. This effort for the first time will create tools to integrate quantitative IHC imaging, clinical, and genomic information that will in turn enable the research community to explore strategies for the classification of malignancies and prediction of outcomes. The proposed tools will be developed and extensively validated in close collaboration with clinical, genomic, and digital pathology data from the NCI-supported Lymphoma Epidemiology of Outcomes (LEO) cohort study. The software tools produced by this proposal will enable the characterization of subcellular protein expression in cell nuclei, membranes and cytoplasmic compartments. Spatial features of protein expression heterogeneity, along with patient-level summaries of protein expression will be used to develop machine-learning classifiers for cancer subtypes, using diffuse large b-cell lymphomas as a driving application. Technology for automatic tuning of machine learning algorithms will enable a broad class of clinically and biologically motivated users to utilize these tools in their investigations. We will also provide an interactive dashboard that enables users to integrate genomic and IHC-based features to explore prognostic models of patient survival.

We will leverage and extend an existing training platform and content we have developed. We will improve cancer informatics literacy and the usability of existing ITCR tools, support future ITCR tool developers, and teach informatics to a broad cross-section of interested parties. Our success will both deepen expertise within the field and broaden the exposure of ITCR tools within currently-unengaged research communities. Specifically, we will: (1) develop and release a software platform for rapidly prototyping, validating, and sharing modular training materials that can be delivered in a range of formats from massive online open courses, to in-person short courses, to in depth semester long courses, (2) develop informatics courses teaching not only specific use of ITCR tools to solve concrete scientific challenges but also broadly the concepts of informatics to a broad community ranging from citizen scientists to NCI funded PIs, (3) develop courses for ITCR tool developers around usability, documentation, support and marketing to improve the impact of these tools in the field, and (4) deliver in person and ""train the trainer"" courses that will scale the impact of our educational program both within NIH funded cancer centers and into currently underserved researchers at community colleges, minority serving institutions, historically black colleges and universities, and engaged citizens outside of academia. All software, content, and data developed by our program will be open source and made accessible to the broadest possible audience by leveraging our existing expertise in online and scalable in-person education, along with our relationships to MOOC providers, informatics platforms, and developers. We will thus will dramatically increase cancer informatics knowledge and skill, and speed the adoption and use of data to tackle important problems in cancer throughout the research enterprise.",Academia;Address;Adoption;Cancer Center;Communities;Computer software;Data;Data Analyses;Data Analytics;Data Collection;Data Science;Data Storage and Retrieval;Documentation;Education;Educational process of instructing;Event;Exercise;Explosion;Funding;Future;Galaxy;Geography;Goals;Heart;Historically Black Colleges and Universities;Home environment;Informatics;Institution;Knowledge;Licensing;Location;Malignant Neoplasms;Marketing;Measurement;Medical;Minority-Serving Institution;Persons;Phase Transition;Principal Investigator;Provider;Reproducibility;Research;Research Personnel;Resources;Scientist;Site;Software Tools;Speed;Technology;Time;Trainers Training;Training;United States National Institutes of Health;anticancer research;citizen science;community college;cost;data tools;education resources;experience;improved;informatics tool;informatics training;instructor;interest;learning materials;lectures;literacy;massive open online courses;meetings;member;multimodality;online course;open source;outreach;programs;prototype;skills;software development;success;tool;training opportunity;usability,Jeremy Goecks; Jeffrey T.

2U24CA180996-07,U24CA180996,9722332,2019,Cancer Genomics: Integrative and Salable Solutions in R/Bioconductor,"Abstract Bioconductor is an ecosystem of more than 1,500 open-source software and data packages for the statistical analysis and comprehension of high-throughput genomic data. It is widely used by the cancer genomics research community for statistical analysis and visualization. This software ecosystem is supported by core data classes and methods, reused by both users and developers, that provide convenient representations and efficient operations for many kinds of high-throughput molecular data. Falling sequencing costs and single-cell assays enable increasingly resolved study of the molecular biology of cancer, through combined assaying of DNA sequence, epigenetics, gene expression, protein, and other aspects, even at the single-cell level, for a single specimen. These developments present new challenges in complexity, size, and interpretability of the data. The overarching goal of this project is to create and adapt core Bioconductor software infrastructure to meet these challenges, through the following aims. First, we develop infrastructure for the analysis of single-cell multi-omic experiments. Second, we implement FAIR principles for improved somatic variant prioritization, by defining performant data architecture that harmonizes and integrates the large amount of experimental and annotation data available through Bioconductor. Users of our system will be able to create provenance-rich interoperable reports on structural and functional contexts of somatic variants for use in prioritization. Third, we develop scalable infrastructure for the curation, distribution, maintenance, discoverability, and usability of cancer data resources within and externally to Bioconductor. Finally, we develop a program of user training and new outreach approaches to support adoption of advanced Bioconductor infrastructure by developers of new cancer-related packages and existing packages critical to the cancer research community.",Address;Adoption;Architecture;Archives;Area;Bioconductor;Biological;Biological Assay;Cancer Biology;Cells;Cellular Assay;Communities;Community Participation;Complex;Comprehension;Computer software;DNA Methylation;DNA Sequence;Data;Data Set;Development;Documentation;Ecosystem;Environment;Epigenetic Process;Event;Exposure to;FAIR principles;Funding;Gene Expression;Genes;Genome;Genomic DNA;Genomics;Goals;Growth;Imagery;Immune;Individual;Infrastructure;Institution;Link;Maintenance;Malignant Neoplasms;Memory;Messenger RNA;Methods;Molecular;Molecular Biology;Point Mutation;Precision therapeutics;Programming Languages;Proteins;Protocols documentation;Recurrence;Regulatory Element;Reporting;Reproducibility;Research;Research Personnel;Resources;Role;Sales;Specimen;Standardization;Statistical Data Interpretation;Structure;System;Technology;The Cancer Genome Atlas;Training;Training Support;Untranslated RNA;Variant;anticancer research;base;cancer cell;cancer genomics;clinically relevant;cloud based;computer infrastructure;cost;data resource;differential expression;experimental study;falls;genetic information;genomic data;improved;interoperability;learning materials;multiple omics;navigation aid;neoplastic cell;novel;novel strategies;open source;operation;outreach;programs;residence;response;single cell analysis;software development;training opportunity;tumor;tumor heterogeneity;tumor microenvironment;usability,Martin T Morgan; Levi David Waldron,Huann-Sheng Chen,693486,693486,2019-09-13T12:09:00Z,2014-09-01T12:09:00Z,2024-08-31T12:08:00Z,PAR-15-331,nofo_PAR15-331,ROSWELL PARK CANCER INSTITUTE CORP,buffalo,NY,UNITED STATES,itcr,org_city,False

7R21CA231904-02,R21CA231904,9949194,2019,An Ontology-driven Faceted Query Engine for the Kentucky Cancer Registry,"ABSTRACT A key barrier in cancer research is the traditional data access workflow that requires a hypothesis prior to accessing patient data, rather than a workflow that begins with data exploration while protecting privacy. Existing query engines allow researchers to explore clinical data, build queries, and execute queries without the need for the user to understand how the data is stored. However, the interfaces of such query engines have not achieved usability approaching the levels of those for consumer websites due in critical part to the lack of faceted capabilities. Faceted systems for querying clinical data is currently unavailable due to the complexity of data and the mismatch between the ontologies used for organizing and annotating clinical data (such as NCI Thesaurus), and the desired facet structures and properties. We propose to overcome these challenges by developing OncoSphere, a query engine using the NCI Thesaurus as a nested facet system (NFS) to provide web-based exploration of the Kentucky Cancer Registry data using 3 Specific Aims. In Aim 1 we will develop an approach to transform and implement NCI Thesaurus into an NFS to enable OncoSphere’s interface features. In Aim 2 we will develop methods to perform quality auditing on the hierarchical structure of the NCI Thesaurus to enhance its quality in supporting faceted query for OncoSphere. In Aim 3 we will perform evaluation on OncoSphere’s query expressiveness, query performance and conduct preliminary usability assessment. OncoSphere will break new ground in web-based tools and capitalize on available data resources to accelerate cancer research. We expect OncoSphere and its future versions to become an invaluable resource for the cancer research community.

Genomics holds promise for improving classification and prognostication of malignancies, yet oncology practice continues to rely heavily on immunohistochemistry (IHC) as a fundamental tool due to its practicality and ability to provide protein-level and subcellular localization information. The goal of this proposal is to create an open-source software resource for the quantitative analysis of IHC stained tissues and effective integration of IHC, genomic, and clinical features for cancer classification and prognostication. This proposal builds on our collective experience in computer-assisted analysis of microscopic images (including IHC images), development of machine-learning methods to address the challenges of classification and prognostication with heterogeneous and high-dimensional data, and leadership in collection and large-scale analysis of cancer outcomes involving collaboration with multiple medical centers. This effort for the first time will create tools to integrate quantitative IHC imaging, clinical, and genomic information that will in turn enable the research community to explore strategies for the classification of malignancies and prediction of outcomes. The proposed tools will be developed and extensively validated in close collaboration with clinical, genomic, and digital pathology data from the NCI-supported Lymphoma Epidemiology of Outcomes (LEO) cohort study. The software tools produced by this proposal will enable the characterization of subcellular protein expression in cell nuclei, membranes and cytoplasmic compartments. Spatial features of protein expression heterogeneity, along with patient-level summaries of protein expression will be used to develop machine-learning classifiers for cancer subtypes, using diffuse large b-cell lymphomas as a driving application. Technology for automatic tuning of machine learning algorithms will enable a broad class of clinically and biologically motivated users to utilize these tools in their investigations. We will also provide an interactive dashboard that enables users to integrate genomic and IHC-based features to explore prognostic models of patient survival. These tools will be released and documented under an open-source model, integrated with HistomicsTK (https://histomicstk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), and available to the broader cancer research community.",,Lee Cooper; Christopher R Flowers; Metin Nafi Gurcan,Rao L Divi,425457,425457,2020-05-28T12:05:00Z,2018-06-12T12:06:00Z,2022-05-31T12:05:00Z,PAR-15-332,nofo_PAR-15-332,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,chicago,IL,UNITED STATES,itcr,org_city,False
1R01CA204136-01A1,R01CA204136,9239352,2017,Credentialing murine models for glioblastoma preclinical drug development,"ABSTRACT Precision medicine promises to revolutionize oncology by targeting drugs to specific mutations. However, targeted drugs have failed to produce durable clinical responses when used as single agents in glioblastoma (GBM), the most common and deadly primary brain tumor. Genetically engineered mouse (GEM) models are essential for functional validation of such mutations, but technical limitations have prevented their widespread use in preclinical cancer drug development. The Miller Lab has developed non- germline GEM (nGEM) models. The Berens Lab has performed comprehensive genomic and chemovulnerability profiling in a genetically diverse and faithful panel of patient-derived human xenograft (PDX) models. The Johnson Lab has developed a novel chemical proteomics method, multiplex inhibitor beads coupled with mass spectrometry (MIB-MS), to assess the activation state of the cellular kinome en masse and has shown that dynamic kinome reprogramming contributes to targeted drug resistance. In this Multi-PI project, we will combine our expertise to address the following Aims: (1) To credential PDX models against human GBM by kinome proteomics; (2) To develop genetically-matched nGEM models from distinct cells of origin; and (3) To credential PDX and nGEM models by dynamic kinome profiling. We will develop a genetically diverse panel of nGEM models with defined driver mutations and cellular origins that will be useful adjunct to PDX for preclinical drug development. We will then credential both PDX and nGEM models against resected GBM specimens using cross-species genome, transcriptome, and kinome, and drug response profiling. Models will be genomically matched to their human counterparts and used to develop rational combination therapies that combat single agent resistance mechanisms in genomically- defined tumor subtypes. This work will therefore help realize the promise of precision medicine in neuro- oncology.",ATRX gene;Address;Allografting;Antibodies;Antineoplastic Agents;Astrocytes;BRAF gene;Behavior;Biological;CDKN2A gene;Cancer Biology;Cell Culture Techniques;Cell physiology;Cells;Chemicals;Clinical;Clinical Trials;Combined Modality Therapy;Coupled;Credentialing;Cultured Cells;Disease;Drug Combinations;Drug Modulation;Drug Targeting;Drug resistance;ERBB2 gene;Environment;Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor;Fatal Outcome;Gene Targeting;Genes;Genetic;Genetically Engineered Mouse;Genome;Genomics;Glioblastoma;Goals;Growth;Heterogeneity;Human;Immunoassay;MAP Kinase Gene;Malignant Neoplasms;Malignant neoplasm of brain;Mass Spectrum Analysis;Mediating;Methods;Modeling;Molecular;Monitor;Mus;Mutate;Mutation;NF1 gene;Normal Cell;Operative Surgical Procedures;PIK3CG gene;PTEN gene;Pathogenesis;Pathologic;Pathway interactions;Patients;Penetrance;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacodynamics;Phosphotransferases;Preclinical Drug Development;Preclinical Drug Evaluation;Primary Brain Neoplasms;Proteomics;Reagent;Recurrence;Research Personnel;Resected;Resistance;Signal Transduction;Specimen;TP53 gene;Techniques;Testing;Transplantation;Tumor Subtype;Validation;Work;Xenograft Model;Xenograft procedure;actionable mutation;astrocyte progenitor;base;bcr-abl Fusion Proteins;brain cell;cell type;clinically relevant;combat;dark matter;disorder subtype;drug development;drug discovery;effective therapy;exome;human disease;in vitro Model;in vivo;individualized medicine;inhibitor/antagonist;kinase inhibitor;leukemia;malignant breast neoplasm;melanoma;mouse model;nerve stem cell;neuro-oncology;novel;oligodendrocyte progenitor;oncology;pre-clinical;precision medicine;prevent;prospective;public health relevance;resistance mechanism;response;targeted treatment;three dimensional cell culture;transcriptome;transcriptome sequencing;tumor,Michael E.

1R01CA222148-01A1,R01CA222148,9740709,2019,Conditionally Reprogrammed Cell Model for Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC),"Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most frequently diagnosed cancer (180,890 new cases in 2016) in men in the USA. Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is an effective first line therapy for locally advanced or metastatic disease. Unfortunately, once PCa recurs, the eventual development of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) remains an incurable disease and more effective therapies are needed. Currently, a limited number of cancer cell lines (LnCAP, PC3, DU-145, etc.) are available for research and many genetic mutations present in prostate cancer (e.g., SPOP mutation, FOXA1 mutation, TMPRSS2-ERG fusion, CHD1 loss) are not represented in such cells. New patient-derived cancer models are needed. However, patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models are successful at less than 2-5% efficiency with aggressive, high-grade metastatic tumors and organoid cultures only have an efficiency of 20%. However, our preliminary data demonstrate that conditional reprogramming (CR) has nearly a 100% success rate for establishing long-term cultures from either surgical prostate specimens or CT-guided biopsies. In this application, we propose the following specific aims to validate the potential of CR for translational use in human CRPC. We will first establish CR cultures from biopsies of 30 patients with CRPC and will characterize these culture genetically and phenotypically. Second, we compare the patients' drug response to those of corresponding tumor CR cells and their derivative CR- derived xenografts (CDXs). Lastly, we will use CR cultures in an unbiased high-throughput screen to identify new potential therapies for CRPC in collaboration with Dr. Craig Thomas at National Center for Advanced Translational Sciences (NCATS).

However, targeted drugs have failed to produce durable clinical responses when used as single agents in glioblastoma (GBM), the most common and deadly primary brain tumor. Genetically engineered mouse (GEM) models are essential for functional validation of such mutations, but technical limitations have prevented their widespread use in preclinical cancer drug development. The Miller Lab has developed non- germline GEM (nGEM) models. The Berens Lab has performed comprehensive genomic and chemovulnerability profiling in a genetically diverse and faithful panel of patient-derived human xenograft (PDX) models. The Johnson Lab has developed a novel chemical proteomics method, multiplex inhibitor beads coupled with mass spectrometry (MIB-MS), to assess the activation state of the cellular kinome en masse and has shown that dynamic kinome reprogramming contributes to targeted drug resistance. In this Multi-PI project, we will combine our expertise to address the following Aims: (1) To credential PDX models against human GBM by kinome proteomics; (2) To develop genetically-matched nGEM models from distinct cells of origin; and (3) To credential PDX and nGEM models by dynamic kinome profiling. We will develop a genetically diverse panel of nGEM models with defined driver mutations and cellular origins that will be useful adjunct to PDX for preclinical drug development. We will then credential both PDX and nGEM models against resected GBM specimens using cross-species genome, transcriptome, and kinome, and drug response profiling. Models will be genomically matched to their human counterparts and used to develop rational combination therapies that combat single agent resistance mechanisms in genomically- defined tumor subtypes.

1U01CA199288-01,U01CA199288,8968148,2015,In Vivo Drug Testing of Pediatric CNS Tumors Using Patient Derived Orthotopic Xenograft Models,"﻿ DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is prepared in response to the funding opportunity: Pediatric Preclinical Testing Consortium Research Programs (U01), RFA-CA-14-018. Specifically, we propose for Type B: Research Program for tumors of central nervous system (CNS) in vivo testing. Brain tumors are the leading cause of cancer-related death in children. One of the challenges in clinical drug development is how to effectively prioritize drug candidates to ensure clinical success in cancer patients. As pediatric drug candidates are much more numerous than the small number of patients, it is essential to perform comprehensive pre-clinical testing to identify the investigational agents that are most likely to be effective in the clinic. However, such effort has been blocked for many years due to the lack of clinically relevant and molecularly accurate model systems. Fortunately, we have established a large panel (>70) of patient derived orthotopic xenograft (PDOX) models of pediatric brain tumors through direct injection of patient tumor specimens into the brains of SCID mice. These PDOX models are shown to have replicated the histopathological features, invasive phenotypes and major genetic abnormalities (gene expression, DNA copy number and gene mutations) of the original primary tumors even during serial sub-transplantations in vivo in mouse brains. The xenograft tumor cells can also be cryopreserved for sustained and on-demand supply of tumorigenic PDOX cells. This capacity combined with our optimized surgical procedure, with which we can implant up to 260 mice per day, makes it possible for us to test multiple (e.g., 6-10) drugs per year for every tumor type. Our objective is therefore to make use of this unique panel of PDOX models to examine therapeutic efficacy of new agents and to analyze mechanisms of action and therapy resistance in high grade glioma, medulloblastoma and ependymoma. Our hypothesis is that these patient-specific PDOX tumors will respond to anti-cancer therapies similarly to the corresponding human primary tumors, and the effective agents identified through this system would have better chances of clinical success. To test this hypothesis, we will perform a series of in vitro and in vivo assays to achieve the following aims: 1) to identify genetically accurate candidate PDOX models that bear the therapeutic target(s) of new investigational drugs through data mining of our mouse model molecular characterization databases; 2) to select the most responsive models through functional in vitro screening to determine time- and dose- responses; 3) to demonstrate therapeutic efficacy of new investigational drugs in multiple target-bearing PDOX models; and 4) to perform detailed analysis of cellular and molecular mechanisms of cell killing as well as the causes of therapy resistance both in vitro and in vivo. Our novel panel of PDOX mouse models represents a broad spectrum of genetic abnormalities of pediatric CNS tumors. All the assays are well established and routinely performed in our laboratory; we are uniquely positioned to accomplish the proposed drug studies in vivo.

Our lab’s long- term mission is to identify novel molecular targets in osteosarcoma via comprehensive genomic and proteomic profiling of patient-derived cell lines and xenografts as well as human tumors with the ultimate goal of identifying and/or developing and testing therapeutics against these targets. To achieve this goal, we have a) built a robust profiling platform to identify novel targets; b) expanded our repertoire of osteosarcoma patient derived xenograft (PDX) models to reflect disease heterogeneity; and c) conducted high-throughput in vivo testing of 8-10 new agents each year both as part of Pediatric Preclinical Testing Consortium (PPTC) as well as independent of it. All of these efforts form the basis of our current research proposal and place us strongly poised to successfully achieve our goals. Our overall objective is to efficiently evaluate the efficacy of new agents with high potential to have activity in osteosarcoma based on target data from our genomic and proteomic profiling both as single agents and in rational combinations, with the vision of moving effective agents into clinical trials through the Children’s Oncology Group. We have three specific aims- 1) to select and test agents in vivo against surface targets identified by comprehensive proteomic profiling of osteosarcoma xenografts and patient tumors; 2) to select and test agents in vivo against targets identified by comprehensive genomic profiling of osteosarcoma xenografts and patient tumors; and 3) to perform testing of rationally combined agents based on target, toxicity and efficacy data of single agents. Agents from the PPTC pipeline will be selected based on either the proteomic target or genomic alteration being present in at least a subset of available osteosarcoma PDX models. The agent will be tested in selected cohorts of low/ high expressing protein target or present/ absent genomic alteration. In cases with multiple models with target expression, 3-5 mice per model will be used and in cases with few models available, 8-10 mice per model will be used for control and experiment groups with an overall n per arm per experiment of approximately 30 mice. Standard PPTC procedures will be used for tumor implantation and treatment. Tumor dimensions will be measured twice a week and response quantified as per standard PPTC definitions of complete response, maintained complete response, partial response, stable disease and progressive disease. For combination studies, three potential types of combinations will be considered based on efficacy and toxicity data- a) two surface protein targeted agents such as two antibody-drug conjugates; 2) two molecularly targeted agents and 3) a surface protein targeted agent and a molecularly targeted agent.

They not only represent different clinical stage (i.e., at diagnosis, relapse and terminal/autopsy) but also replicate a broad spectrum of the newly identified molecular subtypes of nearly all types of pediatric brain tumors.

5U01CA199221-06,U01CA199221,9772989,2019,Osteosarcoma: Patient Derived Xenograft Preclinical Testing,"﻿ DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Osteosarcoma is a disease in which the recent lack of progress in improving patient survival strongly suggests the need for novel treatment approaches. A panel of well characterized osteosarcoma patient derived xenografts with genetic changes recapitulating the disease, have been tested by our laboratory as part of the Pediatric Preclinical Testing Program. These efforts thus far have been highly successful in identifying several drugs which are currently being or about to be tested in osteosarcoma clinical trials conducted by the Children's Oncology Group - specifically eribulin and glembatumumab vedotin. Numerous additional osteosarcoma patient derived xenograft models have been developed potentially permitting expansion of the panel of tumors assessed. In this proposal exploration of using a more efficient approach to screen for drug activity in the established models may permit utilization of a broader panel of osteosarcoma patient derived xenografts. In this proposal eltrombopag will be explored for activity in the treatment of osteosarcoma based on promising in vitro data. Building on prior findings, eribulin will be tested for additive activiy with agents routinely used in the treatment of osteosarcoma including cisplatin, cyclophosphamide and etoposide. Finally, a novel ALK inhibitor that also has IGF-1R inhibitory activity, certinib, will be tested as a single agent and in combination with rapamycin for activityin the osteosarcoma patient derived xenografts.

Our lab’s long- term mission is to identify novel molecular targets in osteosarcoma via comprehensive genomic and proteomic profiling of patient-derived cell lines and xenografts as well as human tumors with the ultimate goal of identifying and/or developing and testing therapeutics against these targets. To achieve this goal, we have a) built a robust profiling platform to identify novel targets; b) expanded our repertoire of osteosarcoma patient derived xenograft (PDX) models to reflect disease heterogeneity; and c) conducted high-throughput in vivo testing of 8-10 new agents each year both as part of Pediatric Preclinical Testing Consortium (PPTC) as well as independent of it. All of these efforts form the basis of our current research proposal and place us strongly poised to successfully achieve our goals. Our overall objective is to efficiently evaluate the efficacy of new agents with high potential to have activity in osteosarcoma based on target data from our genomic and proteomic profiling both as single agents and in rational combinations, with the vision of moving effective agents into clinical trials through the Children’s Oncology Group. We have three specific aims- 1) to select and test agents in vivo against surface targets identified by comprehensive proteomic profiling of osteosarcoma xenografts and patient tumors; 2) to select and test agents in vivo against targets identified by comprehensive genomic profiling of osteosarcoma xenografts and patient tumors; and 3) to perform testing of rationally combined agents based on target, toxicity and efficacy data of single agents. Agents from the PPTC pipeline will be selected based on either the proteomic target or genomic alteration being present in at least a subset of available osteosarcoma PDX models. The agent will be tested in selected cohorts of low/ high expressing protein target or present/ absent genomic alteration. In cases with multiple models with target expression, 3-5 mice per model will be used and in cases with few models available, 8-10 mice per model will be used for control and experiment groups with an overall n per arm per experiment of approximately 30 mice. Standard PPTC procedures will be used for tumor implantation and treatment. Tumor dimensions will be measured twice a week and response quantified as per standard PPTC definitions of complete response, maintained complete response, partial response, stable disease and progressive disease. For combination studies, three potential types of combinations will be considered based on efficacy and toxicity data- a) two surface protein targeted agents such as two antibody-drug conjugates; 2) two molecularly targeted agents and 3) a surface protein targeted agent and a molecularly targeted agent.

Specifically, we propose for Type B: Research Program for tumors of central nervous system (CNS) in vivo testing. Brain tumors are the leading cause of cancer-related death in children. One of the challenges in clinical drug development is how to effectively prioritize drug candidates to ensure clinical success in cancer patients. As pediatric drug candidates are much more numerous than the small number of patients, it is essential to perform comprehensive pre-clinical testing to identify the investigational agents that are most likely to be effective in the clinic. However, such effort has been blocked for many years due to the lack of clinically relevant and molecularly accurate model systems. Fortunately, we have established a large panel (>70) of patient derived orthotopic xenograft (PDOX) models of pediatric brain tumors through direct injection of patient tumor specimens into the brains of SCID mice. These PDOX models are shown to have replicated the histopathological features, invasive phenotypes and major genetic abnormalities (gene expression, DNA copy number and gene mutations) of the original primary tumors even during serial sub-transplantations in vivo in mouse brains. The xenograft tumor cells can also be cryopreserved for sustained and on-demand supply of tumorigenic PDOX cells. This capacity combined with our optimized surgical procedure, with which we can implant up to 260 mice per day, makes it possible for us to test multiple (e.g., 6-10) drugs per year for every tumor type. Our objective is therefore to make use of this unique panel of PDOX models to examine therapeutic efficacy of new agents and to analyze mechanisms of action and therapy resistance in high grade glioma, medulloblastoma and ependymoma. Our hypothesis is that these patient-specific PDOX tumors will respond to anti-cancer therapies similarly to the corresponding human primary tumors, and the effective agents identified through this system would have better chances of clinical success. To test this hypothesis, we will perform a series of in vitro and in vivo assays to achieve the following aims: 1) to identify genetically accurate candidate PDOX models that bear the therapeutic target(s) of new investigational drugs through data mining of our mouse model molecular characterization databases; 2) to select the most responsive models through functional in vitro screening to determine time- and dose- responses; 3) to demonstrate therapeutic efficacy of new investigational drugs in multiple target-bearing PDOX models; and 4) to perform detailed analysis of cellular and molecular mechanisms of cell killing as well as the causes of therapy resistance both in vitro and in vivo. Our novel panel of PDOX mouse models represents a broad spectrum of genetic abnormalities of pediatric CNS tumors.

Specifically, we propose to continue the in vivo testing program for central nervous system (CNS) tumors using our panel of patient derived orthotopic xenograft (PDOX) models. Brain tumor is the leading cause of cancer-related death in children. One of the challenges in clinical drug development is how to effectively prioritize drug candidates to ensure clinical success in cancer patients. However, efforts in identifying new anti-cancer agents for that are most likely to be effective in the clinic have been blocked for many years due to the lack of clinically relevant and molecularly accurate model system. Fortunately, we have established a panel of 150 PDOX models of pediatric brain tumors through direct injection of patient tumor specimens into the brains of SCID mice. These PDOX models are shown to have replicated the histopathology and major genetic abnormalities of the original patient tumors even during serial sub-transplantations in vivo in mouse brains. They not only represent different clinical stage (i.e., at diagnosis, relapse and terminal/autopsy) but also replicate a broad spectrum of the newly identified molecular subtypes of nearly all types of pediatric brain tumors. The xenograft tumor cells can also be cryopreserved for sustained and on-demand supply of tumorigenic PDOX cells. This capacity combined with our optimized surgical procedure, with which we can implant up to 260 mice per day, makes it possible for us to test multiple (e.g., 6-10) drugs per year for every tumor type. Our objective is therefore to make use of this unique panel of PDOX models to examine therapeutic efficacy of new agents and to analyze mechanisms of action and therapy resistance in high grade glioma, medulloblastoma, ependymoma, DIPG and ATRT. Our hypothesis is that these patient-specific PDOX tumors will respond to anti-cancer therapies similarly to the corresponding human primary tumors, and the effective agents identified through this system would have better chances of clinical success. To test this hypothesis, we will perform a series of in vitro and in vivo assays to achieve the following aims: 1) to identify genetically accurate candidate PDOX models that bear the therapeutic target(s) of new investigational drugs through data mining of our mouse model molecular characterization databases; 2) to select the most responsive models through functional in vitro screening to determine time- and dose-responses; 3) to demonstrate therapeutic efficacy of new investigational drugs in multiple target-bearing PDOX models; and 4) to perform detailed analysis of cellular and molecular mechanisms of cell killing as well as the causes of therapy resistance both in vitro and in vivo.

A panel of well characterized osteosarcoma patient derived xenografts with genetic changes recapitulating the disease, have been tested by our laboratory as part of the Pediatric Preclinical Testing Program. These efforts thus far have been highly successful in identifying several drugs which are currently being or about to be tested in osteosarcoma clinical trials conducted by the Children's Oncology Group - specifically eribulin and glembatumumab vedotin. Numerous additional osteosarcoma patient derived xenograft models have been developed potentially permitting expansion of the panel of tumors assessed. In this proposal exploration of using a more efficient approach to screen for drug activity in the established models may permit utilization of a broader panel of osteosarcoma patient derived xenografts. In this proposal eltrombopag will be explored for activity in the treatment of osteosarcoma based on promising in vitro data. Building on prior findings, eribulin will be tested for additive activiy with agents routinely used in the treatment of osteosarcoma including cisplatin, cyclophosphamide and etoposide. Finally, a novel ALK inhibitor that also has IGF-1R inhibitory activity, certinib, will be tested as a single agent and in combination with rapamycin for activityin the osteosarcoma patient derived xenografts.

1U01CA274304-01,U01CA274304,10517972,2022,Reprogramming PDAC Stroma by Targeting Coagulation in the Tumor Microenvironment,"PROJECT SUMMARY The overarching goal of this research program is to identify therapeutic strategies to convert the stroma of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) to a chemo- and immune-sensitive tumor microenvironment (TME). PDAC is characterized by a desmoplastic stroma that facilitates tumor growth/invasion, chemoresistance of pancreatic cancer cells (PCC), and immunosuppressive TME. Highly packed cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and dense extracellular matrix (ECM) are hallmarks of the PDAC stroma and constitute physical drug delivery barriers. Several stromal components have been targeted to enhance drug delivery, but recent studies have suggested anti-tumor roles for the stroma as complete ablation of stromal components leads to more aggressive tumors. New strategies are highly desired to reprogram stroma without compromising its anti-tumor roles. The central hypothesis is that the coagulation system in the PDAC TME can be targeted to reprogram PDAC stroma to overcome chemoresistance, drug delivery barriers, and immunosuppressive TME. Cancer- associated coagulation has been reported as a key functional signaling pathway in PDAC. Notably, several coagulation molecular targets, including thrombin, protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1), and fibrinogen/fibrin, have been implicated in important roles contributing to tumor progression and therapeutic resistance. Specifically, it is hypothesized that the thrombin-PAR1 signaling axis can be targeted to suppress PCC growth/invasion and CAF growth/fibrosis. In addition, thrombin-mediated fibrin deposition can be targeted to suppress the drug delivery barrier and immunosuppressive TAM activities, which suppresses anti-tumor T cell activities. This hypothesis will be tested mechanistically and evaluated for translational potential by pursuing the following two integrated aims: Aim 1) Mechanistic Research: Determine the contribution of the coagulation targets in the PDAC TME. Specifically, the team will determine the role of thrombin-PAR1 signaling axis to CAF-mediated fibrosis, thrombin-mediated fibrin deposition on drug resistance, and PAR1/fibrin on the immunosuppressive TME. Aim 2) Translational Research: Evaluate the pharmacological inhibition of the coagulation targets. Especially, the team will expand the mechanistic understanding from Aim 1 using patient- derived PDAC models with FDA-approved inhibitors of thrombin and PAR1, and fibrinogen depleting agents. The effects of pharmacological inhibition will feedback to Aim 1 to delineate the efficacy of inhibiting coagulation targets. The outcome of this research will establish a new mechanistic understanding of the role of coagulation activities in the PDAC TME. It will determine whether blockade of the coagulation is a promising strategy to reprogram the PDAC stroma and, ultimately, suppress PCC/CAF growth and improve drug delivery and efficacy.",Ablation;Animal Model;Biomimetics;Blood coagulation;Blood specimen;CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes;Cancer Cell Growth;Cancer Etiology;Cessation of life;Chemoresistance;Clinical;Coagulation Process;Collagen;Data;Deposition;Desmoplastic;Disease;Drug Delivery Systems;Drug resistance;Evaluation;Extracellular Matrix;Extracellular Matrix Proteins;FDA approved;Feedback;Fibrin;Fibrinogen;Fibroblasts;Fibrosis;Goals;Growth;Healthcare Systems;Hyaluronan;Immune;Knowledge;Lead;Libraries;Malignant Neoplasms;Malignant neoplasm of pancreas;Mediating;Molecular;Molecular Target;Outcome;Outcomes Research;PAR-1 Receptor;Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma;Patients;Peptide Hydrolases;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacology;Reagent;Reporting;Research;Resistance;Role;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;Survival Rate;Syndrome;System;T-Lymphocyte;Testing;Therapeutic;Thrombin;Tissue Model;Translating;Translational Research;Treatment outcome;Tumor-associated macrophages;base;clinically relevant;drug efficacy;efficacy validation;health care economics;improved;in vivo;inhibitor;novel strategies;pancreatic cancer cells;pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cell;pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma model;programs;recruit;standard of care;therapeutically effective;therapy resistant;translational potential;tumor;tumor growth;tumor microenvironment;tumor progression;tumor-immune system interactions;vascular inflammation;venous thromboembolism,Melissa L Fishel; Matthew J.

In addition, thrombin-mediated fibrin deposition can be targeted to suppress the drug delivery barrier and immunosuppressive TAM activities, which suppresses anti-tumor T cell activities. This hypothesis will be tested mechanistically and evaluated for translational potential by pursuing the following two integrated aims: Aim 1) Mechanistic Research: Determine the contribution of the coagulation targets in the PDAC TME. Specifically, the team will determine the role of thrombin-PAR1 signaling axis to CAF-mediated fibrosis, thrombin-mediated fibrin deposition on drug resistance, and PAR1/fibrin on the immunosuppressive TME. Aim 2) Translational Research: Evaluate the pharmacological inhibition of the coagulation targets. Especially, the team will expand the mechanistic understanding from Aim 1 using patient- derived PDAC models with FDA-approved inhibitors of thrombin and PAR1, and fibrinogen depleting agents. The effects of pharmacological inhibition will feedback to Aim 1 to delineate the efficacy of inhibiting coagulation targets. The outcome of this research will establish a new mechanistic understanding of the role of coagulation activities in the PDAC TME. It will determine whether blockade of the coagulation is a promising strategy to reprogram the PDAC stroma and, ultimately, suppress PCC/CAF growth and improve drug delivery and efficacy.",,Melissa L Fishel; Matthew J.

1U01CA256801-01,U01CA256801,10126626,2021,Optimizing Dual-Targeted and Dual-Armored CAR T Cells for Small Cell Lung Cancer,"ABSTRACT A patient's own T cells can be modified using gene therapy technology to express receptors, termed chimeric antigen receptors or CARs, which allow these immune T cells to recognize proteins on the tumor cell surface, and in turn allow these CAR modified T cells to recognize and kill the patient's own tumor cells. This approach has been successful in some hematological malignancies, however, it has not been successful to date in solid tumors including small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Two mechanisms by which SCLC may evade T cell-mediated killing are loss of expression of antigens, and suppression of T cell function in the tumor microenvironment. In this proposal, we will attempt to overcome these barriers by designing CAR T cells that target two SCLC antigens simultaneously, and that produce multiple factors (“armors”) that enhance T cell activity in solid tumors. We hypothesize that these dual-armored, dual targeted (DADT) CAR T cells will be more effective against SCLC than previous T cell-mediated and immune therapies. We have previously shown that CAR T cells targeted to either the antigen GD3 or to the antigen DLL3, both of which are expressed on the majority of small cell lung cancers, are capable of killing SCLC cells in preclinical systems. Additionally, we have developed multiple armored CAR T cells that secrete factors such as IL-18, or an antibody-derived single-chain variable fragment (scFv) that blocks the immune checkpoint receptor PD-1, or an scFv blocking the phagocytosis-inhibitory signal CD47 on tumor cells. All of these armors enhance CAR T cell activity in our in vivo model systems through different mechanisms. In Aim 1 of this proposal, we will generate CAR T cells targeting DLL3 and GD3 simultaneously, to overcome antigen heterogeneity and antigen loss in tumors as a means of escape from T cell-mediated killing. Simultaneously, in Aim 2, we will test pairs of armors to identify the pair that is the most effective at enhancing the activity of single antigen-targeted CAR T cells against SCLC in vivo in immunocompetent systems. We then analyze the immune cells in the SCLC tumor microenvironment following CAR T cell treatment to assess changes mediated by the armored CAR T cells. Ultimately, in Aim 3, we will combine these approaches to generate CAR T cells that recognize GD3 and DLL3 and produce multiple armors. These DADT CAR T cells for SCLC may be suitable for further preclinical testing in preparation for clinical trials beyond the scope of this proposal, representing a novel therapeutic approach to SCLC. Given our robust track record in CAR T cell clinical translation, we fully anticipate having new CAR T cells suitable for clinical trials at the conclusion of funding. Additionally, these novel CAR T cells may be used as tools to explore the interactions between T cells and the SCLC microenvironment.

Pathologically, BC is diagnosed as non-muscle-invasive (NMI) and muscle-invasive (MI) disease. Here we define early bladder lesions as NMIBC. Major clinical gaps in NMIBC include i) lack of mechanistic insights defining NMIBC progression, and ii) lack of platform for risk stratification of NMIBC that recur but never progress (“non-progressors”), from those that progresses into MIBC (“progressors”) and consequently demonstrate poor prognosis. The goal of our Center is to tackle this clinical issue by deciphering the underlying mechanisms restraining or promoting the progression of early lesions (Project 1 & 2), and to leverage this novel biology as candidate biomarkers to risk-stratify aggressive NMIBC (Project 3). This proposal seeks to shift the current research paradigm in the field of NMIBC, by proposing a conceptually innovative tug-of-war between a tumor- restraining (Project 1) and a tumor-promoting mechanism (Project 2) in determining the outcome of early bladder lesions/NMIBC in becoming “progressors” or “non-progressors” (Project 3). Clinically, why “non-progressors” often recur but seldom progress, and what are the driving forces advancing “progressors” into MIBC with poor survival remain fundamental questions in field. Our tug-of-war hypothesis with two opposing forces is conceptually different to most other studies, which primarily focus on one side of the coin. Further, the integration of knowledge from Project 1 and 2 as a unified spatial proteomics and transcriptomics map by the Shared Resource Core will reveal spatial and temporal relationships between distinct fibroblast populations with opposing functions, their physical interactions with tumor and immune cell clusters, as well as their relationship to the biomarkers from Project 3.

1R01CA241927-01A1,R01CA241927,9974147,2020,Tissue-Engineered Models of Microvessel-Mediated Glioblastoma Invasion,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is a uniformly fatal brain cancer with poor response to treatment and virtually inevitable recurrence. GBM tumors do not metastasize. Instead, they aggressively infiltrate the brain. Tumor borders are highly vascularized by microvessels that serve as key niche environments promoting GBM cell survival, treatment resistance and migration. Currently, it is believed that a subpopulation of treatment-resistant, stem- like GBM cells (GSCs) migrate away from primary tumors — remaining in close contact with local microvessels — and seed recurrent tumors — which are enriched in GSCs. However, the mechanisms underlying the influence of the microvessel niche on GBM cell migration away from primary tumors, leading to recurrence, remain largely unknown. To address this gap in knowledge, the proposed studies will investigate 1) the role of specific cues in the tumor microenvironment on the migratory phenotype of GBM cells and 2) how these cues differentially affect distinct subpopulations of cells within heterogeneous tumors, including GSCs. Our fundamental hypothesis is that the microenvironment surrounding tumor microvessels promotes GBM progression through both mechanical and chemical means. Aim 1 will investigate effects of mechanical cues and Aim 2 effects of biochemical cues present in the microvessel niche on migratory phenotype of GBM. To do this, we will use an innovative, tissue- engineered platform for 3D culture of patient-derived GBM cells to quantify how specific features of the microenvironment affect migratory behavior. We propose to modularly tune mechanical and chemical properties of culture platforms to characterize their independent effects on migratory phenotype of GBM. For some experiments, platforms will be constructed with an interface between defined microenvironments through which GBM cells can migrate, enabling separation of migratory and non-migratory cells for downstream analysis and providing information about how subpopulations of cells within a single tumor, such as GSCs, may respond differentially to microenvironmental cues. As treatment resistance, invasion and recurrence are inter-related events, we will investigate how exposure to routine clinical therapies may alter migratory responses of GBM to microenvironmental cues.

5R01CA241927-02,R01CA241927,10105312,2021,Tissue-Engineered Models of Microvessel-Mediated Glioblastoma Invasion,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is a uniformly fatal brain cancer with poor response to treatment and virtually inevitable recurrence. GBM tumors do not metastasize. Instead, they aggressively infiltrate the brain. Tumor borders are highly vascularized by microvessels that serve as key niche environments promoting GBM cell survival, treatment resistance and migration. Currently, it is believed that a subpopulation of treatment-resistant, stem- like GBM cells (GSCs) migrate away from primary tumors — remaining in close contact with local microvessels — and seed recurrent tumors — which are enriched in GSCs. However, the mechanisms underlying the influence of the microvessel niche on GBM cell migration away from primary tumors, leading to recurrence, remain largely unknown. To address this gap in knowledge, the proposed studies will investigate 1) the role of specific cues in the tumor microenvironment on the migratory phenotype of GBM cells and 2) how these cues differentially affect distinct subpopulations of cells within heterogeneous tumors, including GSCs. Our fundamental hypothesis is that the microenvironment surrounding tumor microvessels promotes GBM progression through both mechanical and chemical means. Aim 1 will investigate effects of mechanical cues and Aim 2 effects of biochemical cues present in the microvessel niche on migratory phenotype of GBM. To do this, we will use an innovative, tissue- engineered platform for 3D culture of patient-derived GBM cells to quantify how specific features of the microenvironment affect migratory behavior. We propose to modularly tune mechanical and chemical properties of culture platforms to characterize their independent effects on migratory phenotype of GBM. For some experiments, platforms will be constructed with an interface between defined microenvironments through which GBM cells can migrate, enabling separation of migratory and non-migratory cells for downstream analysis and providing information about how subpopulations of cells within a single tumor, such as GSCs, may respond differentially to microenvironmental cues. As treatment resistance, invasion and recurrence are inter-related events, we will investigate how exposure to routine clinical therapies may alter migratory responses of GBM to microenvironmental cues.

However, the late effects of cancer treatment, including permanent organ and tissue damage, hormonal and reproductive dysfunction and second cancers, are of special concern, with more than 40% of the estimated 360,000 survivors of childhood cancer experiencing a significant health-related quality of life complication from childhood cancer and its treatment. In addition, progress for a number of childhood cancers remains limited with approximately 50% of children with acute myelogenous leukemia, 50% of children with high-risk neuroblastoma, and more than 90% of children with brainstem glioma, still succumbing to their disease. The Children’s Oncology Group (COG), the world’s largest organization devoted exclusively to childhood and adolescent cancer research, and its multidisciplinary research teams comprised of more than 9,000 members, conducts research at more than 220 leading children’s hospitals, universities, and cancer centers. This proposal is for the COG NCI Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP) Research Base to continue its collaborative research work for our 26 community and 16 minority/underserved NCORP sites. With COG’s significant scientific, statistical, data management and information technology infrastructure, we seek to conduct pediatric clinical trials to define optimal treatments, and conduct laboratory research that will translate into more effective treatments with reduced side effects. The COG directly addresses the NCORP goals of providing access to state-of-the-art cancer treatment at community sites while conducting research in cancer control, including post-treatment surveillance/survivorship, and cancer care delivery. We promote the participation of community-based investigators in all of COG’s research, governance and administration and in NCORP Network activities.

1U24CA220325-01A1,U24CA220325,9507097,2018,VU PREDICT,"Project Summary This application proposes a new U24 Oncology Co-Clinical Imaging Resource entitled VU-PREDICT (Vanderbilt University-PET imaging Resource to Enhance Delivery of Individualized Cancer Therapeutics). Precision cancer medicine, which seeks to exploit unique cellular, molecular and genetic characteristics of individual tumors to optimize treatment, remains a critically unmet need. Despite advances in biomarker technologies that yield high-quality cellular and genomic data, critical gaps remain to consistently match patients with cancer and ideal therapies. While `predictive' genomic assays based on RNA and DNA are now commonplace, current methods largely ignore tumor phenotypes differentiable by quantitative imaging. The overarching vision for VU-PREDICT is a suite of quantitative imaging tools that facilitate the discovery of novel, predictive imaging-derived gene expression signatures; such signatures can be deployed by the greater oncology community to improve the personalization of cancer treatment. The linchpin of VU-PREDICT will be positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. The sensitive and quantitative nature of PET, coupled with the ability to produce biologically active PET tracers, renders PET uniquely capable of both detecting tumors and profiling their specific features. Complementary to genomic approaches, PET imaging provides a quantitative, functional measure of tumor phenotype, and when coupled biopsy approaches, can provide a significantly greater breadth of biological characterization. VU-PREDICT centers on a parallel co-clinical trial of patients with advanced colorectal cancer (CRC) and human-in-mouse PDX (patient-derived xenograft) models. CRC is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs; cetuximab, panitumumab) are approved for treatment of advanced wild-type (WT) RAS CRC. However, durable responses to anti-EGFR mAbs occur in only 12–17% of patients. VU-PREDICT will capitalize upon a Phase I/II clinical trial opening at Vanderbilt combining a glutaminase (GLS1) inhibitor (CB-839, Calithera), EGFR mAb therapy (panitumumab) and irinotecan in patients with advanced and refractory WT RAS CRC. It is anticipated that combining CB-839 with EGFR mAb therapy will resensitize refractory CRC patients with Gln- avid tumors to EGFR blockade. VU-PREDICT will allow our development of quantitative PET imaging measures within this trial and in related preclinical studies that may identify patients likely to respond to combined GLS1/EGFR inhibition. We have four Specific Aims: (1) Optimize quantitative preclinical PET imaging protocols for Gln metabolism; Implement quantitative 18F-FSPG PET (2), 11C-Acetate PET (3), and dual-tracer 11C-Acetate/18F-FSPG PET (4) to discover predictive, imaging-derived gene expression signatures.",Acetates;Affect;Algorithms;Biological;Biological Assay;Biological Factors;Biological Markers;Biological Process;Biopsy;Cancer Etiology;Cancer Model;Cancer Patient;Cessation of life;Cetuximab;Characteristics;Chronobiology;Circadian Rhythms;Clinical;Clinical Trials;Colorectal Cancer;Community Clinical Oncology Program;Coupled;DNA;Data;Data Analyses;Development;Diet;Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor;Gene Expression Profile;Genomic approach;Glutaminase;Glutamine;Histologic;Human;Image;Imaging Device;Individual;Knowledge;Lead;Ligands;Location;MAP Kinase Gene;Malignant Neoplasms;Measures;Mediating;Metabolism;Methods;Molecular;Molecular Genetics;Monoclonal Antibodies;Monoclonal Antibody Therapy;Mus;Nature;Outcome;Patients;Phase;Phenotype;Positron-Emission Tomography;Protocols documentation;RNA;Radiochemistry;Receptor Inhibition;Refractory;Regimen;Reproducibility;Research;Resistance;Resources;Standardization;TP53 gene;Technology;Therapeutic;Tracer;Universities;Validation;Vision;Xenograft Model;Xenograft procedure;attenuation;base;clinical imaging;colon cancer patients;experience;genomic data;genomic predictors;imaging modality;improved;inhibitor/antagonist;irinotecan;mouse model;neutralizing monoclonal antibodies;novel;oncology;panitumumab;personalized cancer therapy;pre-clinical;precision oncology;preclinical study;predicting response;quantitative imaging;reconstruction;response;subcutaneous;targeted treatment;tool;treatment optimization;tumor,Jordan D Berlin; Henry Charles Manning,Huiming Zhang,664613,664613,2018-09-14T12:09:00Z,2018-09-14T12:09:00Z,2023-08-31T12:08:00Z,PAR-16-385,nofo_PAR-16-385,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,NASHVILLE,tn,UNITED STATES,cirp,org_state,True

Precision cancer medicine, which seeks to exploit unique cellular, molecular and genetic characteristics of individual tumors to optimize treatment, remains a critically unmet need. Despite advances in biomarker technologies that yield high-quality cellular and genomic data, critical gaps remain to consistently match patients with cancer and ideal therapies. While `predictive' genomic assays based on RNA and DNA are now commonplace, current methods largely ignore tumor phenotypes differentiable by quantitative imaging. The overarching vision for VU-PREDICT is a suite of quantitative imaging tools that facilitate the discovery of novel, predictive imaging-derived gene expression signatures; such signatures can be deployed by the greater oncology community to improve the personalization of cancer treatment. The linchpin of VU-PREDICT will be positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. The sensitive and quantitative nature of PET, coupled with the ability to produce biologically active PET tracers, renders PET uniquely capable of both detecting tumors and profiling their specific features. Complementary to genomic approaches, PET imaging provides a quantitative, functional measure of tumor phenotype, and when coupled biopsy approaches, can provide a significantly greater breadth of biological characterization. VU-PREDICT centers on a parallel co-clinical trial of patients with advanced colorectal cancer (CRC) and human-in-mouse PDX (patient-derived xenograft) models. CRC is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs; cetuximab, panitumumab) are approved for treatment of advanced wild-type (WT) RAS CRC. However, durable responses to anti-EGFR mAbs occur in only 12–17% of patients. VU-PREDICT will capitalize upon a Phase I/II clinical trial opening at Vanderbilt combining a glutaminase (GLS1) inhibitor (CB-839, Calithera), EGFR mAb therapy (panitumumab) and irinotecan in patients with advanced and refractory WT RAS CRC.

ZAMDAPP will, for the first time, provide a mechanism by which R01-style research projects led by Zambian scientists trained through the Fogarty International AIDS International Research and Training Program (AITRP, D43TW001429) and AIDS Malignancies Training and Research Program (AMTRP, D43TW010354) may be conducted in three areas critical to cancer research – virology, biostatistics and epidemiology, and cancer diagnostics. The Zambian personnel leading the research projects will benefit from mentoring by U.S. partners and support by a number of research core facilities. ZAMDAPP will leverage strengths in clinical care and treatment at CDH and UTH; strengths in molecular viral oncology research and cancer genomics at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln; and strengths in pathology, epidemiology, and biostatistics at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, while extending the work that has been accomplished through AITRP and AMTRP, which provide support for trainees to pursue advanced degrees. In addition to providing research funding, ZAMDAPP will provide diverse training activities in the United States and Zambia to engage the next generation of Zambian cancer researchers, increase local expertise, and enhance the transfer of technology. The partnership will lead to exchanges that build the technical and personnel infrastructure necessary to perform the high-quality and sustainable cancer research desperately needed in Zambia. Three specific aims will be accomplished: 1) develop the cancer research infrastructure at UTH and CDH through the establishment and enhancement two research core facilities; 2) provide an opportunity for former Fogarty trained fellows to lead hypothesis-driven research projects in the two more prevalent AIDS-associated malignancies, KS and OSSN, with the support of the U.S. partners and the core facilities; and 3) develop a pipeline of next generation Zambian cancer researchers through a) in-country workshops, b) pilot project funding, and c) short-term U.S. technical training. ZAMDAPP will build on successful ongoing Fogarty and National Cancer Institute training programs led by the PI and the leadership team in sub-Saharan Africa; implement a cross-disciplinary research and training program with different training tracks and in-country research projects that pair Zambian and U.S. researchers along with opportunities to conduct hypothesis-driven research projects; and be Zambian driven and benefit from broad local support.

5U54CA221204-07,U54CA221204,10581802,2022,Zambia AIDS Malignancies Diagnosis and Pathogenesis Program Supplement,"ABSTRACT The establishment of the Zambia AIDS Malignancies Diagnosis and Pathogenesis Program (ZAMDAPP) will support the U.S.-Zambia collaborations necessary to develop a robust cancer research infrastructure at Zambia’s Cancer Diseases Hospital (CDH) and University Teaching Hospital (UTH), with an initial focus on Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS) and ocular surface squamous neoplasia (OSSN) – two of the most common occurring HIV/AIDS-associated malignancies in the country. ZAMDAPP will, for the first time, provide a mechanism by which R01-style research projects led by Zambian scientists trained through the Fogarty International AIDS International Research and Training Program (AITRP, D43TW001429) and AIDS Malignancies Training and Research Program (AMTRP, D43TW010354) may be conducted in three areas critical to cancer research – virology, biostatistics and epidemiology, and cancer diagnostics. The Zambian personnel leading the research projects will benefit from mentoring by U.S. partners and support by a number of research core facilities. ZAMDAPP will leverage strengths in clinical care and treatment at CDH and UTH; strengths in molecular viral oncology research and cancer genomics at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln; and strengths in pathology, epidemiology, and biostatistics at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, while extending the work that has been accomplished through AITRP and AMTRP, which provide support for trainees to pursue advanced degrees. In addition to providing research funding, ZAMDAPP will provide diverse training activities in the United States and Zambia to engage the next generation of Zambian cancer researchers, increase local expertise, and enhance the transfer of technology. The partnership will lead to exchanges that build the technical and personnel infrastructure necessary to perform the high-quality and sustainable cancer research desperately needed in Zambia. Three specific aims will be accomplished: 1) develop the cancer research infrastructure at UTH and CDH through the establishment and enhancement two research core facilities; 2) provide an opportunity for former Fogarty trained fellows to lead hypothesis-driven research projects in the two more prevalent AIDS-associated malignancies, KS and OSSN, with the support of the U.S. partners and the core facilities; and 3) develop a pipeline of next generation Zambian cancer researchers through a) in-country workshops, b) pilot project funding, and c) short-term U.S. technical training. ZAMDAPP will build on successful ongoing Fogarty and National Cancer Institute training programs led by the PI and the leadership team in sub-Saharan Africa; implement a cross-disciplinary research and training program with different training tracks and in-country research projects that pair Zambian and U.S. researchers along with opportunities to conduct hypothesis-driven research projects; and be Zambian driven and benefit from broad local support.

To evaluate their potential for translation, we will integrate these dynamic models with clinical trials that will evaluate whether these phenotypic changes can be targeted for therapy. We hypothesize that acquired resistance emerges from selection acting on phenotypes during tumor evolution, and that simultaneously measuring and modeling subclone genotypes and phenotypes will identify new, and testable, therapeutic targets. Selective pressures from therapy and the tumor microenvironment can propel subclones from every patient's tumor along an evolutionary trajectory that leads to resistance. Indeed, our data shows that both genetic and phenotypic diversity among tumor subclones evolves as cancer cells progress to a resistant state. However, it is not yet known the specific phenotypes that promote that resistant state, the interactions among them, and how they converge to common resistant phenotypes seen in late stage cancer. To address these and other questions, we will develop a new class of dynamical systems models of subclone evolution to characterize the changes and development of key cell states that arise during acquired chemo-resistance and metastasis using our unique patient cohorts. These mechanistic models will identify points of therapeutic vulnerability that we will test in clinical trials aimed at blocking evolution to a resistant state by targeting critical resistant phenotypes. Our Center is comprised of an Administrative, Education/Outreach, Translational, and Computational Cores, in addition to two complementary projects. The synergies are derived from: 1) the convergent parameterization of the evolutionary models drawn from deep longitudinal patient progression studies (Project 1) and broad multisite metastatic tumor analyses (Project 2), resulting in a robust model to identify resistant states for clinical targeting; and 2) an integrated computational and experimental framework and resources for dissecting tumor heterogeneity and evolution that will contribute to an improved capacity for personalized cancer therapy. Our multidisciplinary team of systems biologists, bioinformaticians, tumor biologists, pharmacologists, mathematical biologists, and clinicians will tackle these scientific challenges. We will create programs to educate the next generation of scientists in systems biology and inform the community about the latest scientific advances and their impact on treatment strategies. And we will provide state of the art tools for the analysis of patient samples and tumor genomic complexity. These studies move beyond prior research by integrating cell population dynamics and cellular phenotypes with cellular genotypes, and will deliver approaches and a knowledge base to block or reverse the transition to a resistant state for advanced stage cancer patients. interact in the progression toward chemoresistant breast and ovarian cancer",Address;Behavior;Biological Models;Biological Pharmacology;Biological Process;Breast;Cancer Patient;Cells;Clinical;Clinical Treatment;Clinical Trials;Clonal Evolution;Clonality;Collection;Communities;Community Outreach;Complex;DNA;Data;Development;Drug Targeting;Drug resistance;Education and Outreach;Educational Activities;Evolution;Faculty;Generations;Genetic;Genetic Transcription;Genomics;Genotype;Goals;Heterogeneity;Individual;Institutes;Knowledge;Malignant Neoplasms;Malignant neoplasm of ovary;Mathematics;Measures;Methodology;Modeling;Mutation;Neoplasm Metastasis;Oncogenic;Ovarian;Pathway interactions;Patients;Pharmacology;Pharmacology Study;Pharmacotherapy;Phenotype;Population Dynamics;Population Heterogeneity;Postdoctoral Fellow;Prevention program;Refractory;Regimen;Research;Research Infrastructure;Research Project Grants;Resistance;Resources;Sampling;Science;Scientific Advances and Accomplishments;Scientist;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;Site;Solid;Somatic Mutation;System;Systems Analysis;Systems Biology;Testing;Therapeutic;Translations;Variant;base;cancer cell;cohort;combat;computerized tools;data sharing;dynamic system;effective therapy;experimental study;improved;innovation;knowledge base;malignant breast neoplasm;member;multidisciplinary;neoplastic cell;next generation;novel drug combination;outreach program;personalized cancer therapy;predictive modeling;pressure;prevent;programs;student training;synergism;targeted treatment;therapeutic target;tool;transcriptomics;treatment response;treatment strategy;tumor;tumor heterogeneity;tumor microenvironment,Andrea Hope Bild,Shannon K Hughes,474644,474644,2017-05-09T12:05:00Z,2017-05-15T12:05:00Z,2017-09-30T12:09:00Z,RFA-CA-15-014,nofo_RFA-CA-15-014,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,SALT LAKE CITY,ut,UNITED STATES,csbc,org_state,True

7U54CA209978-02,U54CA209978,9482409,2017,Combating Subclonal Evolution of Resistant Cancer Phenotypes,"Overall abstract Our Cancer Systems Biology Center of HoPE (Heterogeneity of Phenotypic Evolution) will develop a suite of systems-based methodologies to understand how genomic diversity, clonal evolution, and phenotypic change . To evaluate their potential for translation, we will integrate these dynamic models with clinical trials that will evaluate whether these phenotypic changes can be targeted for therapy. We hypothesize that acquired resistance emerges from selection acting on phenotypes during tumor evolution, and that simultaneously measuring and modeling subclone genotypes and phenotypes will identify new, and testable, therapeutic targets. Selective pressures from therapy and the tumor microenvironment can propel subclones from every patient's tumor along an evolutionary trajectory that leads to resistance. Indeed, our data shows that both genetic and phenotypic diversity among tumor subclones evolves as cancer cells progress to a resistant state. However, it is not yet known the specific phenotypes that promote that resistant state, the interactions among them, and how they converge to common resistant phenotypes seen in late stage cancer. To address these and other questions, we will develop a new class of dynamical systems models of subclone evolution to characterize the changes and development of key cell states that arise during acquired chemo-resistance and metastasis using our unique patient cohorts. These mechanistic models will identify points of therapeutic vulnerability that we will test in clinical trials aimed at blocking evolution to a resistant state by targeting critical resistant phenotypes. Our Center is comprised of an Administrative, Education/Outreach, Translational, and Computational Cores, in addition to two complementary projects. The synergies are derived from: 1) the convergent parameterization of the evolutionary models drawn from deep longitudinal patient progression studies (Project 1) and broad multisite metastatic tumor analyses (Project 2), resulting in a robust model to identify resistant states for clinical targeting; and 2) an integrated computational and experimental framework and resources for dissecting tumor heterogeneity and evolution that will contribute to an improved capacity for personalized cancer therapy. Our multidisciplinary team of systems biologists, bioinformaticians, tumor biologists, pharmacologists, mathematical biologists, and clinicians will tackle these scientific challenges. We will create programs to educate the next generation of scientists in systems biology and inform the community about the latest scientific advances and their impact on treatment strategies. And we will provide state of the art tools for the analysis of patient samples and tumor genomic complexity. These studies move beyond prior research by integrating cell population dynamics and cellular phenotypes with cellular genotypes, and will deliver approaches and a knowledge base to block or reverse the transition to a resistant state for advanced stage cancer patients. interact in the progression toward chemoresistant breast and ovarian cancer",,Andrea Hope Bild,Shannon K Hughes,1531573,1531573,2018-03-16T12:03:00Z,2017-05-15T12:05:00Z,2022-06-30T12:06:00Z,RFA-CA-15-014,nofo_RFA-CA-15-014,BECKMAN RESEARCH INSTITUTE/CITY OF HOPE,DUARTE,ca,UNITED STATES,csbc,org_state,False

These efforts have uncovered a staggering level of genome complexity in cancer. Although much is known about the function and clinical impact of recurrent aberrations in well-known cancer genes, less is known about which and how the more abundant, low-frequency mutations contribute to tumor progression. Effective translation of tumor genomic datasets into cancer therapeutics will require new experimental systems to inform the functional activity of targets in the relevant biological context encompassing inter- and intra-tumoral heterogeneity. To address these needs, we propose a CTD2 Center that will provide the research community high-throughput informatic and experimental approaches to characterize and validate pathogenic “driver” mutations and fusion genes as well as identify molecular markers that meaningfully predict responses or resistance to anticancer therapies. We will pursue the following Specific Aims: In Aim 1 we will implement an algorithmic framework for identifying driver mutations with high sensitivity and specificity. We will focus our algorithm development, training and testing efforts on predicting oncogenic, gain-of-function mutation drivers of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). These computational approaches will be amenable to the analysis of all cancer types. We will next engineer ~1,500 selected mutations and ~400 fusion genes into expression vectors along with cohorts of personalized, patient-defined coding mutations. In Aim 2 we will enter mutant alleles and fusion genes into GBM, PDAC and EOC context-specific, in vivo functional screens that take into account the importance of genetic context, tumor microenvironment and heterogeneity in the selection of single and combinatorial drivers of tumorigenesis. In Aim 3 we will determine the consequences of intra-tumoral heterogeneity on tumor sensitivity and resistance to therapeutic agents using DNA-barcoded, human patient-derived xenograft models that recapitulate the heterogeneity of cancer. We will determine the extent to which single targeted agents and their rational combinations alter tumor population dynamics. We will also leverage Aim 1 informatics and functional characterizations in Aim 2 and 4 to characterize “persistor” populations to identify aberrations associated with drug resistance. In Aim 4 we will use high-throughput functional proteomics, innovative protein- protein interaction assays and informer drug library screening studies to elucidate underlying mechanisms and therapeutic liabilities engendered by validated drivers.

1R21CA112149-01,R21CA112149,6861456,2005,Automated Cell Preparation in Tubes for 3D Microscopy,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): 3D microscopy represents a powerful new cell analysis tool for early detection and diagnosis of cancer, but its future use may be limited because methods for preparation of samples are cumbersome, inefficient, labor intensive and generally imprecise. Current methods for cytological sample collection are manual and distributed in nature through various physicians' office laboratories and local hospitals, with the actual analysis being centralized at regional clinical laboratories. Among the cytological specimens are sputum, gynecological and colorectal scrapes, fine needle aspirates, urinary tract, and gastrointestinal samples. We propose the development of a new automated system that will transform these difficult and messy clinical specimens into an optimal format for 3D microscopy morphological and molecular analysis. The model and method we propose is comprised of three sequential steps. First, at the distributed site, an automated sample processor dissociates and fixes cells and debris for shipment in an automation compatible canister. Second, after shipment to a centralized clinical laboratory, the specimen canisters are loaded into an automatic processor that performs cleanup (debris removal), specimen/assay specific staining (and counterstaining), and finally embedding of cells of interest in glass microcapillary tubes (about 50 mu m ID), with cells being spaced at regular intervals (about 200 mu m) within a tube. This preparation format is uniquely suited for integration with multiple 3D imaging platforms for true 3D volumetric assessment of cell morphology and molecular probe and/or stain density distribution. The proposed system also enables use of cytometric flow sorting for enrichment of cells of interest at an intermediate stage of the sample preparation process. The potential impact to improved human health through rapid diagnostic screening will be illustrated using a high impact emerging technology, optical tomography. In summary, the aim of the proposed project is to develop, design, and build a complete sample processing system that automates the process of sample cleanup, assay specific staining, and mounting of cells into glass microcapillary tubes, and a tube positioning and rotation scanner mechanism for 3D microscopy analysis of cell morphology for the early detection of cancer.",bioimaging /biomedical imaging;biomedical automation;cell morphology;clinical research;cytodiagnosis;early diagnosis;flow cytometry;high throughput technology;human tissue;molecular probes;neoplasm /cancer diagnosis;technology /technique development;three dimensional imaging /topography;tissue /cell preparation,Deirdre R.

1R21CA114135-01,R21CA114135,6913033,2005,Nanoscale Electrocatalytic Protein Detection,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal focuses on a novel system for the electrochemical detection of cancer related protein targets using a nanoscale electrode platform. The assay proposed relies on an electro catalytic process involving two transition-metal ions that reports on biomolecular complexation events. Because the reporter system responds to changes in the electrostatics of an electrode surface, it will enable the analysis of nucleic acids/protein and peptide/protein complexes. The proposed project has 3 specific aims: 1) electro catalytic detection of DNA repair proteins implicated in cancer using DNA-modified electrodes; 2) optimization of electro catalytic detection and multiplexed analysis of cellular DNA repair activities, and 3) development of a generalized electro catalytic protein detection method using prostate cancer biomarkers. The electro catalytic protein detection system described is advantageous because it will allow the analysis and discrimination of multiprotein complexes in addition to uncomplexed analytes and will have high selectivity and specificity. Additionally, the protein detection assays will be conducted using nanoelectrodes that will allow multiplexed detection of panels of different biomolecular targets.",DNA binding protein;DNA repair;biomarker;biotechnology;carbonates;electrochemistry;electrodes;high throughput technology;nanotechnology;oligonucleotides;prostate neoplasms;prostate specific antigen;protein quantitation /detection;synthetic nucleotide;technology /technique development,Shana O Kelley,John R Knowlton,154500,154500,2005-06-21T12:06:00Z,2005-06-21T12:06:00Z,2007-05-31T12:05:00Z,RFA-CA-05-002,nofo_RFA-CA-05-002,BOSTON COLLEGE,CHESTNUT HILL,ma,UNITED STATES,imat,org_state,False
1R21CA114852-01,R21CA114852,6913103,2005,Profile serum proteins by glycopeptide capture and LC-MS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancers develop over a period of several years and they are characterized by molecular changes prior to invasion and metastasis. Development of a technology that enables screening of cancer from body fluids could permit cancer detection at early and treatable stages. It is expected that the composition of the serum proteome contains valuable information about the state of the human body in health and disease, and that this information can be extracted via quantitative proteomic measurements. Suitable proteomic techniques need to be sensitive, reproducible and robust, to detect potential biomarkers below the level of highly expressed proteins, to generate data sets that are comparable between experiments and laboratories, and have high throughput to support studies with sufficient statistical power. In this proposal, we will develop a method for high throughput quantitative analysis of serum proteins. It consists of the selective isolation of the peptides that are N-linked glycosylated in the intact protein using solid-phase extraction of glycopeptides (SPEG) on a robotic workstation, the analysis of these now de-glycosylated peptides by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS), and the comparative analysis of the resulting patterns. By focusing selectively on a few formerly N-linked glycopeptides per serum protein, the complexity of the analyte sample is significantly reduced, and the sensitivity, reproducibility, and throughput of serum proteome analysis are increased compared with the analysis of total tryptic peptides from unfractionated samples. We will explore the feasibility to identify cancer-specific serum proteins in the background of normal variation using a carcinogen-induced skin cancer mouse model. The specific aims are: 1) To develop chemistries and protocols for an automatic robotic system to isolate N-linked glycopeptides from serum in a high throughput and highly reproducible fashion; 2) To develop efficient and reproducible procedures for LC-MS analyses, and sequence identification of discriminatory peptides by tandem mass spectrometry; 3) To explore the feasibility of this method for the identification of distinctive serum peptides specific to cancer-bearing mice in the background of normal variations. If successful, the proposed research could subsequently be used for profiling human serum samples from cancer patients and normal individuals to identify the cancer-associated proteins in serum. The identified biomarkers will open a new paradigm for performing screening and detection of human cancer at early stage and for clinical therapeutic management.",biomarker;biomedical automation;biotechnology;blood proteins;glycopeptides;high throughput technology;laboratory mouse;liquid chromatography mass spectrometry;neoplasm /cancer diagnosis;proteomics;technology /technique development,Hui Zhang,John R Knowlton,167650,167650,2005-06-13T12:06:00Z,2005-06-13T12:06:00Z,2007-05-31T12:05:00Z,RFA-CA-05-002,nofo_RFA-CA-05-002,INSTITUTE FOR SYSTEMS BIOLOGY,SEATTLE,wa,UNITED STATES,imat,org_state,False
1R21CA116060-01,R21CA116060,6962117,2005,REVERSIBLE PROMOTER-INSERTION FOR IN VIVO STUDIES OF MELANOMA,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is commonly accepted that the processes underlying the development of cancer are best modeled in vivo. A plethora of methods have been developed for genetic dissection of biological processes in somatic cells in culture; however, the adaptation of these techniques to in vivo use has been very limited. Our earlier experience indicates that reversible promoter-insertion mutagenesis offers a number of advantages over the currently used forward genetics techniques for cultured cells. The most important benefits are the dominant nature of the mutations, and the ease of identifying the affected gene and establishing the causal link between the mutation and the phenotype. The principal limitation for the adaptation of this technique to in vivo studies is the delivery of the insertional mutagen (typically, a retroviral vector) to the desired cell type. Based on our recent experience and published data from others, we propose a method to circumvent this limitation via the use of specially engineered transposon vectors. We propose to apply our technique to study the genetic events underlying melanoma development. We will screen for genetic events that cooperate with oncogenic Ras (commonly found in melanomas) in this process. We will confirm the properties of the proposed insertional mutagens in culture and then proceed to establish mouse strains suitable for mutagenesis. Upon verifying the properties of our constructs in vivo, we will selectively mutagenize melanocytes in transgenic animals and will test the functional link between tumorigenesis and the inserted promoter. Confirmed hits will be the subject of future investigation, while the technique itself will become available for dissection of various biological phenomena in general and aspects of tumorigenesis, in particular.",biomarker;biotechnology;cell line;gene mutation;genetically modified animals;guanine nucleotide binding protein;laboratory mouse;melanocyte;melanoma;neoplasm /cancer genetics;oncogenes;technology /technique development;tetracyclines;tissue /cell culture;transfection /expression vector;transposon /insertion element,Eugene S Kandel,Jennifer A.

1R21CA118632-01A2,R21CA118632,7238922,2007,Defining the Multiple Myeloma Kinome,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gene profiling technology has enabled analysis of the transcriptome and proteome of tumor cells. This information has provided useful information with regard to molecular mechanisms that define the enhanced survival and proliferation of MM cells. However, an equally, if not more important, goal is to define those proteins that participate in signaling pathways active in MM cells and their supporting stroma. Enzymes that phosphorylate tyrosine, serins and threonine residues on other proteins play a major role in signaling cascades that determine cell cycle entry and survival in MM and the stromal cells that support them. In particular, knowing the signaling pathways that are active in MM cells and their supporting stroma will provide critical information for understanding MM cell survival in the BM. We have developed and are applying to purified cells a novel array-based strategy that allows the simultaneous detection of phosphorylation for 1152 different kinase substrates. Here we propose to apply this emerging technology to the analysis of phosphorylation-based cell signaling pathways in MM and their supporting stroma. This R21/R33 Phased Innovation application will be pursued in two phases. In the R21 phase of this application Aims 1 and 2 will validate that PepChip technology can be applied to MM cells and their microenvironment to reveal signaling alterations in MM. In Aim 3 of the R33 phase we will use PepChip technology to identify kinome alterations within the MM patient population that are correlated with clinical parameters such as relapse and chromosomal abnormalities associated with poor prognosis. In Aim 4 we will utilize an in vivo model that supports the growth of primary patient isolates in RAG2XGammaC mice to determine the effect of therapeutics on the kinome of MM cells. This study will be pursued in the following.phased R21/R33 format: R21 Phase: Aim 1: Define the kinome of MM cells and normal plasma cells.

1R21CA123018-01,R21CA123018,7136805,2006,Epigenetic Targeting in Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hypermethylation of promoter CpG islands plays a prominent role in cancer. In partnership with alterations in histone acetylation/methylation, this epigenetic event establishes a repressive chromatin structure that leads to silencing of key cancer-related genes. The occurrence of DNA methylation within the genome is not random, but rather patterns of methylation are generated that are gene and tumor type specific. How DNA methylation patterns are established is still poorly understood. Since various transcriptional factors or regulators are found in association with DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) in vivo, we hypothesize that: 1) Oncogenic transcription factors can recruit DNMTs to target gene promoters and define a unique epigenetic signature in tumor cells; 2) Dissecting such complex epigenetic hierarchy will identify novel molecular targets for diagnosis, prognosis and therapeutic intervention. To test our hypothesis, we developed a high throughput technique for genome wide analysis of DNA methylation associated with specific proteins such as histones, transcription factors or any DNA binding proteins. The new approach named ChlP-Chop-DMH will combine both genome wide location analysis (also known as ChlP-on-Chip) and Differential Methylation Hybridization (DMH) analysis, two emerging technologies used in epigenetic research. The proposed method has distinct advantages over current protocols: first, this method directly examines the in vivo interaction of specific proteins with methylated DNA throughout the genome; second, this method may uncover novel biological properties of transcription factors; third, this method can be applied to discover novel epigenetic biomarkers relevant to tumorigenesis. In preliminary studies, we have verified the utility of this method with methylated histone H3 at lysine 9 and lysine 4 in human cancer cells. In the R21 phase, we will continue minor refinement of the method and pursue three aims: 1) Improve and optimize the ChlP-Chop-DMH method for analyzing genome wide association of DNA methylation with histone modification; 2) Utilize the proposed method to investigate the association of DNA methylation with chromatin remodeling factors: 3) Show proof-of-concept using the array to examine primary non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHLs). In this development phase we will focus on the sensitivity, reproducibility and accuracy of the proposed method. In the R33 phase, our goal is to utilize the technology to test biological hypotheses. We will fully implement the method and pursue these aims: 1) Discover epigenetic target genes associated with known oncogenic transcription factors c-Myc and BCL6: 2) Validate the identified epigenetic targets and investigate the regulatory role of the associated oncogenic transcription factors. This systematic approach will provide a powerful tool for future mechanistic studies as well as cancer diagnosis.",DNA;DNA methylation;chromatin;clinical research;epigenetics;gene targeting;genome;histones;lymphoma;methylation;neoplasm /cancer;proteins;transcription factor,Huidong Shi,Jennifer A.

1R21CA125398-01A1,R21CA125398,7291241,2007,The Kinomes of Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gene profiling technology has enabled analysis of the transcriptome and proteome of tumor cells. In fact, massively parallel analysis of the Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) transcriptome has revealed discrete gene profile signatures for the major subtypes of NHL, diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and follicular lymphoma (FL). This information has provided useful insights into molecular mechanisms that promote enhanced survival and proliferation in NHL. However, an equally, if not more important goal, is to define those proteins that participate in signaling pathways active in lymphoma cells and non-malignant cells that infiltrate these tumors. Enzymes that phosphorylate tyrosine, serine and threonine residues on other proteins play a major role in signaling cascades that control cell cycle entry, survival, angiogenesis and the immune response. Defining how these signaling pathways are altered in NHL B cells and non- malignant cells present in these tumors will provide critical information for understanding how lymphoma survives, proliferates and interacts with other cells at the tumor site. We are applying to purified tumor cells a novel array strategy that allows the simultaneous detection of phosphorylation for 1152 different kinase substrates. Here we propose to apply this emerging technology to the analysis of phosphorylation-based cell signaling pathways in NHL. This proposal will be pursued in two phases. The R21 phase will consist of two aims that will validate PepChip technology can identify kinome alterations in primary DLBCL (Aim 1) and FL (Aim 2) isolates. The R33 phase will consist of two aims that will define kinome alterations in DLBCL (Aim 3) and FL (Aim 4) that correlate with clinical parameters. In Aim 5 we will utilize in vivo models of FL and DLBCL to determine whether inhibitors specific for deregulated kinases inhibit growth of NHL tumors in immunodeficient mice. This study will be pursued in the following phased R21/R33 format: R21 Phase: Aim 1: Define the kinome of DLBCL B cells and non-malignant cells present in these tumors. Aim 2: Define the kinome of FL B cells and non-malignant cells present in these tumors. Aim 3: Identify kinome alterations in DLBCL correlated with clinical parameters of disease.

1R21CA132806-01,R21CA132806,7434635,2008,Standardized NanoArray PCR for Gene Expression Profiling of Lung Cancer,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Molecular characterization of cancer, in particular by gene transcription profiling, has great potential to improve prognosis, therapeutic selection and clinical outcomes. However, the potential for using expression signatures for cancer prognosis and treatment selection is hampered by lack of readily deployable test kits with the accuracy, low RNA requirement and inter-site concordance required for routine clinical use. We propose an innovative solution based on two well-validated PCR technologies whose combination uniquely addresses the problem of diagnostic assay reproducibility. Our plan is to implement Standardized RT (StaRT)-PCR, a proven competitive PCR method developed at the University of Toledo, in a novel nanofluidic PCR platform developed by BioTrove Inc. in order to streamline the fluidic workflow, improve measurement throughput, and at the same time reduce test cost and maintain low RNA input. As compared to existing hybridization or real-time qPCR approaches, Standardized NanoArray PCR (SNAP) will provide the same dynamic range and quality as RT-PCR, yet require less RNA input and be more readily clinically deployable. The development will entail step-wise integration of proven technologies. First, real-time qPCR TaqMan assays will be developed for 16 lung tumor prognostic genes. These assays will be converted to StaRT-PCR by creation of competitive template and a competitor specific dye-labeled probe. Adding a pre-amplification step to StaRT-PCR will reduce the RNA input requirements to enable thousands of tests per sample. Finally, moving the assays into the OpenArray nano-PCR plate will streamline fluid handling. Using RNA isolated from lung clinical tumor resections, dynamic range and precision equivalent to real-time qPCR will be demonstrated for the integrated platform. After the initial development phase is complete, we will compare SNAP and real time qPCR in two critical gene expression profiling experiments. First we will compare the minimum amount of RNA required for each method by monitoring loss of precision as a function of decreasing RNA sample input. Second we will demonstrate lower inter-site variability, a critical factor for deploy-ability, by measuring gene expression profiles of seven lung tumor resection samples in three laboratories. Meeting these Specific Aims will lead to seeking further funding for multi-site prognostic validation studies involving formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) lung specimens with extensive clinical history.",Address;Adoption;Biological Assay;Cancer Prognosis;Characteristics;Chemistry;Class;Clinical;Color;Consumption;Detection;Development;Diagnostic;Diagnostic Procedure;Diagnostic tests;Dyes;End Point;End Point Assay;Excision;Formalin;Freezing;Funding;Gene Expression;Gene Expression Profile;Gene Expression Profiling;Genes;Genetic Transcription;Genomics;Goals;Health;Label;Laboratories;Lead;Liquid substance;Lung;Lung Neoplasms;Malignant Neoplasms;Malignant neoplasm of lung;Measurement;Measures;Methods;Molecular;Molecular Diagnostic Testing;Molecular Profiling;Monitor;Morphologic artifacts;Nanoarray Analytical Device;Numbers;Operative Surgical Procedures;Outcome;Paraffin Embedding;Performance;Phase;Pliability;Polymerase Chain Reaction;Quality Control;RNA;Range;Recording of previous events;Reproducibility;Running;Sampling;Selection for Treatments;Site;Solutions;Specimen;Speed;Staging;Standards of Weights and Measures;System;Taq Polymerase;Technology;Testing;Therapeutic;Time;Universities;Validation;base;cost;design;improved;inhibitor/antagonist;innovation;malignant breast neoplasm;nano;nanofluidic;neoplastic;novel;nuclease;outcome forecast;prognostic;research study;tumor;validation studies,Tony E Godfrey; Tom B Morrison; James C.

1R21CA177395-01A1,R21CA177395,8664139,2014,A novel single-molecule telomere characterization technology for analyzing cancer,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Single-telomere-specific (TTAGGG)n tract lengths and instabilities cannot be measured globally using current methods; the ability to do so would be a major, transformative addition to the arsenal of tools for analyzing critical telomere loss an telomere elongation events in cancer. The shortest telomere or a small subset of the shortest telomeres in a cell will determine the onset of senescence, apoptosis, or genome instability; single (TTAGGG)n tracts are crucial for the function of telomeres and the biological effects of telomere attrition and dysfunction. Telomere loss, breakage, fusion, and rejoining are highly elevated in cancer, but current methods for detecting and measuring these mutational events at the molecular level are limited and low-throughput. The technology we propose to develop here would permit quantitative, single- allele-resolution measurements of telomere length and instability, enabling unprecedented insights into the role(s) telomere loss, telomere breakage/re-joining, and telomerase or ALT dependent telomere elongation play in carcinogenesis, including mechanistic insights into molecular events mediating these processes and translational insights for the potential prognostic and tumor stratification applicability of the methods. In this method, input genomic DNA is labeled with fluorescent dyes specific for (TTAGGG)n sequences and for linked subtelomeric DNA. The labeled individual DNA fragments are linearized (stretched) and imaged in the nano-channels of Bionano Genomics system at very high throughput. The lengths of the telomere are measured accurately and the distances between probes in the subtelomere region are determined accurately to infer the identity of the telomere. Our goals for this R21 study are to establish feasibility for (1) high-throughput single-molecule detection and quantitation of (TTAGGG)n tracts in genomic DNA samples and (2) subtelomere probe development and efficient co-labeling of telomeres and subtelomeres in the context of total genomic DNA, including conversion of the labeled DNA to double- stranded DNA suitable for nano-channel analysis; and (3) proof-of-principle results for the technology and its applicability for cancer research using data generated and analyzed for a normal and a cancer cell line. There are significant technical challenges inherent in this early-stage technology development project, but the extraordinary payoff for cancer research will be a high-throughput ability to probe mechanisms of telomere length regulation and telomere mutation at single-telomere resolution, in small (ultimately single-cell) samples of both dividing and non-dividing cells.",Alleles;Apoptosis;Bar Codes;Base Pairing;Biological;Biological Assay;Biology;Cancer cell line;Cells;Chromosomes;Collection;DNA;Data;Detection;Development;Diploidy;Event;Fibroblasts;Fluorescent Dyes;Functional disorder;Genome;Genomic DNA;Genomic Instability;Genomics;Goals;Human;Image;Individual;Interphase Cell;Label;Length;Link;Maintenance;Malignant Neoplasms;Measurement;Measures;Mediating;Methods;Miniaturization;Molecular;Mutation;Neoplasm Circulating Cells;Pattern;Performance;Play;Population;Process;Regulation;Resolution;Role;Sampling;Scheme;Signal Transduction;Site;Sorting - Cell Movement;Specificity;Staging;Stratification;Stretching;System;Technology;Telomerase;Testing;Time;anticancer research;base;cancer cell;cancer genome;cancer stem cell;carcinogenesis;design;ds-DNA;high throughput analysis;insight;nanochannel;neoplastic cell;novel;prognostic;public health relevance;research study;senescence;single molecule;technology development;telomere;tool;tumor,Harold Riethman; Ming Xiao,Jerry Li,304593,304593,2014-05-13T12:05:00Z,2014-05-13T12:05:00Z,2017-04-30T12:04:00Z,RFA-CA-13-001,nofo_RFA-CA-13-001,WISTAR INSTITUTE,PHILADELPHIA,pa,UNITED STATES,imat,org_state,True
1R21CA191186-01,R21CA191186,8810908,2015,Droplet Microfluidic Platform for Ultralow Input Epigenetics,"﻿ DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epigenomic analyses are playing increasingly prominent roles in the development of personalized strategies for treating cancer. However, the translation of fundamental epigenomic insight to the clinic is wrought with challenges. Take for example the study of post-translational histone protein modifications, which can serve to either promote or repress the transcription of pendant DNA sequences. Analyses of these critically important interactions bridge genomics and proteomics and present significant challenges in the clinical setting. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) is the method of choice for analyzing protein-DNA interactions and the basic method involves fragmentation of chromatin, separation of modified proteins using antibodies and magnetic beads, and subsequent analysis of the associated DNA by qPCR or sequencing. While sounding simple, a typical ChIP workflow involves ~30 steps, takes 4+ days, and requires 106-107 cells as input. These requirements significantly limit the applicability of ChIP in a clinical setting-particularly when minimal sampl is available, such as in the analysis of tumor biopsies, stem cells, or circulating tumor cells. Microfluidic devices offer many attractive benefits over traditional macro-scale methods including reduced volume requirements, parallelization capability, and automated operation, which make them particularly well- suited to sample-constrained epigenetic analyses. A handful of recent reports suggest a substantial opportunity for microfluidically-enabled ChIP analyses; however, there is still considerable room for further improvement. We propose to develop a powerful and versatile, droplet microfluidics-based, nanoliter-scale Chromatin ImmunoCapture (nChIC) platform suitable for individualized medicine applications. Droplet microfluidics offer several benefits, including rapid, controlled, and efficient fluid handling, and the capacity to handle variable sample sizes, since devices can accommodate larger samples by simply operating for longer periods of time. Our nChIC platform will incorporate every major step in the ChIP workflow into an automated device, including cell lysis, chromatin digestion, immunocapture, and DNA purification. Importantly, these processes will be carried out at the single cell level, which promises to provide unique insights into epigenomic tumor heterogeneity. Beyond single cells, the unprecedented ability to handle samples of variable input will also facilitate robust validation against traditional ChIP assays to demonstrate broad genomic coverage.

1R21CA193064-01,R21CA193064,8851376,2015,Cellular biofactories for therapeutic protein synthesis in tumor microenvironment,"﻿ DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): T cells undergo an intelligent decision-making process based on the inhibitory and excitatory chemotactic inputs; and extravagate to the tumor microenvironment through solid tissue barriers. Investigators' long-term goal, to be pursued in R33 phase, is to develop T cells into a platform vector technology for active drug- transport to the solid tumors. In this R21 application, their objective is to engineer a robust mechanism to transform autologous T cells into biofactories for autonomous synthesis of cytocidal secretory proteins upon stimulation by the tumor cells. Autonomous synthesis of Protein-of-Interest (PoI) with spatiotemporal resolution will enable targeting of tumor burden with cellular resolution and molecular specificity. Their central hypothesis is that T cells can be genetically encoded for robust modulation and biosynthesis of therapeutic proteins at the tumor site. They have chosen ovarian cancer that expresses Folate Receptor alpha (FRa) as disease model, and an apoptotic protein for its cytotoxic therapeutic value. However, the rationale for developing T cells as protein biofactories is that this is a platform technology and their specificity can be modified to target any cancer and autonomously synthesize any PoI in situ. To aid this R21 effort, they have developed cell lines expressing bioluminescent and fluorescent reporters expressed only when stimulated by tumor cells. With following specific aims, they will advance this project towards its goals: (1) To develop robust control on biosynthesis of protein-of-interest (PoI); (2) To develop T cells as biofactories for autonomous secretion of antitumor apoptotic protein. It is expected that this R21 phase will lead to T cells that will not activate in healthy tissues (enhanced safety) and hyperactivate specifically in the tumor microenvironment (enhanced efficacy). The impact of this research will also be felt on ongoing T-cell therapy trials by reducing the incidences of graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD). This pioneering approach builds upon ongoing T-cell immunotherapy trials, which are currently limited to control minimal residual disease (MRD) and is administered after chemotherapy. Proposed research is transformative, firstly because it will expand the scope of T-cell engineering to replace systemic chemotherapies. This will then be used for reduction of tumor burden rather than keeping MRD in check. Secondly, therapeutic proteins of non-human origin are efficiently degraded and removed by the immune system. This is a barrier to their in vivo application. The use of autologous T cells for biosynthesis of therapeutic proteins at the target site will eliminate any immunogenicity issues. Unusually high impact is expected because the specificity of T cells can be redirected towards the surface markers on different cancers and therefore be used to target multitude of cancers.",Address;Amidohydrolases;Anabolism;Antigen Targeting;Antigens;Apoptotic;Autologous;Cell Line;Cytoplasm;Decision Making;Development;Disease model;Drug Delivery Systems;Drug Transport;Engineering;Foundations;Future;Goals;IL6 gene;Immune system;Immunosuppressive Agents;Immunotherapy;In Situ;Incidence;Injection of therapeutic agent;Intercellular Fluid;Lead;Malignant Neoplasms;Malignant neoplasm of ovary;Mission;Molecular;Penicillin G;Permeability;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phase;Process;Prodrugs;Protein Biosynthesis;Proteins;Public Health;Regulation;Reporter;Reporting;Research;Research Personnel;Residual Neoplasm;Resolution;Response Elements;Safety;Site;Solid;Solid Neoplasm;Specificity;Surface;System;T cell response;T cell therapy;T-Cell Development;T-Cell Immunologic Specificity;T-Lymphocyte;Technology;Therapeutic;Therapy trial;Tissues;Transgenes;Tumor Antigens;Tumor Burden;Work;amidase;base;cellular engineering;chemotherapy;chimeric antigen receptor;cytotoxic;graft vs host disease;human FOLR1 protein;immunogenicity;in vivo;interest;nanoparticle;neoplastic cell;nuclear factors of activated T-cells;pressure;prevent;promoter;public health relevance;secretory protein;spatiotemporal;success;therapeutic protein;tumor;tumor microenvironment;tumor specificity;vector,Parijat Bhatnagar,Tawnya C Mckee,1,1,2015-05-19T12:05:00Z,2015-06-01T12:06:00Z,2015-06-02T12:06:00Z,RFA-CA-14-003,nofo_RFA-CA-14-003,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,HOUSTON,tx,UNITED STATES,imat,org_state,False
1R21CA196418-01,R21CA196418,8928922,2015,"Multiplexed, Quantitative Fluorescence Imaging in Tumor Sections","﻿ DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Precision medicine for cancer requires knowledge of the driver mutations in a particular patient's tumor. Recent single cell genetic studies have shown that driver mutations and cancer cell subtype are highly heterogeneous within a single patient. Thus, clinicians will need to employ experimental methods that allow observation of a variety of molecular analytes across many individual cells within a particular patient's tumor section in situ. Current tumor section analyses are not highly multiplexed and typically remain limited to ~4-5 analytes, or 7 with multi-spectral imaging. Recent technologies have pushed this number into 30s-60s, but they require expensive equipment and/or reagents, sophisticated analyses or markedly increased assay time, all of which would preclude their practical use in many clinical pathology and preclinical research laboratories. Thus, there remains a significant need for technologies that multiplex measurements in tumor sections but are widely accessible and cost-effective. We focus on addressing this need with a readily-adoptable but novel multi- spectral fluorescence-based method. It is based on the hypothesis that the power of combinatorics can be harnessed to vastly increase the number of quantifiable analytes in a mixture by permuting the wide array of available fluorophores in new ways. We term our approach combinatorial fluorescence with spectral imaging (CoFSI). CoFSI only requires the ability to perform multi-channel fluorescence excitation and emission spectral scanning, which is widely available and easy to implement in most plate/slide readers and many microscopes. Data analysis involves a straightforward, fast computational technique called linear unmixing. Preliminary simulation studies suggest that the concentrations of 123 different CoFSI probes constructed from 16 existing fluorescent proteins can be estimated simultaneously with good accuracy and precision across 3 orders of concentration magnitude with a large number of excitation channels, and 48 probes with 6 excitation channels. Similar simulation studies constrained by available tumor section imaging equipment and Alexa dyes suggest 25 simultaneous measurements are possible. Initial pilot experiments demonstrate that seven different CoFSI probe levels in a mixture can be measured both accurately and precisely using only the blue-yellow part of the spectrum. This proposal further tests the limits of CoFSI experimentally, and applies CoFSI to tumor section imaging, with two Aims: (1) Quantify the Levels of 48 Fluorescent Probes in a Mixture Simultaneously; and (2) Quantify the Spatial Distribution of 25 Analytes in Tumor Sections. If successful, CoFSI can increase quantitative fluorescence multiplexing at least ~5 to 10-fold while relying on standard lab resources and straightforward analyses. CoFSI is also feasibly compatible with other difficult-to-multiplex technologies such as high content screening, live-cell imaging, and in vivo rodent imaging, and thus may have broad impact.",Address;Antibodies;Antigens;Architecture;Area;Basic Science;Binding;Biological Assay;Biological Markers;Biopsy Specimen;Breast Cancer cell line;Cells;Chemicals;Classification;Clinic;Clinical Data;Clinical Pathology;Combinatorics;Computational Technique;Cytometry;Data;Data Analyses;Diagnostic;Dyes;Epitopes;Equipment;Escherichia coli;Fluorescence;Fluorescent Probes;Genetic study;Heterogeneity;Image;In Situ;In Situ Hybridization;Individual;Knowledge;Label;Laboratories;Life;Malignant Neoplasms;Measurement;Measures;Methods;Microscope;Molecular;Mus;Mutation;Nucleic Acids;Oncologist;Patients;Pharmacologic Substance;Principal Investigator;Proteins;Reader;Reagent;Research;Resolution;Resources;Rodent;Sample Size;Sampling;Scanning;Science;Slide;Solutions;Spatial Distribution;Staining method;Stains;System;Techniques;Technology;Testing;Time;Tissues;Translating;Writing;Xenograft procedure;Yeasts;base;cancer cell;cell type;cellular imaging;clinical decision-making;clinically relevant;combinatorial;cost effective;data acquisition;deep sequencing;drug development;fluorescence imaging;fluorophore;imaging modality;imaging probe;improved;in vivo;insight;malignant breast neoplasm;novel;optical spectra;outcome forecast;pre-clinical;pre-clinical research;precision medicine;public health relevance;research and development;research study;screening;simulation;spectrograph;treatment response;tumor;tumor microenvironment;tumor xenograft,Marc R.

1R21CA202831-01,R21CA202831,9036024,2016,Novel Bi-functional Inhibitors Blocking OncomiR Biogenesis,"﻿ DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this proposal is to develop a new class of selective miRNA regulators that blocks the maturation of oncomiRs. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate diverse biological processes. Dysregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) has become one of the emerging mechanisms contributes to cancer formation and progression. Increasing evidences suggest that certain miRNAs affect cellular transformation, carcinogenesis and metastasis, and act as oncogenes (oncogenic miRNAs or oncomiRs). Understanding the roles of oncomiRs in cancer will lead to the development of new cancer therapies. Besides, direct therapeutic intervention of oncomiRs has become a promising new direction for treating cancer. For both research and therapeutic purposes, methods allowing the control of oncomiR levels are highly desirable. Current methods for such purposes generally suffer from the off-target inhibition. To address this critical issue, we propose a novel strategy to regulate miRNA. We will develop a new class of bi-functional miRNA regulators consisting of independent and specialized ""pre-miRNA recognition unit"" and ""Dicer inhibition unit"" to target unique pre- miRNAs and block their processing to generate mature miRNAs by inhibiting Dicer enzymatic activity. The following Aims will accomplish our goal of establishing this new strategy: Aim 1. Synthesize and test bi- functional miRNA regulators. We will synthesize bi-functional regulators for miRNA-21 (miR-21) and other oncomiRs and test their inhibitory activity. Aim 2: Test the activity and specificity of the bi-functional miRNA regulator in cells. We will optimize cellular uptake of the regulator in mammalian cells. The cellular activity and off-target effects of the regulator will be evaluated in cells. This work will establish the technical foundation of a novel oncomiR regulation strategy. This unique technology will address the major obstacle encountered in current miRNA regulating methods and enhance the capability to dissect the roles of oncomiRs in cancer biology. It will significantly contribute to the advancement in our knowledge of the role played by oncomiRs in cancer and will result in the development of novel cancer therapies either directly based on the bi- modular regulators or evolved from the understanding of oncomiR functions unveiled by this new technology.",Address;Adverse effects;Affect;Affinity;Antisense Oligonucleotides;Binding;Biogenesis;Biological Assay;Biological Process;Cancer Biology;Cell physiology;Cells;Development;Dicer Enzyme;Foundations;Generations;Goals;In Vitro;Knowledge;Lead;Link;Malignant Neoplasms;Mammalian Cell;Messenger RNA;Methods;MicroRNAs;Neoplasm Metastasis;Northern Blotting;Oncogenes;Oncogenic;Pathogenesis;Play;Process;Proteins;RNA;Regulation;Research;Role;Specificity;Technology;Testing;Therapeutic Human Experimentation;Therapeutic Intervention;Untranslated RNA;Western Blotting;Work;base;cancer therapy;cancer type;carcinogenesis;design;improved;inhibitor/antagonist;interest;metaplastic cell transformation;new technology;next generation;novel;novel strategies;novel therapeutics;public health relevance;research and development;ribosome profiling;transcriptome sequencing;uptake,Fu-Sen Liang,John R Knowlton,185078,185078,2016-04-07T12:04:00Z,2016-05-01T12:05:00Z,2019-04-30T12:04:00Z,RFA-CA-15-002,nofo_RFA-CA-15-002,UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO,ALBUQUERQUE,nm,UNITED STATES,imat,org_state,False
1R21CA212726-01A1,R21CA212726,9368740,2017,A MOLECULAR TOOLKIT FOR THE PRODUCTION OF TYROSINE PHOSPHORYLATED PROTEINS,"Project Summary Tyrosine phosphorylation can regulate protein function, and this is a cornerstone of cell signaling networks. Ty- rosine phosphorylation often becomes dysregulated in cancer and therefore, understanding the effect of phos- phorylation on protein function will be paramount to identifying therapeutic interventions in cancer. Unfortunately, an important tool in the basic research of phosphorylation – testing the effect of protein phosphorylation by com- paring the function of the phosphorylated form with an unphosphorylated form of the protein in in vitro assays – is signiﬁcantly hindered by our limited knowledge in how to make a phosphorylated protein. This project seeks to build a molecular technology, inspired by previous observations of biochemistry in cell networks, to overcome this requirement and improve the pace of basic research. The goal of this research is to build a fast, accessible and inexpensive method for producing phosphorylated and soluble proteins in a bacterial system. The goals will be achieved by: development of a molecular toolkit for the enhancement and control of precise phosphorylation on protein substrates using secondary kinase-substrate targeting approaches, testing the toolkit on a set of sub- strates, and comparing the outcome with current technologies. It is anticipated that this technology will be less expensive, more physiologically-relevant, and capable of producing a larger variety of phosphorylated forms of proteins than current molecular approaches to studying the effect of protein phosphorylation.",Amino Acid Sequence;Automobile Driving;Basic Cancer Research;Basic Science;Binding;Biochemical;Biochemistry;Biological;Biological Assay;Cells;Darkness;Development;Engineering;Escherichia coli;Glutamic Acid;Goals;Grant;Human;Kinetics;Knowledge;Libraries;Malignant Neoplasms;Mass Spectrum Analysis;Measurement;Measures;Methods;Molecular;Molecular Bank;Mutate;Outcome;Pattern;Phosphoproteins;Phosphorylation;Phosphotransferases;Phosphotyrosine;Physiological;Post-Translational Protein Processing;Process;Production;Property;Proteins;Proteome;Recombinant Proteins;Recombinants;Regulation;Research;Research Personnel;SH3 Domains;Signal Transduction;Specificity;Substrate Domain;Substrate Specificity;System;Technology;Testing;Therapeutic Intervention;Thick;Tyrosine;Tyrosine Phosphorylation;Work;base;improved;in vitro Assay;polyproline;protein function;src Homology Region 2 Domain;technology development;tool;vector,Kristen M Naegle,John R Knowlton,228750,228750,2017-08-16T12:08:00Z,2017-08-16T12:08:00Z,2020-07-31T12:07:00Z,RFA-CA-16-001,nofo_RFA-CA-16-001,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,SAINT LOUIS,mo,UNITED STATES,imat,org_state,True
1R21CA229044-01,R21CA229044,9572744,2018,Novel platform linking cancer-specific glycosylation with cell signaling outcomes,ABSTRACT Abnormal glycosylation is a hallmark of many cancers that contributes to tumor growth and invasion. There are many protein receptors that are regulated abnormally in cancer due to mutations and/or alterations in glycosylation. Studies to link specific glycosylation changes to signaling outcomes have primarily focused on studies of individual receptors or specific pathways. Methods that can link forms of tumor-specific glycosylation to global effects on signaling pathway activation are needed to better identify potential new targets for therapeutics. To overcome this limitation we are employing the use of heterobifunctional molecule that will link cancer-specific glycosylation on protein receptors with a proximity- induced ubiquitination. To demonstrate the potential and applicability of this method we are using a novel scFv antibody that recognizes tumor-specific glycans present on ovarian cancer and glioblastoma cells that has been demonstrated to have excellent cell permeability. Combining the scFv with proteolysis targeting molecules will enable us to identify receptors and signaling changes using mass spectrometry methods.

1R21CA258013-01,R21CA258013,10174448,2021,Device for Preservation of Cell Free RNA in Saliva,"ABSTRACT Early detection is critical to cancer mortality reductions, and yet the breast imaging clinic visits required for these life-saving early detection programs are inaccessible to disadvantaged, remote, or quarantined populations with limited medical facility access. In fact, breast cancer surveillance programs this year have stalled by as much as 90% versus their pre-pandemic rates, resulting in risky delays in new cancer diagnosis [1]. A saliva-based test for early detection could transform today’s screening paradigms. A promising biofluid for disease detection, saliva can be self-sampled non-invasively, without trained technicians. Saliva is ideal for at-home and other non-clinical site collection; it contains a variety of analytes including exosomes, RNA, DNA, proteins, metabolites, viruses and oral microflora, and is a powerful window on health and disease. Recently, saliva samples have shown better clinical utility vs. nasal swabs for detecting COVID-19 [2]. Mounting evidence exists for oral microbiome links to systemic disease [3], and salivary biomarkers diagnose complex traits such as pediatric medical conditions, traumatic brain injury, autism, and cancer [4-7]. A commercial saliva-based test for autism is based on 32 human and microbial RNA markers [8]. In many complex trait studies, saliva is frozen as cell-free supernatant. The most prevalent saliva collection and preservation devices, although easy-to-use, preclude effective cell-free RNA and exosome analysis, since saliva samples are treated with lysis reagents resulting in mixed populations of cellular and non-cellular RNAs, increasing noise and damaging performance characteristics. Saliva collection devices that instead use membranes to separate cells suffer from inefficient recovery of critical analytes, either because they lack appropriate preservatives or because they adsorb and therefore lose, a substantial analyte fraction. To enable widespread use for disease detection, new standardized methods are needed to preserve cell-free saliva and retain the integrity of its key constituents for stable transport and downstream analysis. This project extends our past SBIR grant work and our own internal research, to develop an easy-to-use saliva collection and preservation device to stabilize cfRNA and other analytes, enabling us and others to efficiently collect high-quality clinical saliva samples. Using RT-qPCR assays and RNA isotype profiles, we will characterize salivary cfRNA integrity and stability over timelines sufficient for remote collection and transport. Armed with well-characterized RNA decay profiles, we propose an iterative design-of-experiment approach to prototype a versatile device to collect and preserve saliva at room temperature (RT), stabilizing RNA while also preventing cell lysis and bacterial growth. Our device performance validation will use prospectively collected and preserved saliva from >50 women to demonstrate stability for up 72 hours at ambient conditions. This device will standardize methods for collection, stability, and transport of saliva, key to driving virtualized sample collection and healthcare in cancer, viral, and other diagnostics, increasingly critical to a post-pandemic world.",Adoption;Automobile Driving;Biocide;Biological Assay;Biological Markers;Blood specimen;Breast Cancer Detection;COVID-19;COVID-19 detection;COVID-19 pandemic;Cells;Centrifugation;Characteristics;Childhood;Clinic;Clinic Visits;Clinical;Clinical Research;Collection;Complex;Cytolysis;DNA;Detection;Development;Devices;Diagnosis;Diagnostic;Diagnostic tests;Disadvantaged;Disease;Early Diagnosis;Facility Accesses;Feedback;Fractionation;Freezing;Future;Genomics;Grant;Growth;Health;Healthcare;Home;Hour;Human;Image;Individual;Laboratories;Life;Link;Malignant Neoplasms;Manuals;Measurement;Measures;Medical;Medicine;Membrane;Methods;Microbe;Mixed Cellular Population;Molecular;Monitor;Noise;Nucleic Acids;Office Visits;Participant;Patients;Performance;Phase;Population;Process;Property;Quarantine;RNA;RNA Decay;RNA Degradation;RNA Stability;RNA marker;Reagent;Recovery;Research;Saliva;Salivary;Sampling;Savings;Ships;Site;Small Business Innovation Research Grant;Standardization;Surveillance Program;Systemic disease;Temperature;Testing;TimeLine;Training;Traumatic Brain Injury;Validation;Venous blood sampling;Viral;Virus;Woman;Work;autism spectrum disorder;base;biomarker panel;breast imaging;cancer diagnosis;clinical diagnostics;cost;design;exosome;experimental study;innovation;iterative design;malignant breast neoplasm;microbial;microbiota;microorganism growth;mortality;nasal swab;next generation sequencing;nuclease;oral microbial community;oral microbiome;pandemic disease;participant enrollment;pathogen;point of care;preservation;prevent;programs;prospective;protein metabolite;prototype;saliva sample;salivary assay;salivary cell;sample collection;screening;trait;usability;virtual,Shivani Nautiyal,Karl E Krueger,232400,232400,2021-06-03T12:06:00Z,2021-06-03T12:06:00Z,2023-05-31T12:05:00Z,RFA-CA-20-019,nofo_RFA-CA-20-019,"PRIME GENOMICS, INC.",Mountain View,ca,UNITED STATES,imat,org_state,False
1R33CA105295-01,R33CA105295,6726573,2004,Ovarian Cancer Screening Using Comprehensive Proteomics,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The development of biomarkers for earlier detection of ovarian cancer will greatly improve survival. Most women present with advanced stage disease with survival rates of roughly 20%. Advances in the field of proteomics now provide the tools necessary to effectively analyze the serum proteome, and the application of such technologies holds great promise for determining novel biomarkers. This proposal outlines methods to comprehensively discover, identify, quantify, and validate a panel of specific and sensitive ovarian cancer biomarkers for early detection. We propose the following Specific Aims: 1. Determine candidate ovarian cancer biomarkers defined by comprehensive biomarker analysis of serum. Emphasis will be placed on refining the most effective overall analytical strategy for comprehensive and reproducible measurements. Spectral peaks that most accurately distinguish cancer vs. control will be identified using high-resolving power technology. Biostatistics and bioinformatics will be used to prioritize candidate markers (according to specificity, sensitivity and predictive value) for further characterization. 2. Identification and absolute quantification of the candidate biomarkers. This will improve reliability and high-throughput capabilities in subsequent validation testing, and the identification of these proteins will contribute further to research into the biologic basis of the disease. We will use accurate mass measurements, tandem mass spectrometry, and non-redundant protein and genome databases applied to distinct selected controls. Furthermore, we will determine the range of values for both normal and cancer serum samples using stable isotope labeled internal standards. 3. Clinical validation of a panel of biomarkers in specific groups of women. Sera from defined cohorts of women will be used to accurately determine the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of individual and combinations of candidate markers in all aspects of disease (early/late stage, familial, remission and recurrence) and in large numbers of non-cancer controls.",biomarker;clinical research;early diagnosis;female;high throughput technology;human middle age (35-64);human old age (65+);human subject;interview;mass spectrometry;menopause;neoplasm /cancer classification /staging;neoplasm /cancer diagnosis;neoplasm /cancer epidemiology;neoplasm /cancer relapse /recurrence;ovary neoplasms;protein quantitation /detection;proteomics;serum;stable isotope;women&apos;s health,David C.

1R33CA206922-01,R33CA206922,9147682,2016,Online Raman Diagnostics of Oncometabolites,"Project Abstract Cancer cells utilize normal metabolic processes out of context to promote tumor survival. For example, Otto Warburg and others discovered that tumors have increased glucose uptake, glycolysis, and lactate production, often with a reduction in citric acid cycle. While “aerobic glycolysis” at first glance is energetically expensive for tumor cells because it circumvents high ATP production from the citric acid cycle, it allows cancer cells to survive under low nutrient or low oxygen conditions and to instead use glycolytic intermediates for the synthesis of essential cellular building blocks without further energy investment. This change in metabolite regulation suggests a powerful method for monitoring and diagnosing cancer. This project seeks to develop surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) as online detection method for the characterization of metabolites from breast cancer tumor models. Using the SERS results from tumor lysates, diagnostic algorithms will be constructed to improve treatment for cancer. Results show that fluid dynamics can be used to increase the reproducibility and sensitivity of SERS detection in flowing liquids. We propose to develop methodology to enable the use this innovation to investigate metabolites in cancer cell lysates using capillary electrophoresis coupled to a SERS flow detector. We will investigate known metabolites that have been linked to cancer, as well as examine key metabolites associated with oncogenes. The SERS data collected will be used to formulate diagnostic algorithms that can provide a yes/no indicator of cancer. The specific aims of this project are as follows: · AIM 1. Demonstrate the utility of the novel flow detector to assess changes in key metabolites from tumor cell lysates. The tumor cell lysates will be compared with non-cancerous cell lysates to identify trends in these metabolites relevant to breast cancer. · AIM 2. Compare the identification and quantification capabilities with the current gold standard, LC- MS. This aim will assess how SERS characterization both compares with existing technology but also increases coverage of the metabolome. · AIM 3. We will use the metabolites to develop statistical machine learning algorithms to predict the sample label (cancer or not). The predictor obtained will be used as a diagnostic tool of cancer. The development of new technologies that provide unique chemical specific information will enable improved diagnostic assays for the treatment of cancer.",Algorithms;Biological Assay;Biological Markers;Capillary Electrophoresis;Cells;Chemical Structure;Chemicals;Chromatography;Citric Acid Cycle;Comb animal structure;Complex;Coupled;Data;Detection;Development;Developmental Process;Diagnosis;Diagnostic;Disease;Exhibits;Explosion;Fingerprint;Gases;Gene Expression;Gene Proteins;Glycolysis;Goals;Gold;Investigation;Investments;Isomerism;Label;Laboratories;Link;Liquid substance;Machine Learning;Malignant Neoplasms;Mass Spectrum Analysis;Metabolic;Metabolism;Methodology;Methods;Modeling;Monitor;Normal Cell;Nuclear Magnetic Resonance;Nutrient;Oncogenes;Oxygen;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Play;Production;Prognostic Marker;Public Health;Raman Spectrum Analysis;Regulation;Reproducibility;Research;Resistance development;Resolution;Sampling;Surface;Techniques;Technology;Time;abstracting;aerobic glycolysis;base;cancer biomarkers;cancer cell;cancer diagnosis;cancer therapy;chemical property;clinically relevant;cost;detector;diagnostic assay;effective therapy;glucose uptake;improved;innovation;malignant breast neoplasm;mass spectrometer;metabolome;metabolomics;neoplastic cell;new technology;novel;novel diagnostics;patient subsets;personalized medicine;prognostic;protein profiling;success;therapeutic target;therapy resistant;tool;treatment strategy;trend;tumor;tumor metabolism;tumor progression,Zachary Schultz,Brian S Sorg,363875,363875,2016-07-21T12:07:00Z,2016-08-01T12:08:00Z,2019-07-31T12:07:00Z,RFA-CA-15-003,nofo_RFA-CA-15-003,UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME,NOTRE DAME,in,UNITED STATES,imat,org_state,False
1R33CA225539-01,R33CA225539,9492281,2018,An integrated therapeutic T cell receptor screening platform for adoptive cell therapy in cancer,"Abstract Recent successes of T cell receptor based adoptive cell transfer therapy have generated new excitement about this therapeutic approach. However, lacking a high-throughput method of screening of naturally occurring high- affinity therapeutic T cell receptors (TCRs) has put a limit on how widely this approach can be applied to different kinds of cancers and a large range of patients. In this study, we propose to develop an integrated platform that on one hand drastically speeds up the identification and test of therapeutic TCRs and on the other hand, profiles common cancer antigens and HLAs expressed in tumor sample at single cell level.

1R33CA235326-01,R33CA235326,9658219,2019,A Single Conical Tube Device for Precision CAR-T Cells Manufacturing,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Chimeric-antigen-receptor T cells (CAR T cells) have achieved extraordinary success in treating B cell malignancies and have demonstrated high potential for treating solid tumors. However, their widespread use is limited by a number of difficulties in manufacturing such cells. Current manufacturing processes are complicated, costly, and can only produce cells for small populations. Additionally, they have large production variations. As a result, different patients receive very different products or treatments. The long-term goal is to develop a novel technology to address the CAR T manufacturing challenge. Toward this goal, the team has developed a proof- of-concept technology termed stress-free intra-tubular cell culture technology (SFIT). SFIT provides cells uniform, highly reproducible, controllable, and cell-friendly microenvironments, resulting in extremely high culture efficiency and consistency. SFIT produces cells for each patient with one small conical tube, significantly reducing production cost and increasing production capability. The purpose of this project is to further develop and validate this technology and the associated methods to make it ready for the final translational challenge. Leveraging sound preliminary studies and a diverse team of experts, the specific aims are to (1) validate SFIT for culturing T cells from a wide range of donors and for culturing various T cell subtypes, (2) further develop and validate methods for transducing T cells with lentivirus and γ-retrovirus in SFIT, and (3) further develop and validate the SFIT-based single-conical-tube-device for producing autologous CAR T cells. The project will build on the team’s strong preliminary work and include mathematical modeling, prototype device design, extensive T cell culturing, exome-Seq and RNA-Seq data analyses, in vivo testing, statistical analyses and comparisons, and partnership with ADS BIOTEC, a company that designs, builds, and sells instruments for processing human cells. With the completion of this project, simple, disposable, affordable devices for the scalable, cost-effective and consistent production of autologous CAR T cells are expected. This technology can also be scaled up for producing allogeneic CAR T cells in large scales if needed. This technology will not only make CAR T cells broadly accessible, but also make the product much more consistent and predictable. Based on 2012-2014 data, approximately 38.5% of the human population will be diagnosed with some type of cancer during their lifetime. Currently, only about 67% of cancer patients will survive five years after diagnosis. CAR T cell therapy is expected to significantly increase their chances of survival. The technology developed in this proposal will make CAR T cells available to many patients.",3-Dimensional;Address;Adopted;Alginates;Allogenic;Autologous;B lymphoid malignancy;CAR T cell therapy;Caliber;Cancer Patient;Cell Aggregation;Cell Culture Techniques;Cell Death;Cells;Clinical Research;Cultured Cells;Data;Data Analyses;Development;Device Designs;Devices;Diagnosis;Diffusion;Dimensions;Disease;Dose;Ensure;Environmental Risk Factor;Gammaretrovirus;Genetic;Genetic Engineering;Geometry;Goals;Human;Hydrogels;Malignant Neoplasms;Methods;Outcome;Patients;Population;Process;Production;Protocols documentation;Quality of life;Radial;Reproducibility;Solid Neoplasm;Statistical Data Interpretation;Stress;Subfamily lentivirinae;Suspension Culture;T-Lymphocyte;Technology;Time;Translations;Treatment Cost;Tube;Tubular formation;Variant;Virus;Work;base;cancer therapy;cancer type;cell growth;chimeric antigen receptor;chimeric antigen receptor T cells;clinically relevant;cost;cost effective;design;exome sequencing;improved;in vivo;in vivo evaluation;instrument;manufacturing process;mathematical model;new technology;novel;operation;preclinical study;prototype;scale up;shear stress;sound;success;therapy development;transcriptome sequencing;transduction efficiency;tumor,Yuguo Lei,Lokesh Agrawal,353619,353619,2019-03-19T12:03:00Z,2019-03-19T12:03:00Z,2022-02-28T12:02:00Z,RFA-CA-18-005,nofo_RFA-CA-18-005,UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA LINCOLN,LINCOLN,ne,UNITED STATES,imat,org_state,False
4R33CA083232-03,R33CA083232,6739927,2003,APTAMER BASED DETECTOR TO QUANTIFY MACROMOLECULES,"DESCRIPTION: (Applicant's Description) We propose to develop a technology to simultaneously detect and quantify large numbers individual proteins and post-translationally modified proteins. This technology will be based on a spatially-arrayed aptamer microchip and sensitive fluorescence-based optical detection techniques. The system will provide a powerful new tool for biomedical research and diagnosis of diseases and cancers. Currently, the levels of cellular proteins are inferred from cellular mRNA levels by using DNA oligonucleotide microchips. These microchips allow the detection of mRNA levels by base-pairing interactions to homologous DNA oligomers located at different sites in the microchip array. However, this indirect assay of protein levels suffers from two problems: First, mRNA levels may not accurately reflect the level of encoded protein because translation and degradation rates vary from protein to protein and are regulated in response to cell physiology. Second, post-translational modifications proteins often alter critical protein activities. This technology we propose to develop is comprised of three parts: 1) Aptamers with high-affinity and high-specifity for individual proteins. These aptamers will be designed to have ligand-dependent changes in fluorescence properties. 2) A microchip array with each array site occupied by aptamers against a different target molecule. 3) An evanescent field fluorescence detector which detects target molecules binding to aptamers at the array sites. Our proposal includes plans for: 1) selection of aptamers that can discriminate between different post-translational modifications of the same protein; 2) development of fluorescence-based techniques for detecting oligonucleotide:protein interactions; 3) design and construction of an optimized fluorescence detector; 4) scaling up methods to allow large numbers of independent aptamer selections against different proteins; 5) construction of a prototype protein chip.",macromolecule; messenger RNA; microprocessor /microchip; oligonucleotides; posttranslational modifications; proteins; technology /technique development,Andrew D Ellington,John R Knowlton,93033,93033,,2003-06-01T12:06:00Z,2004-05-31T12:05:00Z,PAR-99-100,nofo_PAR-99-100,ARCHEMIX CORPORATION,CAMBRIDGE,ma,UNITED STATES,imat,org_state,False
4R33CA088343-03,R33CA088343,6573328,2002,FLUORESCENT TAGS TARGETED ON CELL SURFACE CARBOHYDRATES,"Malignant transformation is often associated with alteration of cell surface carbohydrates. The expression or over-expression of certain carbohydrates, such as sialyl Lewis X (sLex), sialyl Lewis a (sLea), Lewis X (Lex) and Lewis Y (Ley), has been correlated with the development of certain cancers. These cell surface carbohydrates can be used for cell-specific identification and targeting of carcinoma cells. The long-term goal of this project is the development of small molecule artificial receptors which can recognize target carbohydrate structures with high selectivity and affinity. Such receptors could be used for the development of fluorescent tags for cell- specific identification, tissue-specific imaging (such as MRI), and targeted delivery of therapeutic agents. In this study, we will use sLex as the model carbohydrate and use colon cancer as the model biological system because the expression of sLex is often associated with progression and metastasis of colon cancer. The short-term objective of this application is to develop tissue-specific fluorescent tags (sensors) which can recognize sLex with high affinity and selectivity. For the construction of such fluorescent sensors, we plan to use an integrated approach combining template-directed synthesis, combinatorial chemistry, and computer molecular modeling aided design. The sLex-specific artificial receptors have the potential to be used for cell identification, detection and tagging for the purpose of localization, staging, tissue biopsy, and fluorescence-directed surgical removal of colon cancer cells. Such tissue-specific compounds could also serve as vehicles for targeted delivery of cancer chemotherapeutic agents. These small molecule sensors may also have the following advantages over antibody-based detection/delivery systems: (1) greater stability during storage and in vivo; (2) increased permeability through biological membranes and, therefore, enhanced target accessibility; (3) intrinsic sensitivity to binding with significant fluorescence intensity increases, making detection and visualization easier and more suitable for high throughout screening, and (4) lower propensity to elicit undesirable immune responses. Similar methods, once developed, could also be used for the construction of fluorescent tags for other cell surface carbohydrates implicated in human malignancies.",carbohydrates; chemical models; colon neoplasms; combinatorial chemistry; computer simulation; drug design /synthesis /production; fluorescent dye /probe; surface antigens; tissue /cell culture,Binghe Wang,Daniel L.

4R33CA092752-02,R33CA092752,7249869,2006,Fast Mutation Detection by Tandem SSCP/HA on Microchips,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is proposed to optimize, evaluate, and pilot rapid, scalable, and low-cost microchip electrophoresis technologies for sensitive and specific molecular detection of cancer by tandem single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP)/heteroduplex analysis (HA), using the p53 gene as a model system. We request a 1-year R21 phase and a 3-year R33 phase. The proposed project involves collaboration between members of Northwestern's Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center, including researchers in Chemical Engineering, the Medical School, and Evanston Hospital. Microchannel ""tandem"" SSCP/HA is a novel mutation detection method recently developed in our laboratory, which involves the simultaneous generation and analysis of homo/heteroduplex DNA and SSCP conformers. Studies of a significant number of samples (32) indicate that tandem SSCP/HA allows for much higher-sensitivity mutation detection (100%) than SSCP alone (93%) or HA alone (75%), for p53 samples. We have developed and published optimized sample preparation protocols, gel formulations, and analysis conditions for capillary array electrophoresis (CAE). During the R21 phase, we will translate these methods to microfluidic electrophoresis chips, which offer a large increase in throughput and drop in cost of DNA analysis compared to CAE. The p53 gene, known to be mutated in >50% of human cancers, and whose mutation status can be predictive of patient response to chemotherapy, is the important model system chosen. However, microchip-based genetic analysis technologies to be developed should be easily applied to ANY cancer-related gene. In the R21 phase, we will analyze approximately 60 different DNA samples derived from tumor cell lines, representing a range of mutations in different p53 exons, to determine the impact of DNA sample characteristics and electrophoresis protocols on the sensitivity and specificity of the method, in a blinded study designed by collaborating biostatisticians. When optimized tandem SSCP/HA protocols have been developed for microchips, they will be piloted by the analysis of >200 selected samples amplified from frozen, solid tumors banked at Evanston Hospital. Via this blinded study, sensitivity and specificity (both expected to be at or near 100%) will be determined and reported for the first time using banked tumor tissue, providing necessary validation for clinical application of this technique, and making rapid, low-cost cancer genotyping technology widely available to physicians.",DNA;capillary electrophoresis;clinical research;cooperative study;diagnosis design /evaluation;diagnosis quality /standard;gene mutation;genotype;high throughput technology;immunocytochemistry;neoplasm /cancer diagnosis;nucleic acid quantitation /detection;nucleic acid sequence;p53 gene /protein;polymerase chain reaction;rapid diagnosis;single strand conformation polymorphism;statistics /biometry,Annelise Emily Barron,Avraham Rasooly,235917,235917,2006-07-25T12:07:00Z,2003-09-12T12:09:00Z,2009-05-31T12:05:00Z,PAR-01-106,nofo_PAR-01-106,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,EVANSTON,il,UNITED STATES,imat,org_state,False
4R33CA105514-02,R33CA105514,7085601,2005,Assaying Tyrosine Kinase Activity: A New Paradigm,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): New approaches are needed in the molecular analyses of the growth-promoting signal transduction pathways involved in the development and maintenance of cancer. The Laser Micropipet System (LMS), a new technology for the biochemical assay of kinases, holds the promise of directly assaying the activities of protein tyrosine kinases in primary patient cells. The LMS was developed for the assay of serine/threonine kinases in individual cells grown in tissue culture. This R21/R33 application proposes to expand the applications of this instrumentation to directly determine the activity of oncogenic tyrosine kinases in primary cells from patients. Assay of Bcr-Abl in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) will demonstrate the power of this tool for research, clinical, and pharmacologic applications. While this assay will be of value in the study of the biology and resistance mechanisms in CML, the studies will lay the groundwork for a new paradigm in the study of molecular mechanisms in cancer signal transduction and will have general applicability. The R21 phase of this proposal is designed to establish the feasibility of assaying Bcr-Abl activity and to demonstrate the necessary assay conditions for measurements in cells derived from a patient with CML. The specific aims are to: 1) identify and characterize a reporter of intracellular Bcr-Ab1 kinase activity, 2) define and optimize conditions for measuring Bcr-Ab1 activity in human cells, 3) compare reporter phosphorylation in cells expressing Bcr-Ab1 vs. cells lacking this kinase, and 4) demonstrate the feasibility of using primary patient cells in kinase assays. The goal of the R33 phase is to demonstrate the potential for the LMS-based kinase assay in applications for the study of the biology of pharmacologic resistance in CML, including from primary patient cells. The R33 specific aims are to: 1) develop a membrane-permeant Bcr-Ab1 kinase reporter, 2) demonstrate the ability to detect imatinib resistance in CML cell lines, 3) determine Bcr-Ab1 activity in primary cells from patients with CML and their response to pharmacologic inhibition, and 4) determine if the assay can detect the emergence of imatinib resistance in CML patients and can differentiate the mechanisms of drug resistance.",biological signal transduction;capillary electrophoresis;carcinogenesis;cell growth regulation;chronic myelogenous leukemia;clinical research;enzyme activity;enzyme mechanism;gene expression;human subject;intracellular;neoplastic cell;oncoproteins;phosphorylation;protein purification;protein tyrosine kinase;reporter genes;single cell analysis;technology /technique development,Christopher E Sims,Min-Kyung H Song,481662,481662,2005-08-08T12:08:00Z,2005-08-08T12:08:00Z,2008-07-31T12:07:00Z,PAR-01-106,nofo_PAR-01-106,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,IRVINE,ca,UNITED STATES,imat,org_state,False
4R33CA107943-02,R33CA107943,7194502,2006,A Novel Proteomics Technology for Protein Farnesylation,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The identification and characterization of changes in the level of farnesylated proteins in response to the treatment of farnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTIs), a newly introduced family of antitumor agents currently undergoing clinical evaluation, represents a major scientific challenge. Extant proteomics methods are limited to quantifying a few thousands of the most abundant proteins and, therefore, are unsuitable for the targeted profiling of less abundant farnesylated expression. The major goal of this application is to develop and validate a powerful technology, Tagging via Azido Substrate (TAS), for the efficient isolation of farnesylated proteins. This technology will then be applied to the proteomics analysis of farnesylated proteins in physiologically relevant models. The TAS technology involves the introduction of a synthetic azide-modified farnesyl substrate, either farnesyl azide diphosphate (FPP-azide) or farnesyl azide alcohol (F-azide-OH), which replaces the natural substrate during cellular protein farnesylation. The resulting farnesyl-azide (F-azide)-modified proteins will be affinity-purified through an azide-specific conjugation reaction (Staudinger reaction) using a phosphine capture reagent linked to photo-cleavable beads, which can then be released by UV light-induced photo-cleavage. Since affinity purification relies on covalent bonding resulting from a specific conjugation reaction between an azide and phosphine capture reagent, other proteins without the F-azide modification can be effectively removed by thorough washing. Thus, the TAS technology will allow farnesylated proteins to be isolated with high yield, high specificity, and low contamination. The initial focus of the R21 portion of this proposal is on the development of TAS technology and its application to the isolation of farnesylated proteins. These studies will be extended subsequently to geranylgeranylated proteins. The R33 proposal will aim at applications of the TAS technology to the identification of novel FTI targets. These studies will provide fundamental information for the understanding of molecular mechanisms of FTI functions and are likely to identify novel targets for antitumor drug design.",,Yingming Zhao,John R Knowlton,506055,506055,2006-04-07T12:04:00Z,2004-06-07T12:06:00Z,2009-03-31T12:03:00Z,PAR-01-104,nofo_PAR-01-104,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,DALLAS,tx,UNITED STATES,imat,org_state,False
4R33CA114149-02,R33CA114149,7281787,2006,Imaging tumor associated fibroblast activation protein,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this research is to develop a novel fibroblast activation protein (FAP) sensing near infrared fluorescence reporter for early tumor detection and tumor classification. FAP is a cell surface antigen of reactive tumor stromal fibroblasts founded in more than 90% of epithelial carcinomas, but it is absent from epithelial carcinoma cells, normal fibroblasts, and other normal human tissue. Supporting tumor stromal fibroblasts are generally localized close to tumor vasculature, which is essential for early tumor development and growth. Thus it has been chosen as a target for monoclonal antibody based tumor therapy. FAP is not only a membrane protein but also a dipeptidyl peptidase. An imaging probe to report enzymatic activity and location of FAP could be extremely useful for early tumor detection. In this application we will develop a small molecular probe with ultra-sensitivity based on a unique class of fluorogenic chromophore that has significant changes in emission at different chemical states. Specifically, the probes emit no fluorescence in their initial intact state but become brightly fluorescent after specific proteolytic reaction. The newly developed low molecular weight, well defined fluorogenic probes are expected to have several advantages for imaging: a) fast tissue distribution allowing earlier imaging after injection, b) fast clearance allowing repeated imaging, and c) high likelihood of developing key candidates into clinically useful agents. The choice of FAP is based on its importance in tumor growth, invasion, and other processes in oncogenesis. Together with recent developments in fluorescence imaging technologies, this research is expected to ultimately result in clinical imaging agents with specificity for targeted enzymes. We believe that the developed approach can be used as a platform to design a broad spectrum of activatable molecular probes to image other amino peptidases in vivo.",aminopeptidase;athymic mouse;bioimaging /biomedical imaging;chemical synthesis;colon neoplasms;enzyme activity;enzyme induction /repression;fibroblasts;fluorescent dye /probe;ionophores;molecular /cellular imaging;molecular probes;neoplasm /cancer diagnosis;neoplasm /cancer transplantation;peptidyl dipeptidase;technology /technique development,Ching-Hsuan Tung,James W.

The assay proposed relies on an electro catalytic process involving two transition-metal ions that reports on biomolecular complexation events. Because the reporter system responds to changes in the electrostatics of an electrode surface, it will enable the analysis of nucleic acids/protein and peptide/protein complexes. The proposed project has 3 specific aims: 1) electro catalytic detection of DNA repair proteins implicated in cancer using DNA-modified electrodes; 2) optimization of electro catalytic detection and multiplexed analysis of cellular DNA repair activities, and 3) development of a generalized electro catalytic protein detection method using prostate cancer biomarkers. The electro catalytic protein detection system described is advantageous because it will allow the analysis and discrimination of multiprotein complexes in addition to uncomplexed analytes and will have high selectivity and specificity. Additionally, the protein detection assays will be conducted using nanoelectrodes that will allow multiplexed detection of panels of different biomolecular targets.",DNA binding protein;DNA repair;biomarker;biotechnology;carbonates;electrochemistry;electrodes;high throughput technology;nanotechnology;oligonucleotides;prostate neoplasms;prostate specific antigen;protein quantitation /detection;synthetic nucleotide;technology /technique development,Shana O Kelley,John R Knowlton,45407,45407,2006-08-29T12:08:00Z,2005-06-21T12:06:00Z,2006-12-15T12:12:00Z,RFA-CA-05-002,nofo_RFA-CA-05-002,BOSTON COLLEGE,CHESTNUT HILL,ma,UNITED STATES,imat,org_state,False
5R21CA114852-02,R21CA114852,7077713,2006,Profile serum proteins by glycopeptide capture and LC-MS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancers develop over a period of several years and they are characterized by molecular changes prior to invasion and metastasis. Development of a technology that enables screening of cancer from body fluids could permit cancer detection at early and treatable stages. It is expected that the composition of the serum proteome contains valuable information about the state of the human body in health and disease, and that this information can be extracted via quantitative proteomic measurements. Suitable proteomic techniques need to be sensitive, reproducible and robust, to detect potential biomarkers below the level of highly expressed proteins, to generate data sets that are comparable between experiments and laboratories, and have high throughput to support studies with sufficient statistical power. In this proposal, we will develop a method for high throughput quantitative analysis of serum proteins. It consists of the selective isolation of the peptides that are N-linked glycosylated in the intact protein using solid-phase extraction of glycopeptides (SPEG) on a robotic workstation, the analysis of these now de-glycosylated peptides by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS), and the comparative analysis of the resulting patterns. By focusing selectively on a few formerly N-linked glycopeptides per serum protein, the complexity of the analyte sample is significantly reduced, and the sensitivity, reproducibility, and throughput of serum proteome analysis are increased compared with the analysis of total tryptic peptides from unfractionated samples. We will explore the feasibility to identify cancer-specific serum proteins in the background of normal variation using a carcinogen-induced skin cancer mouse model. The specific aims are: 1) To develop chemistries and protocols for an automatic robotic system to isolate N-linked glycopeptides from serum in a high throughput and highly reproducible fashion; 2) To develop efficient and reproducible procedures for LC-MS analyses, and sequence identification of discriminatory peptides by tandem mass spectrometry; 3) To explore the feasibility of this method for the identification of distinctive serum peptides specific to cancer-bearing mice in the background of normal variations. If successful, the proposed research could subsequently be used for profiling human serum samples from cancer patients and normal individuals to identify the cancer-associated proteins in serum. The identified biomarkers will open a new paradigm for performing screening and detection of human cancer at early stage and for clinical therapeutic management.",biomarker;biomedical automation;biotechnology;blood proteins;glycopeptides;high throughput technology;laboratory mouse;liquid chromatography mass spectrometry;neoplasm /cancer diagnosis;proteomics;technology /technique development,Hui Zhang,John R Knowlton,50219,50219,2006-06-01T12:06:00Z,2005-06-13T12:06:00Z,2006-11-30T12:11:00Z,RFA-CA-05-002,nofo_RFA-CA-05-002,INSTITUTE FOR SYSTEMS BIOLOGY,SEATTLE,wa,UNITED STATES,imat,org_state,False

A plethora of methods have been developed for genetic dissection of biological processes in somatic cells in culture; however, the adaptation of these techniques to in vivo use has been very limited. Our earlier experience indicates that reversible promoter-insertion mutagenesis offers a number of advantages over the currently used forward genetics techniques for cultured cells. The most important benefits are the dominant nature of the mutations, and the ease of identifying the affected gene and establishing the causal link between the mutation and the phenotype. The principal limitation for the adaptation of this technique to in vivo studies is the delivery of the insertional mutagen (typically, a retroviral vector) to the desired cell type. Based on our recent experience and published data from others, we propose a method to circumvent this limitation via the use of specially engineered transposon vectors. We propose to apply our technique to study the genetic events underlying melanoma development. We will screen for genetic events that cooperate with oncogenic Ras (commonly found in melanomas) in this process. We will confirm the properties of the proposed insertional mutagens in culture and then proceed to establish mouse strains suitable for mutagenesis. Upon verifying the properties of our constructs in vivo, we will selectively mutagenize melanocytes in transgenic animals and will test the functional link between tumorigenesis and the inserted promoter. Confirmed hits will be the subject of future investigation, while the technique itself will become available for dissection of various biological phenomena in general and aspects of tumorigenesis, in particular.",biomarker;biotechnology;cell line;gene mutation;genetically modified animals;guanine nucleotide binding protein;laboratory mouse;melanocyte;melanoma;neoplasm /cancer genetics;oncogenes;technology /technique development;tetracyclines;tissue /cell culture;transfection /expression vector;transposon /insertion element,Eugene S Kandel,Jennifer A.

This information has provided useful information with regard to molecular mechanisms that define the enhanced survival and proliferation of MM cells. However, an equally, if not more important, goal is to define those proteins that participate in signaling pathways active in MM cells and their supporting stroma. Enzymes that phosphorylate tyrosine, serins and threonine residues on other proteins play a major role in signaling cascades that determine cell cycle entry and survival in MM and the stromal cells that support them. In particular, knowing the signaling pathways that are active in MM cells and their supporting stroma will provide critical information for understanding MM cell survival in the BM. We have developed and are applying to purified cells a novel array-based strategy that allows the simultaneous detection of phosphorylation for 1152 different kinase substrates. Here we propose to apply this emerging technology to the analysis of phosphorylation-based cell signaling pathways in MM and their supporting stroma. This R21/R33 Phased Innovation application will be pursued in two phases. In the R21 phase of this application Aims 1 and 2 will validate that PepChip technology can be applied to MM cells and their microenvironment to reveal signaling alterations in MM. In Aim 3 of the R33 phase we will use PepChip technology to identify kinome alterations within the MM patient population that are correlated with clinical parameters such as relapse and chromosomal abnormalities associated with poor prognosis.

In partnership with alterations in histone acetylation/methylation, this epigenetic event establishes a repressive chromatin structure that leads to silencing of key cancer-related genes. The occurrence of DNA methylation within the genome is not random, but rather patterns of methylation are generated that are gene and tumor type specific. How DNA methylation patterns are established is still poorly understood. Since various transcriptional factors or regulators are found in association with DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) in vivo, we hypothesize that: 1) Oncogenic transcription factors can recruit DNMTs to target gene promoters and define a unique epigenetic signature in tumor cells; 2) Dissecting such complex epigenetic hierarchy will identify novel molecular targets for diagnosis, prognosis and therapeutic intervention. To test our hypothesis, we developed a high throughput technique for genome wide analysis of DNA methylation associated with specific proteins such as histones, transcription factors or any DNA binding proteins. The new approach named ChlP-Chop-DMH will combine both genome wide location analysis (also known as ChlP-on-Chip) and Differential Methylation Hybridization (DMH) analysis, two emerging technologies used in epigenetic research. The proposed method has distinct advantages over current protocols: first, this method directly examines the in vivo interaction of specific proteins with methylated DNA throughout the genome; second, this method may uncover novel biological properties of transcription factors; third, this method can be applied to discover novel epigenetic biomarkers relevant to tumorigenesis. In preliminary studies, we have verified the utility of this method with methylated histone H3 at lysine 9 and lysine 4 in human cancer cells. In the R21 phase, we will continue minor refinement of the method and pursue three aims: 1) Improve and optimize the ChlP-Chop-DMH method for analyzing genome wide association of DNA methylation with histone modification; 2) Utilize the proposed method to investigate the association of DNA methylation with chromatin remodeling factors: 3) Show proof-of-concept using the array to examine primary non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHLs). In this development phase we will focus on the sensitivity, reproducibility and accuracy of the proposed method. In the R33 phase, our goal is to utilize the technology to test biological hypotheses. We will fully implement the method and pursue these aims: 1) Discover epigenetic target genes associated with known oncogenic transcription factors c-Myc and BCL6: 2) Validate the identified epigenetic targets and investigate the regulatory role of the associated oncogenic transcription factors. This systematic approach will provide a powerful tool for future mechanistic studies as well as cancer diagnosis.",Algorithms;Antibodies;B-Cell Neoplasm;B-Cell NonHodgkins Lymphoma;B-Lymphocytes;BCL6 gene;Binding;Bioinformatics;Biological;Biological Assay;Biological Markers;Biological Testing;Cell Line;Cells;Chromatin Remodeling Factor;Chromatin Structure;Classification;Clinical;Cobra;Complex;CpG Islands;DNA;DNA Methylation;DNA Methyltransferase;DNA Modification Methylases;DNA-Binding Proteins;Development;Diagnosis;EZH2 gene;Emerging Technologies;Epigenetic Process;Event;Future;Gene Targeting;Genes;Genome;Goals;Histone Acetylation;Histone H3;Histones;Human;Hypermethylation;Location;Luciferases;Lymphoma;Lymphomagenesis;Lysine;Malignant Neoplasms;Measures;Methods;Methyl-CpG-Binding Protein 2;Methylation;Minor;Modeling;Modification;Molecular Target;Names;Non-Hodgkin&apos;s Lymphoma;Oncogene Proteins;Oncogenic;Pattern;Phase;Play;Polymerase Chain Reaction;Property;Proteins;Protocols documentation;Recruitment Activity;Reporter;Reproducibility;Research;Research Personnel;Role;Sampling;Small Interfering RNA;Standards of Weights and Measures;Techniques;Technology;Testing;Therapeutic Intervention;Validation;c-myc Genes;cancer cell;cancer diagnosis;concept;genome wide association study;genome-wide analysis;improved;in vivo;neoplastic cell;novel;novel strategies;outcome forecast;programs;promoter;tool;transcription factor;tumor;tumorigenesis;vector,Huidong Shi,Jerry Li,151532,151532,2007-08-10T12:08:00Z,2006-09-26T12:09:00Z,2008-12-31T12:12:00Z,RFA-CA-06-003,nofo_RFA-CA-06-003,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,COLUMBIA,mo,UNITED STATES,imat,org_state,False
5R21CA125398-02,R21CA125398,7493071,2008,The Kinomes of Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gene profiling technology has enabled analysis of the transcriptome and proteome of tumor cells. In fact, massively parallel analysis of the Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) transcriptome has revealed discrete gene profile signatures for the major subtypes of NHL, diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and follicular lymphoma (FL). This information has provided useful insights into molecular mechanisms that promote enhanced survival and proliferation in NHL. However, an equally, if not more important goal, is to define those proteins that participate in signaling pathways active in lymphoma cells and non-malignant cells that infiltrate these tumors. Enzymes that phosphorylate tyrosine, serine and threonine residues on other proteins play a major role in signaling cascades that control cell cycle entry, survival, angiogenesis and the immune response. Defining how these signaling pathways are altered in NHL B cells and non- malignant cells present in these tumors will provide critical information for understanding how lymphoma survives, proliferates and interacts with other cells at the tumor site. We are applying to purified tumor cells a novel array strategy that allows the simultaneous detection of phosphorylation for 1152 different kinase substrates. Here we propose to apply this emerging technology to the analysis of phosphorylation-based cell signaling pathways in NHL. This proposal will be pursued in two phases. The R21 phase will consist of two aims that will validate PepChip technology can identify kinome alterations in primary DLBCL (Aim 1) and FL (Aim 2) isolates. The R33 phase will consist of two aims that will define kinome alterations in DLBCL (Aim 3) and FL (Aim 4) that correlate with clinical parameters. In Aim 5 we will utilize in vivo models of FL and DLBCL to determine whether inhibitors specific for deregulated kinases inhibit growth of NHL tumors in immunodeficient mice. This study will be pursued in the following phased R21/R33 format: R21 Phase: Aim 1: Define the kinome of DLBCL B cells and non-malignant cells present in these tumors. Aim 2: Define the kinome of FL B cells and non-malignant cells present in these tumors. Aim 3: Identify kinome alterations in DLBCL correlated with clinical parameters of disease. R33 Phase: Aim 4: Identify kinome alterations in FL correlated with clinical parameters of disease. Aim 5: Determine whether deregulated kinases contribute to NHL growth in vivo.",B-Cell Lymphomas;B-Cell NonHodgkins Lymphoma;B-Lymphocytes;Cell Cycle Regulation;Cells;Clinical;Detection;Diffuse Lymphoma;Disease;Emerging Technologies;Enzymes;Follicular Lymphoma;Gene Expression Profile;Genes;Goals;Growth;Immune response;Immunodeficient Mouse;Lymphoma;Molecular;Non-Hodgkin&apos;s Lymphoma;Non-Malignant;Phase;Phosphorylation;Phosphotransferases;Play;Proliferating;Proteins;Proteome;Role;Serine;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;Site;Technology;Threonine;Tyrosine;angiogenesis;base;cancer cell;in vivo;in vivo Model;inhibitor/antagonist;insight;large cell Diffuse non-Hodgkin&apos;s lymphoma;neoplastic cell;novel;tumor,William Garrow Kerr,Avraham Rasooly,132379,132379,2008-07-28T12:07:00Z,2007-09-01T12:09:00Z,2009-03-31T12:03:00Z,RFA-CA-07-019,nofo_RFA-CA-07-019,H.

5R21CA132806-02,R21CA132806,7609116,2009,Standardized NanoArray PCR for Gene Expression Profiling of Lung Cancer,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Molecular characterization of cancer, in particular by gene transcription profiling, has great potential to improve prognosis, therapeutic selection and clinical outcomes. However, the potential for using expression signatures for cancer prognosis and treatment selection is hampered by lack of readily deployable test kits with the accuracy, low RNA requirement and inter-site concordance required for routine clinical use. We propose an innovative solution based on two well-validated PCR technologies whose combination uniquely addresses the problem of diagnostic assay reproducibility. Our plan is to implement Standardized RT (StaRT)-PCR, a proven competitive PCR method developed at the University of Toledo, in a novel nanofluidic PCR platform developed by BioTrove Inc. in order to streamline the fluidic workflow, improve measurement throughput, and at the same time reduce test cost and maintain low RNA input. As compared to existing hybridization or real-time qPCR approaches, Standardized NanoArray PCR (SNAP) will provide the same dynamic range and quality as RT-PCR, yet require less RNA input and be more readily clinically deployable. The development will entail step-wise integration of proven technologies. First, real-time qPCR TaqMan assays will be developed for 16 lung tumor prognostic genes. These assays will be converted to StaRT-PCR by creation of competitive template and a competitor specific dye-labeled probe. Adding a pre-amplification step to StaRT-PCR will reduce the RNA input requirements to enable thousands of tests per sample. Finally, moving the assays into the OpenArray nano-PCR plate will streamline fluid handling. Using RNA isolated from lung clinical tumor resections, dynamic range and precision equivalent to real-time qPCR will be demonstrated for the integrated platform. After the initial development phase is complete, we will compare SNAP and real time qPCR in two critical gene expression profiling experiments. First we will compare the minimum amount of RNA required for each method by monitoring loss of precision as a function of decreasing RNA sample input. Second we will demonstrate lower inter-site variability, a critical factor for deploy-ability, by measuring gene expression profiles of seven lung tumor resection samples in three laboratories. Meeting these Specific Aims will lead to seeking further funding for multi-site prognostic validation studies involving formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) lung specimens with extensive clinical history.",Address;Adoption;Biological Assay;Cancer Prognosis;Characteristics;Chemistry;Clinical;Color;Consumption;Detection;Development;Diagnostic;Diagnostic Procedure;Diagnostic tests;Dyes;End Point Assay;Excision;Formalin;Freezing;Funding;Gene Expression;Gene Expression Profile;Gene Expression Profiling;Genes;Genetic Transcription;Genomics;Goals;Health;Label;Laboratories;Lead;Liquid substance;Lung;Lung Neoplasms;Malignant Neoplasms;Malignant neoplasm of lung;Measurement;Measures;Methods;Molecular;Molecular Diagnostic Testing;Molecular Profiling;Monitor;Morphologic artifacts;Nanoarray Analytical Device;Operative Surgical Procedures;Outcome;Paraffin Embedding;Performance;Phase;Quality Control;RNA;Recording of previous events;Reproducibility;Running;Sampling;Selection for Treatments;Site;Solutions;Specimen;Speed;Staging;System;Taq Polymerase;Technology;Testing;Therapeutic;Time;Universities;Validation;base;cost;design;flexibility;improved;inhibitor/antagonist;innovation;malignant breast neoplasm;meetings;nano;nanofluidic;neoplastic;novel;nuclease;outcome forecast;prognostic;research study;tumor;validation studies,Tony E Godfrey; Tom B Morrison; James C.

5R21CA138333-03,R21CA138333,8516466,2013,Methods of systematic microRNA target validation and identification,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is well known that microRNAs could play a fundamental role in regulation of diverse cellular functions. As key gene regulators, microRNAs work through a posttranscriptional repression mechanism. Increasing evidence indicates that deregulation of microRNA expression could lead to a variety of disorders including human cancer. Although significant progress has been made in the past years in discovery of microRNAs and their biogenesis, and their role in many cellular phenotypes, it is not fully understood how microRNAs exert their cellular functions because a single microRNA can have hundreds of targets. Hence, identification of microRNA targets is a critical step toward understanding of molecular mechanisms of microRNA-mediated gene expression in normal and disease processes. Currently, this largely relies on computer-aided algorithms, which unfortunately are still unable to provide a precise picture of microRNA regulatory networks, and thus the predicted targets need further experimental validations. It is evident that target validation is a bottle neck in our effort to dissect microRNA pathways. In this application, we propose to develop a novel selection method for microRNA target validation and identification through two complementary approaches. The first approach is to determine microRNA/mRNA interactions using our pre-microRNA collection against a specific target cloned in our selection plasmid; the second approach is to determine microRNA/mRNA interactions using a 3'-UTR (untranslated region) library against a specific microRNA. We believe that our selection method is innovative, simple and powerful. An additional benefit of this method will allow us to determine whether there are any new features, besides the seed sequence homology, which could contribute to the specificity of microRNA targeting. Accordingly, this study will greatly enhance our understanding of microRNA targeting and gene regulation by providing a valuable research tool.",Algorithms;Biogenesis;Cell physiology;Collection;Complementary DNA;Computer Assisted;Databases;Disease;Functional RNA;Gene Expression;Gene Expression Regulation;Gene Targeting;Genes;Human;Lead;Learning;Libraries;Malignant Neoplasms;Mediating;Messenger RNA;Methods;MicroRNAs;Molecular;Neck;Normal Cell;Pathway interactions;Phenotype;Plasmids;Play;Process;Regulation;Regulator Genes;Repression;Research;Role;Science;Seeds;Sequence Homology;Source;Specificity;System;Technology;Testing;Translational Repression;Untranslated Regions;Validation;Work;base;human disease;innovation;mRNA Transcript Degradation;novel;research study;success;tool,Yin-Yuan Mo,Jerry Li,174960,174960,2013-06-25T12:06:00Z,2011-07-01T12:07:00Z,2015-06-30T12:06:00Z,RFA-CA-10-005,nofo_RFA-CA-10-005,UNIVERSITY OF MISSISSIPPI MED CTR,JACKSON,ms,UNITED STATES,imat,org_state,False

The shortest telomere or a small subset of the shortest telomeres in a cell will determine the onset of senescence, apoptosis, or genome instability; single (TTAGGG)n tracts are crucial for the function of telomeres and the biological effects of telomere attrition and dysfunction. Telomere loss, breakage, fusion, and rejoining are highly elevated in cancer, but current methods for detecting and measuring these mutational events at the molecular level are limited and low-throughput. The technology we propose to develop here would permit quantitative, single- allele-resolution measurements of telomere length and instability, enabling unprecedented insights into the role(s) telomere loss, telomere breakage/re-joining, and telomerase or ALT dependent telomere elongation play in carcinogenesis, including mechanistic insights into molecular events mediating these processes and translational insights for the potential prognostic and tumor stratification applicability of the methods.

However, the translation of fundamental epigenomic insight to the clinic is wrought with challenges. Take for example the study of post-translational histone protein modifications, which can serve to either promote or repress the transcription of pendant DNA sequences. Analyses of these critically important interactions bridge genomics and proteomics and present significant challenges in the clinical setting. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) is the method of choice for analyzing protein-DNA interactions and the basic method involves fragmentation of chromatin, separation of modified proteins using antibodies and magnetic beads, and subsequent analysis of the associated DNA by qPCR or sequencing. While sounding simple, a typical ChIP workflow involves ~30 steps, takes 4+ days, and requires 106-107 cells as input. These requirements significantly limit the applicability of ChIP in a clinical setting-particularly when minimal sampl is available, such as in the analysis of tumor biopsies, stem cells, or circulating tumor cells. Microfluidic devices offer many attractive benefits over traditional macro-scale methods including reduced volume requirements, parallelization capability, and automated operation, which make them particularly well- suited to sample-constrained epigenetic analyses. A handful of recent reports suggest a substantial opportunity for microfluidically-enabled ChIP analyses; however, there is still considerable room for further improvement. We propose to develop a powerful and versatile, droplet microfluidics-based, nanoliter-scale Chromatin ImmunoCapture (nChIC) platform suitable for individualized medicine applications. Droplet microfluidics offer several benefits, including rapid, controlled, and efficient fluid handling, and the capacity to handle variable sample sizes, since devices can accommodate larger samples by simply operating for longer periods of time. Our nChIC platform will incorporate every major step in the ChIP workflow into an automated device, including cell lysis, chromatin digestion, immunocapture, and DNA purification. Importantly, these processes will be carried out at the single cell level, which promises to provide unique insights into epigenomic tumor heterogeneity. Beyond single cells, the unprecedented ability to handle samples of variable input will also facilitate robust validation against traditional ChIP assays to demonstrate broad genomic coverage.

Investigators' long-term goal, to be pursued in R33 phase, is to develop T cells into a platform vector technology for active drug- transport to the solid tumors. In this R21 application, their objective is to engineer a robust mechanism to transform autologous T cells into biofactories for autonomous synthesis of cytocidal secretory proteins upon stimulation by the tumor cells. Autonomous synthesis of Protein-of-Interest (PoI) with spatiotemporal resolution will enable targeting of tumor burden with cellular resolution and molecular specificity. Their central hypothesis is that T cells can be genetically encoded for robust modulation and biosynthesis of therapeutic proteins at the tumor site. They have chosen ovarian cancer that expresses Folate Receptor alpha (FRa) as disease model, and an apoptotic protein for its cytotoxic therapeutic value. However, the rationale for developing T cells as protein biofactories is that this is a platform technology and their specificity can be modified to target any cancer and autonomously synthesize any PoI in situ. To aid this R21 effort, they have developed cell lines expressing bioluminescent and fluorescent reporters expressed only when stimulated by tumor cells. With following specific aims, they will advance this project towards its goals: (1) To develop robust control on biosynthesis of protein-of-interest (PoI); (2) To develop T cells as biofactories for autonomous secretion of antitumor apoptotic protein. It is expected that this R21 phase will lead to T cells that will not activate in healthy tissues (enhanced safety) and hyperactivate specifically in the tumor microenvironment (enhanced efficacy). The impact of this research will also be felt on ongoing T-cell therapy trials by reducing the incidences of graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD). This pioneering approach builds upon ongoing T-cell immunotherapy trials, which are currently limited to control minimal residual disease (MRD) and is administered after chemotherapy. Proposed research is transformative, firstly because it will expand the scope of T-cell engineering to replace systemic chemotherapies. This will then be used for reduction of tumor burden rather than keeping MRD in check. Secondly, therapeutic proteins of non-human origin are efficiently degraded and removed by the immune system. This is a barrier to their in vivo application. The use of autologous T cells for biosynthesis of therapeutic proteins at the target site will eliminate any immunogenicity issues.

Recent single cell genetic studies have shown that driver mutations and cancer cell subtype are highly heterogeneous within a single patient. Thus, clinicians will need to employ experimental methods that allow observation of a variety of molecular analytes across many individual cells within a particular patient's tumor section in situ. Current tumor section analyses are not highly multiplexed and typically remain limited to ~4-5 analytes, or 7 with multi-spectral imaging. Recent technologies have pushed this number into 30s-60s, but they require expensive equipment and/or reagents, sophisticated analyses or markedly increased assay time, all of which would preclude their practical use in many clinical pathology and preclinical research laboratories. Thus, there remains a significant need for technologies that multiplex measurements in tumor sections but are widely accessible and cost-effective. We focus on addressing this need with a readily-adoptable but novel multi- spectral fluorescence-based method. It is based on the hypothesis that the power of combinatorics can be harnessed to vastly increase the number of quantifiable analytes in a mixture by permuting the wide array of available fluorophores in new ways. We term our approach combinatorial fluorescence with spectral imaging (CoFSI). CoFSI only requires the ability to perform multi-channel fluorescence excitation and emission spectral scanning, which is widely available and easy to implement in most plate/slide readers and many microscopes. Data analysis involves a straightforward, fast computational technique called linear unmixing. Preliminary simulation studies suggest that the concentrations of 123 different CoFSI probes constructed from 16 existing fluorescent proteins can be estimated simultaneously with good accuracy and precision across 3 orders of concentration magnitude with a large number of excitation channels, and 48 probes with 6 excitation channels. Similar simulation studies constrained by available tumor section imaging equipment and Alexa dyes suggest 25 simultaneous measurements are possible. Initial pilot experiments demonstrate that seven different CoFSI probe levels in a mixture can be measured both accurately and precisely using only the blue-yellow part of the spectrum. This proposal further tests the limits of CoFSI experimentally, and applies CoFSI to tumor section imaging, with two Aims: (1) Quantify the Levels of 48 Fluorescent Probes in a Mixture Simultaneously; and (2) Quantify the Spatial Distribution of 25 Analytes in Tumor Sections. If successful, CoFSI can increase quantitative fluorescence multiplexing at least ~5 to 10-fold while relying on standard lab resources and straightforward analyses.

5R21CA202831-02,R21CA202831,9257339,2017,Novel Bi-functional Inhibitors Blocking OncomiR Biogenesis,"﻿ DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this proposal is to develop a new class of selective miRNA regulators that blocks the maturation of oncomiRs. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate diverse biological processes. Dysregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) has become one of the emerging mechanisms contributes to cancer formation and progression. Increasing evidences suggest that certain miRNAs affect cellular transformation, carcinogenesis and metastasis, and act as oncogenes (oncogenic miRNAs or oncomiRs). Understanding the roles of oncomiRs in cancer will lead to the development of new cancer therapies. Besides, direct therapeutic intervention of oncomiRs has become a promising new direction for treating cancer. For both research and therapeutic purposes, methods allowing the control of oncomiR levels are highly desirable. Current methods for such purposes generally suffer from the off-target inhibition. To address this critical issue, we propose a novel strategy to regulate miRNA. We will develop a new class of bi-functional miRNA regulators consisting of independent and specialized ""pre-miRNA recognition unit"" and ""Dicer inhibition unit"" to target unique pre- miRNAs and block their processing to generate mature miRNAs by inhibiting Dicer enzymatic activity. The following Aims will accomplish our goal of establishing this new strategy: Aim 1. Synthesize and test bi- functional miRNA regulators. We will synthesize bi-functional regulators for miRNA-21 (miR-21) and other oncomiRs and test their inhibitory activity. Aim 2: Test the activity and specificity of the bi-functional miRNA regulator in cells. We will optimize cellular uptake of the regulator in mammalian cells. The cellular activity and off-target effects of the regulator will be evaluated in cells. This work will establish the technical foundation of a novel oncomiR regulation strategy. This unique technology will address the major obstacle encountered in current miRNA regulating methods and enhance the capability to dissect the roles of oncomiRs in cancer biology. It will significantly contribute to the advancement in our knowledge of the role played by oncomiRs in cancer and will result in the development of novel cancer therapies either directly based on the bi- modular regulators or evolved from the understanding of oncomiR functions unveiled by this new technology.",Address;Adverse effects;Affect;Affinity;Antisense Oligonucleotides;Binding;Biogenesis;Biological Assay;Biological Process;Cancer Biology;Cell physiology;Cells;Development;Dicer Enzyme;Foundations;Generations;Goals;In Vitro;Knowledge;Link;Malignant Neoplasms;Mammalian Cell;Messenger RNA;Methods;MicroRNAs;Neoplasm Metastasis;Northern Blotting;Oncogenes;Oncogenic;Pathogenesis;Play;Proteins;Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR;RNA;Regulation;Research;Role;Specificity;Technology;Testing;Therapeutic;Therapeutic Intervention;Untranslated RNA;Western Blotting;Work;base;cancer therapy;cancer type;carcinogenesis;design;improved;inhibitor/antagonist;interest;metaplastic cell transformation;new technology;next generation;novel;novel strategies;novel therapeutics;public health relevance;research and development;ribosome profiling;transcriptome sequencing;uptake,Fu-Sen Liang,John R Knowlton,184599,184599,2017-04-26T12:04:00Z,2016-05-01T12:05:00Z,2019-04-30T12:04:00Z,RFA-CA-15-002,nofo_RFA-CA-15-002,UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO,ALBUQUERQUE,nm,UNITED STATES,imat,org_state,False
5R21CA212726-04,R21CA212726,9724420,2019,A molecular toolkit for the production of tyrosine phosphorylated proteins,"Project Summary Tyrosine phosphorylation can regulate protein function, and this is a cornerstone of cell signaling networks. Ty- rosine phosphorylation often becomes dysregulated in cancer and therefore, understanding the effect of phos- phorylation on protein function will be paramount to identifying therapeutic interventions in cancer. Unfortunately, an important tool in the basic research of phosphorylation – testing the effect of protein phosphorylation by com- paring the function of the phosphorylated form with an unphosphorylated form of the protein in in vitro assays – is signiﬁcantly hindered by our limited knowledge in how to make a phosphorylated protein. This project seeks to build a molecular technology, inspired by previous observations of biochemistry in cell networks, to overcome this requirement and improve the pace of basic research. The goal of this research is to build a fast, accessible and inexpensive method for producing phosphorylated and soluble proteins in a bacterial system. The goals will be achieved by: development of a molecular toolkit for the enhancement and control of precise phosphorylation on protein substrates using secondary kinase-substrate targeting approaches, testing the toolkit on a set of sub- strates, and comparing the outcome with current technologies. It is anticipated that this technology will be less expensive, more physiologically-relevant, and capable of producing a larger variety of phosphorylated forms of proteins than current molecular approaches to studying the effect of protein phosphorylation.",Amino Acid Sequence;Automobile Driving;Basic Cancer Research;Basic Science;Binding;Biochemical;Biochemistry;Biological;Biological Assay;Cells;Development;Engineering;Escherichia coli;Glutamic Acid;Goals;Grant;Human;Kinetics;Knowledge;Libraries;Malignant Neoplasms;Mass Spectrum Analysis;Measurement;Measures;Methods;Molecular;Molecular Bank;Mutate;Outcome;Pattern;Phosphoproteins;Phosphorylation;Phosphotransferases;Phosphotyrosine;Physiological;Post-Translational Protein Processing;Process;Production;Property;Proteins;Proteome;Recombinant Proteins;Recombinants;Regulation;Research;Research Personnel;SH3 Domains;Signal Transduction;Specificity;Substrate Domain;Substrate Specificity;System;Technology;Testing;Therapeutic Intervention;Thick;Tyrosine;Tyrosine Phosphorylation;Work;base;improved;in vitro Assay;polyproline;protein function;src Homology Region 2 Domain;technology development;tool;vector,Kristen M Naegle,Anowarul Amin,184556,184556,2019-07-09T12:07:00Z,2017-08-16T12:08:00Z,2021-07-31T12:07:00Z,RFA-CA-16-001,nofo_RFA-CA-16-001,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,CHARLOTTESVILLE,va,UNITED STATES,imat,org_state,False
5R21CA258013-02,R21CA258013,10417132,2022,Device for Preservation of Cell Free RNA in Saliva,"ABSTRACT Early detection is critical to cancer mortality reductions, and yet the breast imaging clinic visits required for these life-saving early detection programs are inaccessible to disadvantaged, remote, or quarantined populations with limited medical facility access. In fact, breast cancer surveillance programs this year have stalled by as much as 90% versus their pre-pandemic rates, resulting in risky delays in new cancer diagnosis [1]. A saliva-based test for early detection could transform today’s screening paradigms. A promising biofluid for disease detection, saliva can be self-sampled non-invasively, without trained technicians. Saliva is ideal for at-home and other non-clinical site collection; it contains a variety of analytes including exosomes, RNA, DNA, proteins, metabolites, viruses and oral microflora, and is a powerful window on health and disease. Recently, saliva samples have shown better clinical utility vs. nasal swabs for detecting COVID-19 [2]. Mounting evidence exists for oral microbiome links to systemic disease [3], and salivary biomarkers diagnose complex traits such as pediatric medical conditions, traumatic brain injury, autism, and cancer [4-7]. A commercial saliva-based test for autism is based on 32 human and microbial RNA markers [8]. In many complex trait studies, saliva is frozen as cell-free supernatant. The most prevalent saliva collection and preservation devices, although easy-to-use, preclude effective cell-free RNA and exosome analysis, since saliva samples are treated with lysis reagents resulting in mixed populations of cellular and non-cellular RNAs, increasing noise and damaging performance characteristics. Saliva collection devices that instead use membranes to separate cells suffer from inefficient recovery of critical analytes, either because they lack appropriate preservatives or because they adsorb and therefore lose, a substantial analyte fraction. To enable widespread use for disease detection, new standardized methods are needed to preserve cell-free saliva and retain the integrity of its key constituents for stable transport and downstream analysis. This project extends our past SBIR grant work and our own internal research, to develop an easy-to-use saliva collection and preservation device to stabilize cfRNA and other analytes, enabling us and others to efficiently collect high-quality clinical saliva samples. Using RT-qPCR assays and RNA isotype profiles, we will characterize salivary cfRNA integrity and stability over timelines sufficient for remote collection and transport. Armed with well-characterized RNA decay profiles, we propose an iterative design-of-experiment approach to prototype a versatile device to collect and preserve saliva at room temperature (RT), stabilizing RNA while also preventing cell lysis and bacterial growth. Our device performance validation will use prospectively collected and preserved saliva from >50 women to demonstrate stability for up 72 hours at ambient conditions. This device will standardize methods for collection, stability, and transport of saliva, key to driving virtualized sample collection and healthcare in cancer, viral, and other diagnostics, increasingly critical to a post-pandemic world.",Adoption;Automobile Driving;Biocide;Biological Assay;Biological Markers;Blood specimen;Breast Cancer Detection;COVID-19;COVID-19 detection;COVID-19 pandemic;Cells;Centrifugation;Characteristics;Childhood;Clinic;Clinic Visits;Clinical;Clinical Research;Collection;Complex;Cytolysis;DNA;Detection;Development;Devices;Diagnosis;Diagnostic;Diagnostic tests;Disadvantaged;Disease;Early Diagnosis;Facility Accesses;Feedback;Fractionation;Freezing;Future;Genomics;Grant;Growth;Health;Healthcare;Home;Hour;Human;Image;Individual;Laboratories;Life;Link;Malignant Neoplasms;Manuals;Measurement;Measures;Medical;Medicine;Membrane;Methods;Microbe;Mixed Cellular Population;Molecular;Monitor;Noise;Nucleic Acids;Office Visits;Participant;Patients;Performance;Phase;Population;Process;Property;Quarantine;RNA;RNA Decay;RNA Degradation;RNA Stability;RNA marker;Reagent;Recovery;Research;Saliva;Salivary;Sampling;Savings;Ships;Site;Small Business Innovation Research Grant;Standardization;Surveillance Program;Systemic disease;Temperature;Testing;TimeLine;Training;Traumatic Brain Injury;Validation;Venous blood sampling;Viral;Virus;Woman;Work;autism spectrum disorder;base;biomarker panel;breast imaging;cancer diagnosis;clinical diagnostics;cost;design;exosome;experimental study;innovation;iterative design;malignant breast neoplasm;microbial;microbiota;microorganism growth;mortality;nasal swab;next generation sequencing;nuclease;oral microbial community;oral microbiome;pandemic disease;participant enrollment;pathogen;point of care;post-COVID-19;preservation;prevent;programs;prospective;protein metabolite;prototype;saliva sample;salivary assay;salivary cell;sample collection;screening;trait;usability;virtual,Shivani Nautiyal,Guillermo Marquez,9568,9568,2022-07-18T12:07:00Z,2021-06-03T12:06:00Z,2023-04-03T12:04:00Z,RFA-CA-20-019,nofo_RFA-CA-20-019,"PRIME GENOMICS, INC.",Mountain View,ca,UNITED STATES,imat,org_state,False
5R33CA083232-05,R33CA083232,6914916,2005,APTAMER BASED DETECTOR TO QUANTIFY MACROMOLECULES,"DESCRIPTION: (Applicant's Description) We propose to develop a technology to simultaneously detect and quantify large numbers individual proteins and post-translationally modified proteins. This technology will be based on a spatially-arrayed aptamer microchip and sensitive fluorescence-based optical detection techniques. The system will provide a powerful new tool for biomedical research and diagnosis of diseases and cancers. Currently, the levels of cellular proteins are inferred from cellular mRNA levels by using DNA oligonucleotide microchips. These microchips allow the detection of mRNA levels by base-pairing interactions to homologous DNA oligomers located at different sites in the microchip array. However, this indirect assay of protein levels suffers from two problems: First, mRNA levels may not accurately reflect the level of encoded protein because translation and degradation rates vary from protein to protein and are regulated in response to cell physiology. Second, post-translational modifications proteins often alter critical protein activities.

This technology will be based on a spatially-arrayed aptamer microchip and sensitive fluorescence-based optical detection techniques. The system will provide a powerful new tool for biomedical research and diagnosis of diseases and cancers. Currently, the levels of cellular proteins are inferred from cellular mRNA levels by using DNA oligonucleotide microchips. These microchips allow the detection of mRNA levels by base-pairing interactions to homologous DNA oligomers located at different sites in the microchip array. However, this indirect assay of protein levels suffers from two problems: First, mRNA levels may not accurately reflect the level of encoded protein because translation and degradation rates vary from protein to protein and are regulated in response to cell physiology. Second, post-translational modifications proteins often alter critical protein activities. This technology we propose to develop is comprised of three parts: 1) Aptamers with high-affinity and high-specifity for individual proteins. These aptamers will be designed to have ligand-dependent changes in fluorescence properties. 2) A microchip array with each array site occupied by aptamers against a different target molecule. 3) An evanescent field fluorescence detector which detects target molecules binding to aptamers at the array sites.

We request a 1-year R21 phase and a 3-year R33 phase. The proposed project involves collaboration between members of Northwestern's Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center, including researchers in Chemical Engineering, the Medical School, and Evanston Hospital. Microchannel ""tandem"" SSCP/HA is a novel mutation detection method recently developed in our laboratory, which involves the simultaneous generation and analysis of homo/heteroduplex DNA and SSCP conformers. Studies of a significant number of samples (32) indicate that tandem SSCP/HA allows for much higher-sensitivity mutation detection (100%) than SSCP alone (93%) or HA alone (75%), for p53 samples. We have developed and published optimized sample preparation protocols, gel formulations, and analysis conditions for capillary array electrophoresis (CAE). During the R21 phase, we will translate these methods to microfluidic electrophoresis chips, which offer a large increase in throughput and drop in cost of DNA analysis compared to CAE. The p53 gene, known to be mutated in >50% of human cancers, and whose mutation status can be predictive of patient response to chemotherapy, is the important model system chosen. However, microchip-based genetic analysis technologies to be developed should be easily applied to ANY cancer-related gene. In the R21 phase, we will analyze approximately 60 different DNA samples derived from tumor cell lines, representing a range of mutations in different p53 exons, to determine the impact of DNA sample characteristics and electrophoresis protocols on the sensitivity and specificity of the method, in a blinded study designed by collaborating biostatisticians.

5R33CA105514-03,R33CA105514,7108593,2006,Assaying Tyrosine Kinase Activity: A New Paradigm,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): New approaches are needed in the molecular analyses of the growth-promoting signal transduction pathways involved in the development and maintenance of cancer. The Laser Micropipet System (LMS), a new technology for the biochemical assay of kinases, holds the promise of directly assaying the activities of protein tyrosine kinases in primary patient cells. The LMS was developed for the assay of serine/threonine kinases in individual cells grown in tissue culture. This R21/R33 application proposes to expand the applications of this instrumentation to directly determine the activity of oncogenic tyrosine kinases in primary cells from patients. Assay of Bcr-Abl in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) will demonstrate the power of this tool for research, clinical, and pharmacologic applications. While this assay will be of value in the study of the biology and resistance mechanisms in CML, the studies will lay the groundwork for a new paradigm in the study of molecular mechanisms in cancer signal transduction and will have general applicability. The R21 phase of this proposal is designed to establish the feasibility of assaying Bcr-Abl activity and to demonstrate the necessary assay conditions for measurements in cells derived from a patient with CML. The specific aims are to: 1) identify and characterize a reporter of intracellular Bcr-Ab1 kinase activity, 2) define and optimize conditions for measuring Bcr-Ab1 activity in human cells, 3) compare reporter phosphorylation in cells expressing Bcr-Ab1 vs. cells lacking this kinase, and 4) demonstrate the feasibility of using primary patient cells in kinase assays. The goal of the R33 phase is to demonstrate the potential for the LMS-based kinase assay in applications for the study of the biology of pharmacologic resistance in CML, including from primary patient cells. The R33 specific aims are to: 1) develop a membrane-permeant Bcr-Ab1 kinase reporter, 2) demonstrate the ability to detect imatinib resistance in CML cell lines, 3) determine Bcr-Ab1 activity in primary cells from patients with CML and their response to pharmacologic inhibition, and 4) determine if the assay can detect the emergence of imatinib resistance in CML patients and can differentiate the mechanisms of drug resistance.",biological signal transduction;capillary electrophoresis;carcinogenesis;cell growth regulation;chronic myelogenous leukemia;clinical research;enzyme activity;enzyme mechanism;gene expression;human subject;intracellular;neoplastic cell;oncoproteins;phosphorylation;protein purification;protein tyrosine kinase;reporter genes;single cell analysis;technology /technique development,Christopher E Sims,Min-Kyung H Song,379961,379961,2006-08-01T12:08:00Z,2005-08-08T12:08:00Z,2007-06-30T12:06:00Z,PAR-01-106,nofo_PAR-01-106,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,IRVINE,ca,UNITED STATES,imat,org_state,False

Extant proteomics methods are limited to quantifying a few thousands of the most abundant proteins and, therefore, are unsuitable for the targeted profiling of less abundant farnesylated expression. The major goal of this application is to develop and validate a powerful technology, Tagging via Azido Substrate (TAS), for the efficient isolation of farnesylated proteins. This technology will then be applied to the proteomics analysis of farnesylated proteins in physiologically relevant models. The TAS technology involves the introduction of a synthetic azide-modified farnesyl substrate, either farnesyl azide diphosphate (FPP-azide) or farnesyl azide alcohol (F-azide-OH), which replaces the natural substrate during cellular protein farnesylation. The resulting farnesyl-azide (F-azide)-modified proteins will be affinity-purified through an azide-specific conjugation reaction (Staudinger reaction) using a phosphine capture reagent linked to photo-cleavable beads, which can then be released by UV light-induced photo-cleavage. Since affinity purification relies on covalent bonding resulting from a specific conjugation reaction between an azide and phosphine capture reagent, other proteins without the F-azide modification can be effectively removed by thorough washing. Thus, the TAS technology will allow farnesylated proteins to be isolated with high yield, high specificity, and low contamination. The initial focus of the R21 portion of this proposal is on the development of TAS technology and its application to the isolation of farnesylated proteins. These studies will be extended subsequently to geranylgeranylated proteins. The R33 proposal will aim at applications of the TAS technology to the identification of novel FTI targets.

5R33CA114149-03,R33CA114149,7283630,2007,Imaging tumor associated fibroblast activation protein,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this research is to develop a novel fibroblast activation protein (FAP) sensing near infrared fluorescence reporter for early tumor detection and tumor classification. FAP is a cell surface antigen of reactive tumor stromal fibroblasts founded in more than 90% of epithelial carcinomas, but it is absent from epithelial carcinoma cells, normal fibroblasts, and other normal human tissue. Supporting tumor stromal fibroblasts are generally localized close to tumor vasculature, which is essential for early tumor development and growth. Thus it has been chosen as a target for monoclonal antibody based tumor therapy. FAP is not only a membrane protein but also a dipeptidyl peptidase. An imaging probe to report enzymatic activity and location of FAP could be extremely useful for early tumor detection. In this application we will develop a small molecular probe with ultra-sensitivity based on a unique class of fluorogenic chromophore that has significant changes in emission at different chemical states. Specifically, the probes emit no fluorescence in their initial intact state but become brightly fluorescent after specific proteolytic reaction. The newly developed low molecular weight, well defined fluorogenic probes are expected to have several advantages for imaging: a) fast tissue distribution allowing earlier imaging after injection, b) fast clearance allowing repeated imaging, and c) high likelihood of developing key candidates into clinically useful agents. The choice of FAP is based on its importance in tumor growth, invasion, and other processes in oncogenesis. Together with recent developments in fluorescence imaging technologies, this research is expected to ultimately result in clinical imaging agents with specificity for targeted enzymes. We believe that the developed approach can be used as a platform to design a broad spectrum of activatable molecular probes to image other amino peptidases in vivo.",Carcinoma;Chemicals;Class;Classification;Clinical;Detection;Development;Dipeptidyl Peptidases;Drug or chemical Tissue Distribution;Enzymes;Fibroblasts;Fluorescence;Goals;Growth and Development function;Image;Imaging technology;Injection of therapeutic agent;Localized;Location;Malignant Epithelial Cell;Membrane Proteins;Molecular Probes;Molecular Weight;Monoclonal Antibodies;Peptide Hydrolases;Process;Reaction;Reporter;Reporting;Research;Specificity;Stromal Neoplasm;Surface Antigens;base;chromophore;design;fibroblast-activating factor;fluorescence imaging;human tissue;imaging probe;in vivo;novel;tumor;tumor growth;tumorigenesis,Ching-Hsuan Tung,James W.

For example, Otto Warburg and others discovered that tumors have increased glucose uptake, glycolysis, and lactate production, often with a reduction in citric acid cycle. While “aerobic glycolysis” at first glance is energetically expensive for tumor cells because it circumvents high ATP production from the citric acid cycle, it allows cancer cells to survive under low nutrient or low oxygen conditions and to instead use glycolytic intermediates for the synthesis of essential cellular building blocks without further energy investment. This change in metabolite regulation suggests a powerful method for monitoring and diagnosing cancer. This project seeks to develop surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) as online detection method for the characterization of metabolites from breast cancer tumor models. Using the SERS results from tumor lysates, diagnostic algorithms will be constructed to improve treatment for cancer. Results show that fluid dynamics can be used to increase the reproducibility and sensitivity of SERS detection in flowing liquids. We propose to develop methodology to enable the use this innovation to investigate metabolites in cancer cell lysates using capillary electrophoresis coupled to a SERS flow detector. We will investigate known metabolites that have been linked to cancer, as well as examine key metabolites associated with oncogenes. The SERS data collected will be used to formulate diagnostic algorithms that can provide a yes/no indicator of cancer. The specific aims of this project are as follows: · AIM 1. Demonstrate the utility of the novel flow detector to assess changes in key metabolites from tumor cell lysates. The tumor cell lysates will be compared with non-cancerous cell lysates to identify trends in these metabolites relevant to breast cancer. · AIM 2. Compare the identification and quantification capabilities with the current gold standard, LC- MS. This aim will assess how SERS characterization both compares with existing technology but also increases coverage of the metabolome. · AIM 3. We will use the metabolites to develop statistical machine learning algorithms to predict the sample label (cancer or not). The predictor obtained will be used as a diagnostic tool of cancer.

We propose to develop methodology to enable the use this innovation to investigate metabolites in cancer cell lysates using capillary electrophoresis coupled to a SERS flow detector. We will investigate known metabolites that have been linked to cancer, as well as examine key metabolites associated with oncogenes. The SERS data collected will be used to formulate diagnostic algorithms that can provide a yes/no indicator of cancer. The specific aims of this project are as follows: · AIM 1. Demonstrate the utility of the novel flow detector to assess changes in key metabolites from tumor cell lysates. The tumor cell lysates will be compared with non-cancerous cell lysates to identify trends in these metabolites relevant to breast cancer. · AIM 2. Compare the identification and quantification capabilities with the current gold standard, LC- MS. This aim will assess how SERS characterization both compares with existing technology but also increases coverage of the metabolome. · AIM 3. We will use the metabolites to develop statistical machine learning algorithms to predict the sample label (cancer or not). The predictor obtained will be used as a diagnostic tool of cancer. The development of new technologies that provide unique chemical specific information will enable improved diagnostic assays for the treatment of cancer.",Algorithms;Biological Assay;Biological Markers;Capillary Electrophoresis;Cells;Chemical Structure;Chemicals;Chromatography;Citric Acid Cycle;Comb animal structure;Complex;Coupled;Data;Detection;Development;Developmental Process;Diagnosis;Diagnostic;Disease;Exhibits;Explosion;Fingerprint;Gases;Gene Expression;Gene Expression Profiling;Gene Proteins;Glycolysis;Goals;Gold;Investigation;Investments;Isomerism;Label;Laboratories;Link;Liquid substance;Machine Learning;Malignant Neoplasms;Mass Spectrum Analysis;Metabolic;Metabolism;Methodology;Methods;Modeling;Monitor;Normal Cell;Nuclear Magnetic Resonance;Nutrient;Oncogenes;Oxygen;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Play;Production;Prognostic Marker;Public Health;Raman Spectrum Analysis;Regulation;Reproducibility;Research;Resistance development;Resolution;Sampling;Surface;Techniques;Technology;Time;aerobic glycolysis;base;cancer biomarkers;cancer cell;cancer diagnosis;cancer therapy;chemical property;clinically relevant;cost;detector;diagnostic assay;effective therapy;glucose uptake;improved;innovation;malignant breast neoplasm;mass spectrometer;metabolome;metabolomics;neoplastic cell;new technology;novel;novel diagnostics;patient subsets;personalized medicine;prognostic;prognostic value;protein profiling;success;synergism;therapeutic target;therapy resistant;tool;treatment strategy;trend;tumor;tumor metabolism;tumor progression,Zachary Schultz,Brian S Sorg,305997,305997,2018-07-13T12:07:00Z,2016-08-01T12:08:00Z,2020-07-31T12:07:00Z,RFA-CA-15-003,nofo_RFA-CA-15-003,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,COLUMBUS,oh,UNITED STATES,imat,org_state,False

However, their widespread use is limited by a number of difficulties in manufacturing such cells. Current manufacturing processes are complicated, costly, and can only produce cells for small populations. Additionally, they have large production variations. As a result, different patients receive very different products or treatments. The long-term goal is to develop a novel technology to address the CAR T manufacturing challenge. Toward this goal, the team has developed a proof- of-concept technology termed stress-free intra-tubular cell culture technology (SFIT). SFIT provides cells uniform, highly reproducible, controllable, and cell-friendly microenvironments, resulting in extremely high culture efficiency and consistency. SFIT produces cells for each patient with one small conical tube, significantly reducing production cost and increasing production capability. The purpose of this project is to further develop and validate this technology and the associated methods to make it ready for the final translational challenge. Leveraging sound preliminary studies and a diverse team of experts, the specific aims are to (1) validate SFIT for culturing T cells from a wide range of donors and for culturing various T cell subtypes, (2) further develop and validate methods for transducing T cells with lentivirus and γ-retrovirus in SFIT, and (3) further develop and validate the SFIT-based single-conical-tube-device for producing autologous CAR T cells. The project will build on the team’s strong preliminary work and include mathematical modeling, prototype device design, extensive T cell culturing, exome-Seq and RNA-Seq data analyses, in vivo testing, statistical analyses and comparisons, and partnership with ADS BIOTEC, a company that designs, builds, and sells instruments for processing human cells. With the completion of this project, simple, disposable, affordable devices for the scalable, cost-effective and consistent production of autologous CAR T cells are expected. This technology can also be scaled up for producing allogeneic CAR T cells in large scales if needed. This technology will not only make CAR T cells broadly accessible, but also make the product much more consistent and predictable. Based on 2012-2014 data, approximately 38.5% of the human population will be diagnosed with some type of cancer during their lifetime. Currently, only about 67% of cancer patients will survive five years after diagnosis. CAR T cell therapy is expected to significantly increase their chances of survival. The technology developed in this proposal will make CAR T cells available to many patients.",3-Dimensional;Address;Adopted;Alginates;Allogenic;Autologous;B lymphoid malignancy;CAR T cell therapy;Caliber;Cancer Patient;Cell Aggregation;Cell Culture Techniques;Cell Death;Cells;Clinical Research;Cultured Cells;Data;Data Analyses;Development;Device Designs;Devices;Diagnosis;Diffusion;Disease;Dose;Ensure;Environmental Risk Factor;Gammaretrovirus;Genetic;Genetic Engineering;Geometry;Goals;Human;Hydrogels;Malignant Neoplasms;Methods;Outcome;Patients;Population;Process;Production;Protocols documentation;Quality of life;Radial;Reproducibility;Solid Neoplasm;Statistical Data Interpretation;Stress;Subfamily lentivirinae;Suspension Culture;T-Lymphocyte;Technology;Time;Translations;Treatment Cost;Tube;Tubular formation;Variant;Virus;Work;base;cancer therapy;cancer type;cell growth;chimeric antigen receptor;chimeric antigen receptor T cells;clinically relevant;cost;cost effective;design;exome sequencing;improved;in vivo;in vivo evaluation;instrument;manufacturing process;mathematical model;new technology;novel;operation;preclinical study;prototype;scale up;shear stress;sound;success;therapy development;transcriptome sequencing;transduction efficiency;tumor,Yuguo Lei,Lokesh Agrawal,353619,353619,2020-02-27T12:02:00Z,2019-03-19T12:03:00Z,2020-12-31T12:12:00Z,RFA-CA-18-005,nofo_RFA-CA-18-005,UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA LINCOLN,LINCOLN,ne,UNITED STATES,imat,org_state,False
6R21CA258013-03,R21CA258013,10888835,2022,Device for Preservation of Cell Free RNA in Saliva,"ABSTRACT Early detection is critical to cancer mortality reductions, and yet the breast imaging clinic visits required for these life-saving early detection programs are inaccessible to disadvantaged, remote, or quarantined populations with limited medical facility access. In fact, breast cancer surveillance programs this year have stalled by as much as 90% versus their pre-pandemic rates, resulting in risky delays in new cancer diagnosis [1]. A saliva-based test for early detection could transform today’s screening paradigms. A promising biofluid for disease detection, saliva can be self-sampled non-invasively, without trained technicians. Saliva is ideal for at-home and other non-clinical site collection; it contains a variety of analytes including exosomes, RNA, DNA, proteins, metabolites, viruses and oral microflora, and is a powerful window on health and disease. Recently, saliva samples have shown better clinical utility vs. nasal swabs for detecting COVID-19 [2]. Mounting evidence exists for oral microbiome links to systemic disease [3], and salivary biomarkers diagnose complex traits such as pediatric medical conditions, traumatic brain injury, autism, and cancer [4-7]. A commercial saliva-based test for autism is based on 32 human and microbial RNA markers [8]. In many complex trait studies, saliva is frozen as cell-free supernatant. The most prevalent saliva collection and preservation devices, although easy-to-use, preclude effective cell-free RNA and exosome analysis, since saliva samples are treated with lysis reagents resulting in mixed populations of cellular and non-cellular RNAs, increasing noise and damaging performance characteristics. Saliva collection devices that instead use membranes to separate cells suffer from inefficient recovery of critical analytes, either because they lack appropriate preservatives or because they adsorb and therefore lose, a substantial analyte fraction. To enable widespread use for disease detection, new standardized methods are needed to preserve cell-free saliva and retain the integrity of its key constituents for stable transport and downstream analysis. This project extends our past SBIR grant work and our own internal research, to develop an easy-to-use saliva collection and preservation device to stabilize cfRNA and other analytes, enabling us and others to efficiently collect high-quality clinical saliva samples. Using RT-qPCR assays and RNA isotype profiles, we will characterize salivary cfRNA integrity and stability over timelines sufficient for remote collection and transport. Armed with well-characterized RNA decay profiles, we propose an iterative design-of-experiment approach to prototype a versatile device to collect and preserve saliva at room temperature (RT), stabilizing RNA while also preventing cell lysis and bacterial growth. Our device performance validation will use prospectively collected and preserved saliva from >50 women to demonstrate stability for up 72 hours at ambient conditions. This device will standardize methods for collection, stability, and transport of saliva, key to driving virtualized sample collection and healthcare in cancer, viral, and other diagnostics, increasingly critical to a post-pandemic world.",,Shivani Nautiyal,Guillermo Marquez,218184,218184,2024-08-01T12:08:00Z,2021-06-03T12:06:00Z,2025-05-31T12:05:00Z,RFA-CA-20-019,nofo_RFA-CA-20-019,"NOWDIAGNOSTICS, INC.",SPRINGDALE,ar,UNITED STATES,imat,org_state,False
7R21CA112149-02,R21CA112149,7472827,2005,Automated Cell Preparation in Tubes for 3D Microscopy,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): 3D microscopy represents a powerful new cell analysis tool for early detection and diagnosis of cancer, but its future use may be limited because methods for preparation of samples are cumbersome, inefficient, labor intensive and generally imprecise. Current methods for cytological sample collection are manual and distributed in nature through various physicians' office laboratories and local hospitals, with the actual analysis being centralized at regional clinical laboratories. Among the cytological specimens are sputum, gynecological and colorectal scrapes, fine needle aspirates, urinary tract, and gastrointestinal samples. We propose the development of a new automated system that will transform these difficult and messy clinical specimens into an optimal format for 3D microscopy morphological and molecular analysis. The model and method we propose is comprised of three sequential steps. First, at the distributed site, an automated sample processor dissociates and fixes cells and debris for shipment in an automation compatible canister. Second, after shipment to a centralized clinical laboratory, the specimen canisters are loaded into an automatic processor that performs cleanup (debris removal), specimen/assay specific staining (and counterstaining), and finally embedding of cells of interest in glass microcapillary tubes (about 50 mu m ID), with cells being spaced at regular intervals (about 200 mu m) within a tube. This preparation format is uniquely suited for integration with multiple 3D imaging platforms for true 3D volumetric assessment of cell morphology and molecular probe and/or stain density distribution. The proposed system also enables use of cytometric flow sorting for enrichment of cells of interest at an intermediate stage of the sample preparation process. The potential impact to improved human health through rapid diagnostic screening will be illustrated using a high impact emerging technology, optical tomography. In summary, the aim of the proposed project is to develop, design, and build a complete sample processing system that automates the process of sample cleanup, assay specific staining, and mounting of cells into glass microcapillary tubes, and a tube positioning and rotation scanner mechanism for 3D microscopy analysis of cell morphology for the early detection of cancer.",bioimaging /biomedical imaging;biomedical automation;cell morphology;clinical research;cytodiagnosis;early diagnosis;flow cytometry;high throughput technology;human tissue;molecular probes;neoplasm /cancer diagnosis;technology /technique development;three dimensional imaging /topography;tissue /cell preparation,Deirdre R.

The assay proposed relies on an electro catalytic process involving two transition-metal ions that reports on biomolecular complexation events. Because the reporter system responds to changes in the electrostatics of an electrode surface, it will enable the analysis of nucleic acids/protein and peptide/protein complexes. The proposed project has 3 specific aims: 1) electro catalytic detection of DNA repair proteins implicated in cancer using DNA-modified electrodes; 2) optimization of electro catalytic detection and multiplexed analysis of cellular DNA repair activities, and 3) development of a generalized electro catalytic protein detection method using prostate cancer biomarkers. The electro catalytic protein detection system described is advantageous because it will allow the analysis and discrimination of multiprotein complexes in addition to uncomplexed analytes and will have high selectivity and specificity. Additionally, the protein detection assays will be conducted using nanoelectrodes that will allow multiplexed detection of panels of different biomolecular targets.",DNA binding protein;DNA repair;biomarker;biotechnology;carbonates;electrochemistry;electrodes;high throughput technology;nanotechnology;oligonucleotides;prostate neoplasms;prostate specific antigen;protein quantitation /detection;synthetic nucleotide;technology /technique development,Shana O Kelley,John R Knowlton,105462,105462,2007-05-02T12:05:00Z,2005-06-21T12:06:00Z,2008-05-31T12:05:00Z,RFA-CA-05-002,nofo_RFA-CA-05-002,UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO,TORONTO,on,CANADA,imat,org_state,False
7R21CA114852-03,R21CA114852,7365035,2006,Profile serum proteins by glycopeptide capture and LC-MS,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancers develop over a period of several years and they are characterized by molecular changes prior to invasion and metastasis. Development of a technology that enables screening of cancer from body fluids could permit cancer detection at early and treatable stages. It is expected that the composition of the serum proteome contains valuable information about the state of the human body in health and disease, and that this information can be extracted via quantitative proteomic measurements. Suitable proteomic techniques need to be sensitive, reproducible and robust, to detect potential biomarkers below the level of highly expressed proteins, to generate data sets that are comparable between experiments and laboratories, and have high throughput to support studies with sufficient statistical power. In this proposal, we will develop a method for high throughput quantitative analysis of serum proteins. It consists of the selective isolation of the peptides that are N-linked glycosylated in the intact protein using solid-phase extraction of glycopeptides (SPEG) on a robotic workstation, the analysis of these now de-glycosylated peptides by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS), and the comparative analysis of the resulting patterns. By focusing selectively on a few formerly N-linked glycopeptides per serum protein, the complexity of the analyte sample is significantly reduced, and the sensitivity, reproducibility, and throughput of serum proteome analysis are increased compared with the analysis of total tryptic peptides from unfractionated samples. We will explore the feasibility to identify cancer-specific serum proteins in the background of normal variation using a carcinogen-induced skin cancer mouse model. The specific aims are: 1) To develop chemistries and protocols for an automatic robotic system to isolate N-linked glycopeptides from serum in a high throughput and highly reproducible fashion; 2) To develop efficient and reproducible procedures for LC-MS analyses, and sequence identification of discriminatory peptides by tandem mass spectrometry; 3) To explore the feasibility of this method for the identification of distinctive serum peptides specific to cancer-bearing mice in the background of normal variations. If successful, the proposed research could subsequently be used for profiling human serum samples from cancer patients and normal individuals to identify the cancer-associated proteins in serum. The identified biomarkers will open a new paradigm for performing screening and detection of human cancer at early stage and for clinical therapeutic management.",biomarker;biomedical automation;biotechnology;blood proteins;glycopeptides;high throughput technology;laboratory mouse;liquid chromatography mass spectrometry;neoplasm /cancer diagnosis;proteomics;technology /technique development,Hui Zhang,John R Knowlton,113491,113491,2007-04-05T12:04:00Z,2005-06-13T12:06:00Z,2008-05-31T12:05:00Z,RFA-CA-05-002,nofo_RFA-CA-05-002,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,BALTIMORE,md,UNITED STATES,imat,org_state,False
7R21CA116060-03,R21CA116060,7569614,2006,REVERSIBLE PROMOTER-INSERTION FOR IN VIVO STUDIES OF MELANOMA,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is commonly accepted that the processes underlying the development of cancer are best modeled in vivo. A plethora of methods have been developed for genetic dissection of biological processes in somatic cells in culture; however, the adaptation of these techniques to in vivo use has been very limited. Our earlier experience indicates that reversible promoter-insertion mutagenesis offers a number of advantages over the currently used forward genetics techniques for cultured cells. The most important benefits are the dominant nature of the mutations, and the ease of identifying the affected gene and establishing the causal link between the mutation and the phenotype. The principal limitation for the adaptation of this technique to in vivo studies is the delivery of the insertional mutagen (typically, a retroviral vector) to the desired cell type. Based on our recent experience and published data from others, we propose a method to circumvent this limitation via the use of specially engineered transposon vectors. We propose to apply our technique to study the genetic events underlying melanoma development. We will screen for genetic events that cooperate with oncogenic Ras (commonly found in melanomas) in this process. We will confirm the properties of the proposed insertional mutagens in culture and then proceed to establish mouse strains suitable for mutagenesis. Upon verifying the properties of our constructs in vivo, we will selectively mutagenize melanocytes in transgenic animals and will test the functional link between tumorigenesis and the inserted promoter. Confirmed hits will be the subject of future investigation, while the technique itself will become available for dissection of various biological phenomena in general and aspects of tumorigenesis, in particular.",biomarker;biotechnology;cell line;gene mutation;genetically modified animals;guanine nucleotide binding protein;laboratory mouse;melanocyte;melanoma;neoplasm /cancer genetics;oncogenes;technology /technique development;tetracyclines;tissue /cell culture;transfection /expression vector;transposon /insertion element,Eugene S Kandel,Jennifer A.

7R21CA123018-03,R21CA123018,7797760,2007,Epigenetic Targeting in Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hypermethylation of promoter CpG islands plays a prominent role in cancer. In partnership with alterations in histone acetylation/methylation, this epigenetic event establishes a repressive chromatin structure that leads to silencing of key cancer-related genes. The occurrence of DNA methylation within the genome is not random, but rather patterns of methylation are generated that are gene and tumor type specific. How DNA methylation patterns are established is still poorly understood. Since various transcriptional factors or regulators are found in association with DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) in vivo, we hypothesize that: 1) Oncogenic transcription factors can recruit DNMTs to target gene promoters and define a unique epigenetic signature in tumor cells; 2) Dissecting such complex epigenetic hierarchy will identify novel molecular targets for diagnosis, prognosis and therapeutic intervention. To test our hypothesis, we developed a high throughput technique for genome wide analysis of DNA methylation associated with specific proteins such as histones, transcription factors or any DNA binding proteins. The new approach named ChlP-Chop-DMH will combine both genome wide location analysis (also known as ChlP-on-Chip) and Differential Methylation Hybridization (DMH) analysis, two emerging technologies used in epigenetic research. The proposed method has distinct advantages over current protocols: first, this method directly examines the in vivo interaction of specific proteins with methylated DNA throughout the genome; second, this method may uncover novel biological properties of transcription factors; third, this method can be applied to discover novel epigenetic biomarkers relevant to tumorigenesis. In preliminary studies, we have verified the utility of this method with methylated histone H3 at lysine 9 and lysine 4 in human cancer cells. In the R21 phase, we will continue minor refinement of the method and pursue three aims: 1) Improve and optimize the ChlP-Chop-DMH method for analyzing genome wide association of DNA methylation with histone modification; 2) Utilize the proposed method to investigate the association of DNA methylation with chromatin remodeling factors: 3) Show proof-of-concept using the array to examine primary non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHLs). In this development phase we will focus on the sensitivity, reproducibility and accuracy of the proposed method. In the R33 phase, our goal is to utilize the technology to test biological hypotheses. We will fully implement the method and pursue these aims: 1) Discover epigenetic target genes associated with known oncogenic transcription factors c-Myc and BCL6: 2) Validate the identified epigenetic targets and investigate the regulatory role of the associated oncogenic transcription factors.

7R21CA173303-03,R21CA173303,8819875,2013,Controlled premature termination of translation to generate designated truncated,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many diseases, including several forms of cancer, depend on the inappropriate expression of pathological proteins, such as oncogenes. Frequently, the structure-function of these proteins belies a modular construction, with an essential functional domain in the C-terminal portion of the protein (for example the transactivation domain of a transcription factor). Mutants lacking the C-terminal domain can have altered and antagonistic functions, and in some cases they can behave as dominant- negative variants. Such variants are sometimes naturally generated by alternative splicing/polyadenylation. However, these are not always present or not easily activatable. A method to specifically induce these dominant negative variants would be highly desirable and have a significant therapeutic potential in a broad range of diseases, including cancer. In order to generate a pre-designed, desirable truncated variant instead of the pathological one we propose development of a novel universal methodology, based on a brand new design of antisense molecules that are able to redirect termination of translation from the normally translated full-length ORF to an upstream specified location. These Self-Wrapping Antisense Translation Termination (SWATT) compounds work by introducing an insurmountable steric block that cannot be resolved by the helicase activity of incoming translating ribosomes, which can normally unwind extensive secondary structures within the pre-mRNA. This roadblock would thus result in ribosome drop-off and expression of a shorter, C-terminally truncated variant. We will validate the viability of this novel strategy by assessing SWATT compounds on specifically designed reporter luciferase constructs and, eventually, by showing their biological relevance using Notch signaling as a proof-of-principle substrate in cancer cells. Induction of a C-Terminal dominant negative version of Notch, lacking the intracellular signaling domain, should inhibit Notch signaling by engaging Notch ligands in non-productive interactions, and thus prevent its oncogenic functions. SWATT compounds will provide an additional tool to dissect the structure-function properties of proteins in their physiological contexts, and they wil constitute the basis for a novel therapeutic approach in the treatment of cancer and other diseases.",,Luca Cartegni,John R Knowlton,190139,190139,2014-05-07T12:05:00Z,2012-09-20T12:09:00Z,2015-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-12-002,nofo_RFA-CA-12-002,"RUTGERS, THE STATE UNIV OF N.J.",PISCATAWAY,nj,UNITED STATES,imat,org_state,False
7R21CA177395-03,R21CA177395,9188276,2015,A novel single-molecule telomere characterization technology for analyzing cancer,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Single-telomere-specific (TTAGGG)n tract lengths and instabilities cannot be measured globally using current methods; the ability to do so would be a major, transformative addition to the arsenal of tools for analyzing critical telomere loss an telomere elongation events in cancer. The shortest telomere or a small subset of the shortest telomeres in a cell will determine the onset of senescence, apoptosis, or genome instability; single (TTAGGG)n tracts are crucial for the function of telomeres and the biological effects of telomere attrition and dysfunction. Telomere loss, breakage, fusion, and rejoining are highly elevated in cancer, but current methods for detecting and measuring these mutational events at the molecular level are limited and low-throughput. The technology we propose to develop here would permit quantitative, single- allele-resolution measurements of telomere length and instability, enabling unprecedented insights into the role(s) telomere loss, telomere breakage/re-joining, and telomerase or ALT dependent telomere elongation play in carcinogenesis, including mechanistic insights into molecular events mediating these processes and translational insights for the potential prognostic and tumor stratification applicability of the methods. In this method, input genomic DNA is labeled with fluorescent dyes specific for (TTAGGG)n sequences and for linked subtelomeric DNA. The labeled individual DNA fragments are linearized (stretched) and imaged in the nano-channels of Bionano Genomics system at very high throughput. The lengths of the telomere are measured accurately and the distances between probes in the subtelomere region are determined accurately to infer the identity of the telomere. Our goals for this R21 study are to establish feasibility for (1) high-throughput single-molecule detection and quantitation of (TTAGGG)n tracts in genomic DNA samples and (2) subtelomere probe development and efficient co-labeling of telomeres and subtelomeres in the context of total genomic DNA, including conversion of the labeled DNA to double- stranded DNA suitable for nano-channel analysis; and (3) proof-of-principle results for the technology and its applicability for cancer research using data generated and analyzed for a normal and a cancer cell line. There are significant technical challenges inherent in this early-stage technology development project, but the extraordinary payoff for cancer research will be a high-throughput ability to probe mechanisms of telomere length regulation and telomere mutation at single-telomere resolution, in small (ultimately single-cell) samples of both dividing and non-dividing cells.",,Harold Riethman; Ming Xiao,Jerry Li,125192,125192,2016-01-21T12:01:00Z,2014-05-13T12:05:00Z,2017-04-30T12:04:00Z,RFA-CA-13-001,nofo_RFA-CA-13-001,OLD DOMINION UNIVERSITY,NORFOLK,va,UNITED STATES,imat,org_state,False
7R21CA193064-02,R21CA193064,9114273,2015,Cellular biofactories for therapeutic protein synthesis in tumor microenvironment,"﻿ DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): T cells undergo an intelligent decision-making process based on the inhibitory and excitatory chemotactic inputs; and extravagate to the tumor microenvironment through solid tissue barriers. Investigators' long-term goal, to be pursued in R33 phase, is to develop T cells into a platform vector technology for active drug- transport to the solid tumors. In this R21 application, their objective is to engineer a robust mechanism to transform autologous T cells into biofactories for autonomous synthesis of cytocidal secretory proteins upon stimulation by the tumor cells. Autonomous synthesis of Protein-of-Interest (PoI) with spatiotemporal resolution will enable targeting of tumor burden with cellular resolution and molecular specificity. Their central hypothesis is that T cells can be genetically encoded for robust modulation and biosynthesis of therapeutic proteins at the tumor site. They have chosen ovarian cancer that expresses Folate Receptor alpha (FRa) as disease model, and an apoptotic protein for its cytotoxic therapeutic value. However, the rationale for developing T cells as protein biofactories is that this is a platform technology and their specificity can be modified to target any cancer and autonomously synthesize any PoI in situ. To aid this R21 effort, they have developed cell lines expressing bioluminescent and fluorescent reporters expressed only when stimulated by tumor cells. With following specific aims, they will advance this project towards its goals: (1) To develop robust control on biosynthesis of protein-of-interest (PoI); (2) To develop T cells as biofactories for autonomous secretion of antitumor apoptotic protein. It is expected that this R21 phase will lead to T cells that will not activate in healthy tissues (enhanced safety) and hyperactivate specifically in the tumor microenvironment (enhanced efficacy). The impact of this research will also be felt on ongoing T-cell therapy trials by reducing the incidences of graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD). This pioneering approach builds upon ongoing T-cell immunotherapy trials, which are currently limited to control minimal residual disease (MRD) and is administered after chemotherapy. Proposed research is transformative, firstly because it will expand the scope of T-cell engineering to replace systemic chemotherapies. This will then be used for reduction of tumor burden rather than keeping MRD in check. Secondly, therapeutic proteins of non-human origin are efficiently degraded and removed by the immune system. This is a barrier to their in vivo application. The use of autologous T cells for biosynthesis of therapeutic proteins at the target site will eliminate any immunogenicity issues. Unusually high impact is expected because the specificity of T cells can be redirected towards the surface markers on different cancers and therefore be used to target multitude of cancers.",Address;Amidohydrolases;Anabolism;Antigen Targeting;Antigens;Apoptotic;Autologous;Cell Line;Cytoplasm;Decision Making;Development;Disease model;Drug Delivery Systems;Drug Transport;Engineering;Foundations;Future;Goals;IL6 gene;Immune system;Immunosuppressive Agents;Immunotherapy;In Situ;Incidence;Injection of therapeutic agent;Intercellular Fluid;Lead;Malignant Neoplasms;Malignant neoplasm of ovary;Mission;Molecular;Penicillin G;Permeability;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phase;Process;Prodrugs;Protein Biosynthesis;Proteins;Public Health;Regulation;Reporter;Reporting;Research;Research Personnel;Residual Neoplasm;Resolution;Response Elements;Safety;Site;Solid;Solid Neoplasm;Specificity;Surface;System;T cell response;T cell therapy;T-Cell Development;T-Cell Immunologic Specificity;T-Lymphocyte;Technology;Therapeutic;Therapy trial;Tissues;Transgenes;Tumor Antigens;Tumor Burden;Work;amidase;base;cellular engineering;chemotherapy;chimeric antigen receptor;cytotoxic;graft vs host disease;human FOLR1 protein;immunogenicity;in vivo;interest;nanoparticle;neoplastic cell;nuclear factors of activated T-cells;pressure;prevent;promoter;public health relevance;secretory protein;spatiotemporal;success;therapeutic protein;tumor;tumor microenvironment;tumor specificity;vector,Parijat Bhatnagar,Tawnya C Mckee,271339,271339,2015-08-12T12:08:00Z,2015-06-01T12:06:00Z,2018-05-31T12:05:00Z,RFA-CA-14-003,nofo_RFA-CA-14-003,SRI INTERNATIONAL,MENLO PARK,ca,UNITED STATES,imat,org_state,False
7R21CA196418-04,R21CA196418,9566479,2017,"Multiplexed, Quantitative Fluorescence Imaging in Tumor Sections","﻿ DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Precision medicine for cancer requires knowledge of the driver mutations in a particular patient's tumor. Recent single cell genetic studies have shown that driver mutations and cancer cell subtype are highly heterogeneous within a single patient. Thus, clinicians will need to employ experimental methods that allow observation of a variety of molecular analytes across many individual cells within a particular patient's tumor section in situ. Current tumor section analyses are not highly multiplexed and typically remain limited to ~4-5 analytes, or 7 with multi-spectral imaging. Recent technologies have pushed this number into 30s-60s, but they require expensive equipment and/or reagents, sophisticated analyses or markedly increased assay time, all of which would preclude their practical use in many clinical pathology and preclinical research laboratories. Thus, there remains a significant need for technologies that multiplex measurements in tumor sections but are widely accessible and cost-effective. We focus on addressing this need with a readily-adoptable but novel multi- spectral fluorescence-based method. It is based on the hypothesis that the power of combinatorics can be harnessed to vastly increase the number of quantifiable analytes in a mixture by permuting the wide array of available fluorophores in new ways. We term our approach combinatorial fluorescence with spectral imaging (CoFSI). CoFSI only requires the ability to perform multi-channel fluorescence excitation and emission spectral scanning, which is widely available and easy to implement in most plate/slide readers and many microscopes. Data analysis involves a straightforward, fast computational technique called linear unmixing. Preliminary simulation studies suggest that the concentrations of 123 different CoFSI probes constructed from 16 existing fluorescent proteins can be estimated simultaneously with good accuracy and precision across 3 orders of concentration magnitude with a large number of excitation channels, and 48 probes with 6 excitation channels. Similar simulation studies constrained by available tumor section imaging equipment and Alexa dyes suggest 25 simultaneous measurements are possible. Initial pilot experiments demonstrate that seven different CoFSI probe levels in a mixture can be measured both accurately and precisely using only the blue-yellow part of the spectrum. This proposal further tests the limits of CoFSI experimentally, and applies CoFSI to tumor section imaging, with two Aims: (1) Quantify the Levels of 48 Fluorescent Probes in a Mixture Simultaneously; and (2) Quantify the Spatial Distribution of 25 Analytes in Tumor Sections. If successful, CoFSI can increase quantitative fluorescence multiplexing at least ~5 to 10-fold while relying on standard lab resources and straightforward analyses. CoFSI is also feasibly compatible with other difficult-to-multiplex technologies such as high content screening, live-cell imaging, and in vivo rodent imaging, and thus may have broad impact.",Address;Adopted;Antibodies;Antigens;Architecture;Area;Basic Science;Biological Assay;Biological Markers;Biopsy Specimen;Breast Cancer cell line;Cells;Chemicals;Classification;Clinic;Clinical Data;Clinical Pathology;Combinatorics;Computational Technique;Cytometry;Data;Data Analyses;Diagnostic;Dyes;Epitopes;Equipment;Escherichia coli;Fluorescence;Fluorescent Probes;Genetic study;Image;In Situ;In Situ Hybridization;Individual;Knowledge;Label;Laboratory Research;Measurement;Measures;Methods;Microscope;Molecular;Mus;Nucleic Acids;Oncologist;Patients;Pharmacologic Substance;Principal Investigator;Proteins;Reader;Reagent;Research;Resolution;Resources;Rodent;Sample Size;Sampling;Scanning;Science;Slide;Spatial Distribution;Staining method;Stains;System;Techniques;Technology;Testing;Time;Tissues;Translating;Xenograft procedure;Yeasts;actionable mutation;base;cancer cell;cell type;clinical decision-making;clinically relevant;combinatorial;cost effective;data acquisition;deep sequencing;drug development;experimental study;fluorescence imaging;fluorophore;imaging modality;imaging probe;improved;in vivo;insight;live cell imaging;malignant breast neoplasm;novel;optical spectra;outcome forecast;pre-clinical;pre-clinical research;precision oncology;public health relevance;research and development;screening;simulation;spectrograph;treatment response;tumor;tumor heterogeneity;tumor microenvironment;tumor xenograft,Marc R.

7R21CA202831-04,R21CA202831,9753479,2018,Novel Bi-functional Inhibitors Blocking OncomiR Biogenesis,"﻿ DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this proposal is to develop a new class of selective miRNA regulators that blocks the maturation of oncomiRs. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate diverse biological processes. Dysregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) has become one of the emerging mechanisms contributes to cancer formation and progression. Increasing evidences suggest that certain miRNAs affect cellular transformation, carcinogenesis and metastasis, and act as oncogenes (oncogenic miRNAs or oncomiRs). Understanding the roles of oncomiRs in cancer will lead to the development of new cancer therapies. Besides, direct therapeutic intervention of oncomiRs has become a promising new direction for treating cancer. For both research and therapeutic purposes, methods allowing the control of oncomiR levels are highly desirable. Current methods for such purposes generally suffer from the off-target inhibition. To address this critical issue, we propose a novel strategy to regulate miRNA. We will develop a new class of bi-functional miRNA regulators consisting of independent and specialized ""pre-miRNA recognition unit"" and ""Dicer inhibition unit"" to target unique pre- miRNAs and block their processing to generate mature miRNAs by inhibiting Dicer enzymatic activity. The following Aims will accomplish our goal of establishing this new strategy: Aim 1. Synthesize and test bi- functional miRNA regulators. We will synthesize bi-functional regulators for miRNA-21 (miR-21) and other oncomiRs and test their inhibitory activity. Aim 2: Test the activity and specificity of the bi-functional miRNA regulator in cells. We will optimize cellular uptake of the regulator in mammalian cells. The cellular activity and off-target effects of the regulator will be evaluated in cells. This work will establish the technical foundation of a novel oncomiR regulation strategy. This unique technology will address the major obstacle encountered in current miRNA regulating methods and enhance the capability to dissect the roles of oncomiRs in cancer biology. It will significantly contribute to the advancement in our knowledge of the role played by oncomiRs in cancer and will result in the development of novel cancer therapies either directly based on the bi- modular regulators or evolved from the understanding of oncomiR functions unveiled by this new technology.",Address;Adverse effects;Affect;Affinity;Antisense Oligonucleotides;Binding;Biogenesis;Biological Assay;Biological Process;Cancer Biology;Cell physiology;Cells;Development;Dicer Enzyme;Foundations;Generations;Goals;In Vitro;Knowledge;Link;Malignant Neoplasms;Mammalian Cell;Messenger RNA;Methods;MicroRNAs;Neoplasm Metastasis;Northern Blotting;Oncogenes;Oncogenic;Pathogenesis;Play;Proteins;Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR;RNA;Regulation;Research;Role;Specificity;Technology;Testing;Therapeutic;Therapeutic Intervention;Untranslated RNA;Western Blotting;Work;base;cancer therapy;cancer type;carcinogenesis;design;improved;inhibitor/antagonist;interest;metaplastic cell transformation;new technology;next generation;novel;novel strategies;novel therapeutics;public health relevance;research and development;ribosome profiling;transcriptome sequencing;uptake,Fu-Sen Liang,Jennifer A.

7R21CA229044-03,R21CA229044,10253467,2020,Novel Platform linking cancer-specific glycosylation with cell signaling outcomes,ABSTRACT Abnormal glycosylation is a hallmark of many cancers that contributes to tumor growth and invasion. There are many protein receptors that are regulated abnormally in cancer due to mutations and/or alterations in glycosylation. Studies to link specific glycosylation changes to signaling outcomes have primarily focused on studies of individual receptors or specific pathways. Methods that can link forms of tumor-specific glycosylation to global effects on signaling pathway activation are needed to better identify potential new targets for therapeutics. To overcome this limitation we are employing the use of heterobifunctional molecule that will link cancer-specific glycosylation on protein receptors with a proximity- induced ubiquitination. To demonstrate the potential and applicability of this method we are using a novel scFv antibody that recognizes tumor-specific glycans present on ovarian cancer and glioblastoma cells that has been demonstrated to have excellent cell permeability. Combining the scFv with proteolysis targeting molecules will enable us to identify receptors and signaling changes using mass spectrometry methods. Successful completion of this project will establish a new platform useful for both basic science research and clinical therapeutic development.,Address;Animal Model;Antibodies;Area;Basic Science;Binding;Cancer Control;Cell Line;Cell Surface Proteins;Cell surface;Cells;Chimera organism;Clinical;Development;Evolution;Feasibility Studies;Future;Glioblastoma;Global Change;Glycoproteins;Goals;Growth;HIF1A gene;Human;In Vitro;Incubated;Individual;Knowledge;Ligands;Link;Longevity;Malignant - descriptor;Malignant Neoplasms;Malignant neoplasm of ovary;Maps;Mass Spectrum Analysis;Mediating;Membrane Proteins;Methods;Mutation;Outcome;Output;Pathway interactions;Peptide Hydrolases;Permeability;Polysaccharides;Post-Translational Protein Processing;Protein Glycosylation;Proteins;Proteolysis;Receptor Signaling;Research;Research Personnel;Research Proposals;Scientist;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;Specificity;Stains;Structure;Testing;Therapeutic;Tumor Cell Invasion;Tumor Tissue;Ubiquitin;Ubiquitination;Xenograft Model;cancer cell;cancer therapy;chimeric antibody;clinical application;clinical implementation;glycosylation;improved;in vivo;innovation;intraperitoneal;method development;migration;mutant;new therapeutic target;novel;receptor;small hairpin RNA;subcutaneous;sugar;therapeutic development;tool;tumor;tumor growth;tumor xenograft;tumorigenesis,Karen L.

This technology will be based on a spatially-arrayed aptamer microchip and sensitive fluorescence-based optical detection techniques. The system will provide a powerful new tool for biomedical research and diagnosis of diseases and cancers. Currently, the levels of cellular proteins are inferred from cellular mRNA levels by using DNA oligonucleotide microchips. These microchips allow the detection of mRNA levels by base-pairing interactions to homologous DNA oligomers located at different sites in the microchip array. However, this indirect assay of protein levels suffers from two problems: First, mRNA levels may not accurately reflect the level of encoded protein because translation and degradation rates vary from protein to protein and are regulated in response to cell physiology. Second, post-translational modifications proteins often alter critical protein activities. This technology we propose to develop is comprised of three parts: 1) Aptamers with high-affinity and high-specifity for individual proteins. These aptamers will be designed to have ligand-dependent changes in fluorescence properties. 2) A microchip array with each array site occupied by aptamers against a different target molecule. 3) An evanescent field fluorescence detector which detects target molecules binding to aptamers at the array sites. Our proposal includes plans for: 1) selection of aptamers that can discriminate between different post-translational modifications of the same protein; 2) development of fluorescence-based techniques for detecting oligonucleotide:protein interactions; 3) design and construction of an optimized fluorescence detector; 4) scaling up methods to allow large numbers of independent aptamer selections against different proteins; 5) construction of a prototype protein chip.",macromolecule; messenger RNA; microprocessor /microchip; oligonucleotides; posttranslational modifications; proteins; technology /technique development,Andrew D Ellington,John R Knowlton,678625,678625,2004-06-25T12:06:00Z,2003-06-01T12:06:00Z,2007-05-31T12:05:00Z,PAR-99-100,nofo_PAR-99-100,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN,AUSTIN,tx,UNITED STATES,imat,org_state,False
7R33CA088343-05,R33CA088343,6800243,2003,FLUORESCENT TAGS TARGETED ON CELL SURFACE CARBOHYDRATES,"Malignant transformation is often associated with alteration of cell surface carbohydrates. The expression or over-expression of certain carbohydrates, such as sialyl Lewis X (sLex), sialyl Lewis a (sLea), Lewis X (Lex) and Lewis Y (Ley), has been correlated with the development of certain cancers. These cell surface carbohydrates can be used for cell-specific identification and targeting of carcinoma cells. The long-term goal of this project is the development of small molecule artificial receptors which can recognize target carbohydrate structures with high selectivity and affinity. Such receptors could be used for the development of fluorescent tags for cell- specific identification, tissue-specific imaging (such as MRI), and targeted delivery of therapeutic agents. In this study, we will use sLex as the model carbohydrate and use colon cancer as the model biological system because the expression of sLex is often associated with progression and metastasis of colon cancer. The short-term objective of this application is to develop tissue-specific fluorescent tags (sensors) which can recognize sLex with high affinity and selectivity. For the construction of such fluorescent sensors, we plan to use an integrated approach combining template-directed synthesis, combinatorial chemistry, and computer molecular modeling aided design. The sLex-specific artificial receptors have the potential to be used for cell identification, detection and tagging for the purpose of localization, staging, tissue biopsy, and fluorescence-directed surgical removal of colon cancer cells. Such tissue-specific compounds could also serve as vehicles for targeted delivery of cancer chemotherapeutic agents. These small molecule sensors may also have the following advantages over antibody-based detection/delivery systems: (1) greater stability during storage and in vivo; (2) increased permeability through biological membranes and, therefore, enhanced target accessibility; (3) intrinsic sensitivity to binding with significant fluorescence intensity increases, making detection and visualization easier and more suitable for high throughout screening, and (4) lower propensity to elicit undesirable immune responses. Similar methods, once developed, could also be used for the construction of fluorescent tags for other cell surface carbohydrates implicated in human malignancies.",carbohydrates; chemical models; colon neoplasms; combinatorial chemistry; computer simulation; drug design /synthesis /production; fluorescent dye /probe; surface antigens; tissue /cell culture,Binghe Wang,John R Knowlton,288000,288000,2003-09-15T12:09:00Z,2000-07-01T12:07:00Z,2005-06-30T12:06:00Z,PAR-99-100,nofo_PAR-99-100,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,ATLANTA,ga,UNITED STATES,imat,org_state,False

The proposed project involves collaboration between members of Northwestern's Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center, including researchers in Chemical Engineering, the Medical School, and Evanston Hospital. Microchannel ""tandem"" SSCP/HA is a novel mutation detection method recently developed in our laboratory, which involves the simultaneous generation and analysis of homo/heteroduplex DNA and SSCP conformers. Studies of a significant number of samples (32) indicate that tandem SSCP/HA allows for much higher-sensitivity mutation detection (100%) than SSCP alone (93%) or HA alone (75%), for p53 samples. We have developed and published optimized sample preparation protocols, gel formulations, and analysis conditions for capillary array electrophoresis (CAE). During the R21 phase, we will translate these methods to microfluidic electrophoresis chips, which offer a large increase in throughput and drop in cost of DNA analysis compared to CAE. The p53 gene, known to be mutated in >50% of human cancers, and whose mutation status can be predictive of patient response to chemotherapy, is the important model system chosen. However, microchip-based genetic analysis technologies to be developed should be easily applied to ANY cancer-related gene. In the R21 phase, we will analyze approximately 60 different DNA samples derived from tumor cell lines, representing a range of mutations in different p53 exons, to determine the impact of DNA sample characteristics and electrophoresis protocols on the sensitivity and specificity of the method, in a blinded study designed by collaborating biostatisticians. When optimized tandem SSCP/HA protocols have been developed for microchips, they will be piloted by the analysis of >200 selected samples amplified from frozen, solid tumors banked at Evanston Hospital. Via this blinded study, sensitivity and specificity (both expected to be at or near 100%) will be determined and reported for the first time using banked tumor tissue, providing necessary validation for clinical application of this technique, and making rapid, low-cost cancer genotyping technology widely available to physicians.",Address;Admixture;Affect;Age;Biological;Biological Assay;Biological Models;Blinded;Blood capillaries;Cancer Detection;Cancer Patient;Cancer cell line;Capillary Electrophoresis;Characteristics;Chemical Engineering;Clinical;Collaborations;Comprehensive Cancer Center;Condition;Cost Analysis;DNA;DNA Fingerprinting;DNA Sequence;DNA Sequence Alteration;DNA analysis;Data;Detection;Devices;Disease-Free Survival;Drops;Drug Formulations;Economics;Effectiveness;Electrophoresis;Elements;Ensure;Evaluation;Exons;Fluorescence;Freezing;Funding;Gel;Generations;Genes;Genomics;Glass;Heteroduplex Analysis;Homo;Hospitals;Human;Hybridization Array;Immunohistochemistry;Individual;Laboratories;Lasers;Length;Link;Malignant Neoplasms;Mammary Neoplasms;Medical;Methodology;Methods;Microchip Electrophoresis;Microfluidic Microchips;Microfluidics;Migration Assay;Molecular;Mutate;Mutation;Mutation Detection;Negative Axillary Lymph Node;Neoplasm Metastasis;Normal Cell;Numbers;Outcome;Patients;Pattern;Phase;Physicians;Plastics;Polymers;Positive Lymph Node;Preparation;Primary Neoplasm;Probability;Process;Protein p53;Protocols documentation;Publishing;Range;Rate;Recurrence;Reporting;Research Design;Research Personnel;Running;Sampling;Screening procedure;Sensitivity and Specificity;Series;Single-Stranded Conformational Polymorphism;Single-Stranded DNA;Solid Neoplasm;Specimen;Staining method;Stains;Standards of Weights and Measures;Statistically Significant;TP53 gene;Techniques;Technology;Temperature;Tissue Sample;Translating;Tube;Tumor Bank;Tumor Cell Line;Tumor Suppressor Genes;Tumor Tissue;Tumor-Derived;Validation;Work;anticancer research;base;blind;cancer therapy;capillary;chemotherapy;clinical application;clinically relevant;conformer;cost;design;ds-DNA;electric field;genetic analysis;genotyping technology;innovative technologies;interest;malignant breast neoplasm;medical schools;member;micro-total analysis system;microchip;migration;mutant;novel;outcome forecast;response;success;time use;tumor,Annelise Emily Barron,Avraham Rasooly,173000,173000,2007-12-14T12:12:00Z,2007-12-14T12:12:00Z,2009-05-31T12:05:00Z,PAR-01-106,nofo_PAR-01-106,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,STANFORD,ca,UNITED STATES,imat,org_state,False
7R33CA105295-03,R33CA105295,7141498,2005,Ovarian Cancer Screening Using Comprehensive Proteomics,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The development of biomarkers for earlier detection of ovarian cancer will greatly improve survival. Most women present with advanced stage disease with survival rates of roughly 20%. Advances in the field of proteomics now provide the tools necessary to effectively analyze the serum proteome, and the application of such technologies holds great promise for determining novel biomarkers. This proposal outlines methods to comprehensively discover, identify, quantify, and validate a panel of specific and sensitive ovarian cancer biomarkers for early detection. We propose the following Specific Aims: 1. Determine candidate ovarian cancer biomarkers defined by comprehensive biomarker analysis of serum. Emphasis will be placed on refining the most effective overall analytical strategy for comprehensive and reproducible measurements. Spectral peaks that most accurately distinguish cancer vs. control will be identified using high-resolving power technology. Biostatistics and bioinformatics will be used to prioritize candidate markers (according to specificity, sensitivity and predictive value) for further characterization. 2. Identification and absolute quantification of the candidate biomarkers. This will improve reliability and high-throughput capabilities in subsequent validation testing, and the identification of these proteins will contribute further to research into the biologic basis of the disease. We will use accurate mass measurements, tandem mass spectrometry, and non-redundant protein and genome databases applied to distinct selected controls. Furthermore, we will determine the range of values for both normal and cancer serum samples using stable isotope labeled internal standards. 3. Clinical validation of a panel of biomarkers in specific groups of women. Sera from defined cohorts of women will be used to accurately determine the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of individual and combinations of candidate markers in all aspects of disease (early/late stage, familial, remission and recurrence) and in large numbers of non-cancer controls.",biomarker;clinical research;early diagnosis;female;high throughput technology;human middle age (35-64);human old age (65+);human subject;interview;mass spectrometry;menopause;neoplasm /cancer classification /staging;neoplasm /cancer diagnosis;neoplasm /cancer epidemiology;neoplasm /cancer relapse /recurrence;ovary neoplasms;protein quantitation /detection;proteomics;serum;stable isotope;women&apos;s health,David C.

7R33CA105514-04,R33CA105514,7271419,2007,Assaying Tyrosine Kinase Activity: A New Paradigm,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): New approaches are needed in the molecular analyses of the growth-promoting signal transduction pathways involved in the development and maintenance of cancer. The Laser Micropipet System (LMS), a new technology for the biochemical assay of kinases, holds the promise of directly assaying the activities of protein tyrosine kinases in primary patient cells. The LMS was developed for the assay of serine/threonine kinases in individual cells grown in tissue culture. This R21/R33 application proposes to expand the applications of this instrumentation to directly determine the activity of oncogenic tyrosine kinases in primary cells from patients. Assay of Bcr-Abl in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) will demonstrate the power of this tool for research, clinical, and pharmacologic applications. While this assay will be of value in the study of the biology and resistance mechanisms in CML, the studies will lay the groundwork for a new paradigm in the study of molecular mechanisms in cancer signal transduction and will have general applicability. The R21 phase of this proposal is designed to establish the feasibility of assaying Bcr-Abl activity and to demonstrate the necessary assay conditions for measurements in cells derived from a patient with CML. The specific aims are to: 1) identify and characterize a reporter of intracellular Bcr-Ab1 kinase activity, 2) define and optimize conditions for measuring Bcr-Ab1 activity in human cells, 3) compare reporter phosphorylation in cells expressing Bcr-Ab1 vs. cells lacking this kinase, and 4) demonstrate the feasibility of using primary patient cells in kinase assays. The goal of the R33 phase is to demonstrate the potential for the LMS-based kinase assay in applications for the study of the biology of pharmacologic resistance in CML, including from primary patient cells. The R33 specific aims are to: 1) develop a membrane-permeant Bcr-Ab1 kinase reporter, 2) demonstrate the ability to detect imatinib resistance in CML cell lines, 3) determine Bcr-Ab1 activity in primary cells from patients with CML and their response to pharmacologic inhibition, and 4) determine if the assay can detect the emergence of imatinib resistance in CML patients and can differentiate the mechanisms of drug resistance.",Biochemical;Biological Assay;Biology;Cell Line;Cells;Chronic Myeloid Leukemia;Clinical;Condition;Development;Drug resistance;Goals;Growth;Human;Imatinib;Individual;Lasers;Maintenance;Malignant Neoplasms;Measurement;Measures;Membrane;Molecular;Oncogenic;Patients;Phase;Phosphorylation;Phosphotransferases;Protein Tyrosine Kinase;Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases;Reporter;Research;Resistance;Signal Transduction;Signal Transduction Pathway;System;base;design;instrumentation;new technology;novel strategies;resistance mechanism;response;tissue culture;tool,Christopher E Sims,Min-Kyung H Song,310218,310218,2007-07-23T12:07:00Z,2005-08-08T12:08:00Z,2009-07-31T12:07:00Z,PAR-01-106,nofo_PAR-01-106,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,CHAPEL HILL,nc,UNITED STATES,imat,org_state,False
7R33CA107943-05,R33CA107943,7755719,2008,A Novel Proteomics Technology for Protein Farnesylation,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The identification and characterization of changes in the level of farnesylated proteins in response to the treatment of farnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTIs), a newly introduced family of antitumor agents currently undergoing clinical evaluation, represents a major scientific challenge. Extant proteomics methods are limited to quantifying a few thousands of the most abundant proteins and, therefore, are unsuitable for the targeted profiling of less abundant farnesylated expression. The major goal of this application is to develop and validate a powerful technology, Tagging via Azido Substrate (TAS), for the efficient isolation of farnesylated proteins. This technology will then be applied to the proteomics analysis of farnesylated proteins in physiologically relevant models. The TAS technology involves the introduction of a synthetic azide-modified farnesyl substrate, either farnesyl azide diphosphate (FPP-azide) or farnesyl azide alcohol (F-azide-OH), which replaces the natural substrate during cellular protein farnesylation. The resulting farnesyl-azide (F-azide)-modified proteins will be affinity-purified through an azide-specific conjugation reaction (Staudinger reaction) using a phosphine capture reagent linked to photo-cleavable beads, which can then be released by UV light-induced photo-cleavage. Since affinity purification relies on covalent bonding resulting from a specific conjugation reaction between an azide and phosphine capture reagent, other proteins without the F-azide modification can be effectively removed by thorough washing. Thus, the TAS technology will allow farnesylated proteins to be isolated with high yield, high specificity, and low contamination. The initial focus of the R21 portion of this proposal is on the development of TAS technology and its application to the isolation of farnesylated proteins. These studies will be extended subsequently to geranylgeranylated proteins. The R33 proposal will aim at applications of the TAS technology to the identification of novel FTI targets. These studies will provide fundamental information for the understanding of molecular mechanisms of FTI functions and are likely to identify novel targets for antitumor drug design.",Affinity;Affinity Chromatography;Alcohols;Azides;Development;Diphosphates;Drug Design;Family;Farnesyl Transferase Inhibitor;Goals;Link;Methods;Modeling;Modification;Molecular;Phosphines;Protein Farnesylation;Proteins;Proteomics;Reaction;Reagent;Specificity;Technology;antitumor agent;antitumor drug;covalent bond;novel;phosphine;research clinical testing;response,Yingming Zhao,John R Knowlton,461899,461899,2009-01-16T12:01:00Z,2004-06-07T12:06:00Z,2010-03-31T12:03:00Z,PAR-01-104,nofo_PAR-01-104,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,CHICAGO,il,UNITED STATES,imat,org_state,False
7R33CA114149-04,R33CA114149,7455761,2008,Imaging tumor associated fibroblast activation protein,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this research is to develop a novel fibroblast activation protein (FAP) sensing near infrared fluorescence reporter for early tumor detection and tumor classification. FAP is a cell surface antigen of reactive tumor stromal fibroblasts founded in more than 90% of epithelial carcinomas, but it is absent from epithelial carcinoma cells, normal fibroblasts, and other normal human tissue. Supporting tumor stromal fibroblasts are generally localized close to tumor vasculature, which is essential for early tumor development and growth. Thus it has been chosen as a target for monoclonal antibody based tumor therapy. FAP is not only a membrane protein but also a dipeptidyl peptidase. An imaging probe to report enzymatic activity and location of FAP could be extremely useful for early tumor detection. In this application we will develop a small molecular probe with ultra-sensitivity based on a unique class of fluorogenic chromophore that has significant changes in emission at different chemical states. Specifically, the probes emit no fluorescence in their initial intact state but become brightly fluorescent after specific proteolytic reaction. The newly developed low molecular weight, well defined fluorogenic probes are expected to have several advantages for imaging: a) fast tissue distribution allowing earlier imaging after injection, b) fast clearance allowing repeated imaging, and c) high likelihood of developing key candidates into clinically useful agents. The choice of FAP is based on its importance in tumor growth, invasion, and other processes in oncogenesis. Together with recent developments in fluorescence imaging technologies, this research is expected to ultimately result in clinical imaging agents with specificity for targeted enzymes. We believe that the developed approach can be used as a platform to design a broad spectrum of activatable molecular probes to image other amino peptidases in vivo.",Carcinoma;Chemicals;Class;Classification;Clinical;Detection;Development;Dipeptidyl Peptidases;Drug or chemical Tissue Distribution;Enzymes;Fibroblasts;Fluorescence;Goals;Growth and Development function;Image;Imaging technology;Injection of therapeutic agent;Localized;Location;Malignant Epithelial Cell;Membrane Proteins;Molecular Probes;Molecular Weight;Monoclonal Antibodies;Peptide Hydrolases;Process;Reaction;Reporter;Reporting;Research;Specificity;Stromal Neoplasm;Surface Antigens;base;chromophore;design;fibroblast-activating factor;fluorescence imaging;human tissue;imaging probe;in vivo;novel;tumor;tumor growth;tumorigenesis,Ching-Hsuan Tung,James W.

However, their widespread use is limited by a number of difficulties in manufacturing such cells. Current manufacturing processes are complicated, costly, and can only produce cells for small populations. Additionally, they have large production variations. As a result, different patients receive very different products or treatments. The long-term goal is to develop a novel technology to address the CAR T manufacturing challenge. Toward this goal, the team has developed a proof- of-concept technology termed stress-free intra-tubular cell culture technology (SFIT). SFIT provides cells uniform, highly reproducible, controllable, and cell-friendly microenvironments, resulting in extremely high culture efficiency and consistency. SFIT produces cells for each patient with one small conical tube, significantly reducing production cost and increasing production capability. The purpose of this project is to further develop and validate this technology and the associated methods to make it ready for the final translational challenge. Leveraging sound preliminary studies and a diverse team of experts, the specific aims are to (1) validate SFIT for culturing T cells from a wide range of donors and for culturing various T cell subtypes, (2) further develop and validate methods for transducing T cells with lentivirus and γ-retrovirus in SFIT, and (3) further develop and validate the SFIT-based single-conical-tube-device for producing autologous CAR T cells. The project will build on the team’s strong preliminary work and include mathematical modeling, prototype device design, extensive T cell culturing, exome-Seq and RNA-Seq data analyses, in vivo testing, statistical analyses and comparisons, and partnership with ADS BIOTEC, a company that designs, builds, and sells instruments for processing human cells. With the completion of this project, simple, disposable, affordable devices for the scalable, cost-effective and consistent production of autologous CAR T cells are expected. This technology can also be scaled up for producing allogeneic CAR T cells in large scales if needed. This technology will not only make CAR T cells broadly accessible, but also make the product much more consistent and predictable. Based on 2012-2014 data, approximately 38.5% of the human population will be diagnosed with some type of cancer during their lifetime. Currently, only about 67% of cancer patients will survive five years after diagnosis. CAR T cell therapy is expected to significantly increase their chances of survival. The technology developed in this proposal will make CAR T cells available to many patients.",3-Dimensional;Address;Adopted;Alginates;Allogenic;Autologous;B lymphoid malignancy;CAR T cell therapy;Caliber;Cancer Patient;Cell Aggregation;Cell Culture Techniques;Cell Death;Cells;Clinical Research;Cultured Cells;Data;Data Analyses;Development;Device Designs;Devices;Diagnosis;Diffusion;Disease;Dose;Ensure;Environmental Risk Factor;Gammaretrovirus;Genetic;Genetic Engineering;Geometry;Goals;Human;Hydrogels;Lentivirus;Malignant Neoplasms;Methods;Outcome;Patients;Population;Process;Production;Protocols documentation;Quality of life;Radial;Reproducibility;Solid Neoplasm;Statistical Data Interpretation;Stress;Suspension Culture;T-Lymphocyte;Technology;Time;Translations;Treatment Cost;Tube;Tubular formation;Variant;Virus;Work;base;cancer therapy;cancer type;cell growth;chimeric antigen receptor;chimeric antigen receptor T cells;clinically relevant;cost;cost effective;design;exome sequencing;improved;in vivo;in vivo evaluation;instrument;manufacturing process;mathematical model;new technology;novel;operation;preclinical study;prototype;scale up;shear stress;sound;success;therapy development;transcriptome sequencing;transduction efficiency;tumor,Yuguo Lei,Lokesh Agrawal,356057,356057,2021-04-22T12:04:00Z,2019-03-19T12:03:00Z,2023-02-28T12:02:00Z,RFA-CA-18-005,nofo_RFA-CA-18-005,"PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY, THE",UNIVERSITY PARK,pa,UNITED STATES,imat,org_state,False

To reach AYA survivors, their desire for peer connections, almost ubiquitous use of smartphones and social media, and strong preferences to exercise in their homes and communities and as part of social activity must be leveraged. The intervention must also be accessible and affordable for patients without private health insurance as they are less likely to receive survivorship care and more likely to have greater morbidity. The transdisciplinary study team has completed two recent pilot studies among AYA survivors that provide substantial scientific premise for the proposed research by demonstrating that the intervention is feasible, has high rates of uptake and adherence, and appears promising for increasing PA. The proposed multi-site, randomized controlled trial (RCT) will enroll 384 AYA survivors currently ages 15.0- 20.9 years who are 3-36 months off therapy and not meeting PA guidelines. The 12-month trial will test the efficacy of a 6-month intensive multi-level PA intervention combining a wearable Fitbit PA tracker (intrapersonal level) with integration of activity data leading to individualized goal setting by text (intrapersonal level) and a private Instagram account serving as a virtual peer support group of survivors (interpersonal and community level) followed by a 6-month maintenance phase to improve PA in AYA survivors. Given the ubiquity of PA tracking devices and apps, the control group will receive the Fitbit only without integration of Fitbit data in other activities. A nationwide sample of patients drawn from rural, urban, community, and academic centers will be recruited using the Children’s Oncology Group consortium of >200 hospitals. This rigorously designed, multi-site RCT will test the efficacy of the mobile health (mHealth) behavioral intervention, compared to the control group, to achieve the following Specific Aims among AYA survivors over 12 months: Aim 1 - To increase PA; Aim 2 - To improve biomarkers predictive of cardiometabolic health; and Aim 3 - To improve health-related quality of life. Analyses of hypothesized mediation factors for Aims 1-3 and post-trial qualitative interviews among participants with and without private health insurance will provide explanatory knowledge to help refine intervention procedures and tailor the intervention for future RCTs among patient subgroups who will most benefit.

5U01CA246665-05,U01CA246665,10706322,2023,A Randomized Trial of a Mobile Health and Social Media Physical Activity Intervention Among Adolescent and Young Adult Childhood Cancer Survivors,"PROJECT SUMMARY Interventions to increase physical activity (PA) are vitally needed in adolescent and young adult childhood cancer survivors (AYA survivors) who are largely inactive but are at lifelong elevated risk of cardiomyopathy, insulin resistance, and other cardiometabolic disorders. To reach AYA survivors, their desire for peer connections, almost ubiquitous use of smartphones and social media, and strong preferences to exercise in their homes and communities and as part of social activity must be leveraged. The intervention must also be accessible and affordable for patients without private health insurance as they are less likely to receive survivorship care and more likely to have greater morbidity. The transdisciplinary study team has completed two recent pilot studies among AYA survivors that provide substantial scientific premise for the proposed research by demonstrating that the intervention is feasible, has high rates of uptake and adherence, and appears promising for increasing PA. The proposed multi-site, randomized controlled trial (RCT) will enroll 384 AYA survivors currently ages 15.0- 20.9 years who are 3-36 months off therapy and not meeting PA guidelines. The 12-month trial will test the efficacy of a 6-month intensive multi-level PA intervention combining a wearable Fitbit PA tracker (intrapersonal level) with integration of activity data leading to individualized goal setting by text (intrapersonal level) and a private Instagram account serving as a virtual peer support group of survivors (interpersonal and community level) followed by a 6-month maintenance phase to improve PA in AYA survivors. Given the ubiquity of PA tracking devices and apps, the control group will receive the Fitbit only without integration of Fitbit data in other activities. A nationwide sample of patients drawn from rural, urban, community, and academic centers will be recruited using the Children’s Oncology Group consortium of >200 hospitals. This rigorously designed, multi-site RCT will test the efficacy of the mobile health (mHealth) behavioral intervention, compared to the control group, to achieve the following Specific Aims among AYA survivors over 12 months: Aim 1 - To increase PA; Aim 2 - To improve biomarkers predictive of cardiometabolic health; and Aim 3 - To improve health-related quality of life. Analyses of hypothesized mediation factors for Aims 1-3 and post-trial qualitative interviews among participants with and without private health insurance will provide explanatory knowledge to help refine intervention procedures and tailor the intervention for future RCTs among patient subgroups who will most benefit. If shown to be efficacious, this mHealth intervention to improve PA in AYA survivors is highly scalable because smartphones and social media are widespread, PA trackers are popular and affordable, goal setting can be automated, and social media activities do not require specialized staff.","Accelerometer;Adherence;Adolescent and Young Adult;Aftercare;Age;Behavior Therapy;Biological Assay;Biological Markers;Blood;Cancer Burden;Cardiometabolic Disease;Cardiomyopathies;Cardiopulmonary;Caring;Cellular Phone;Chronic;Communities;Competence;Control Groups;Data;Devices;Dyslipidemias;Enrollment;Evaluation;Exercise;Fasting;Fatigue;Future;Goals;Guidelines;Health;Health Insurance;Health behavior;Health education;Heart Rate;Home;Hospitals;Inflammatory;Instagram;Insulin Resistance;Insurance;Intervention;Interview;Knowledge;Lipids;Maintenance;Mediating;Mediation;Modeling;Morbidity - disease rate;Obesity;Participant;Patient Self-Report;Patients;Pediatric Oncology Group;Phase;Physical Function;Physical activity;Physiological;Pilot Projects;Population;Privatization;Procedures;Quality of life;Randomized;Randomized, Controlled Trials;Research;Rest;Risk;Rural;Sampling;Site;Social Functioning;Support Groups;Survivors;Text;Treatment Efficacy;adipokines;behavioral health intervention;cancer therapy;cardiometabolic risk;cardiometabolism;cardiovascular health;childhood cancer survivor;comparison control;cost;design;disparity reduction;efficacy evaluation;efficacy testing;exercise intervention;fitbit;fitness;glucose metabolism;health disparity;health related quality of life;heart rate monitor;improved;indexing;instrument;intervention participants;intervention refinement;mHealth;medical specialties;patient subsets;peer;peer support;personalized approach;physical inactivity;portability;predictive marker;preference;primary outcome;psychologic;randomized trial;recruit;secondary outcome;sedentary;social;social media;survivorship;tool;uptake;virtual",Nina S Kadan-Lottick; Jason A Mendoza,David Worth Dean,541058,541058,2023-08-15T12:08:00Z,2019-09-19T12:09:00Z,2025-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-19-033,nofo_RFA-CA-19-033,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,WASHINGTON,dc,UNITED STATES,improving_outcomes_for_pediatric_adolescent_and_young_adult_cancer_survivors,org_state,False

Existing query engines allow researchers to explore clinical data, build queries, and execute queries without the need for the user to understand how the data is stored. However, the interfaces of such query engines have not achieved usability approaching the levels of those for consumer websites due in critical part to the lack of faceted capabilities. Faceted systems for querying clinical data is currently unavailable due to the complexity of data and the mismatch between the ontologies used for organizing and annotating clinical data (such as NCI Thesaurus), and the desired facet structures and properties. We propose to overcome these challenges by developing OncoSphere, a query engine using the NCI Thesaurus as a nested facet system (NFS) to provide web-based exploration of the Kentucky Cancer Registry data using 3 Specific Aims. In Aim 1 we will develop an approach to transform and implement NCI Thesaurus into an NFS to enable OncoSphere’s interface features. In Aim 2 we will develop methods to perform quality auditing on the hierarchical structure of the NCI Thesaurus to enhance its quality in supporting faceted query for OncoSphere. In Aim 3 we will perform evaluation on OncoSphere’s query expressiveness, query performance and conduct preliminary usability assessment. OncoSphere will break new ground in web-based tools and capitalize on available data resources to accelerate cancer research. We expect OncoSphere and its future versions to become an invaluable resource for the cancer research community.

Genomics holds promise for improving classification and prognostication of malignancies, yet oncology practice continues to rely heavily on immunohistochemistry (IHC) as a fundamental tool due to its practicality and ability to provide protein-level and subcellular localization information. The goal of this proposal is to create an open-source software resource for the quantitative analysis of IHC stained tissues and effective integration of IHC, genomic, and clinical features for cancer classification and prognostication. This proposal builds on our collective experience in computer-assisted analysis of microscopic images (including IHC images), development of machine-learning methods to address the challenges of classification and prognostication with heterogeneous and high-dimensional data, and leadership in collection and large-scale analysis of cancer outcomes involving collaboration with multiple medical centers. This effort for the first time will create tools to integrate quantitative IHC imaging, clinical, and genomic information that will in turn enable the research community to explore strategies for the classification of malignancies and prediction of outcomes. The proposed tools will be developed and extensively validated in close collaboration with clinical, genomic, and digital pathology data from the NCI-supported Lymphoma Epidemiology of Outcomes (LEO) cohort study. The software tools produced by this proposal will enable the characterization of subcellular protein expression in cell nuclei, membranes and cytoplasmic compartments. Spatial features of protein expression heterogeneity, along with patient-level summaries of protein expression will be used to develop machine-learning classifiers for cancer subtypes, using diffuse large b-cell lymphomas as a driving application. Technology for automatic tuning of machine learning algorithms will enable a broad class of clinically and biologically motivated users to utilize these tools in their investigations. We will also provide an interactive dashboard that enables users to integrate genomic and IHC-based features to explore prognostic models of patient survival.

In Aim 3 we will perform evaluation on OncoSphere’s query expressiveness, query performance and conduct preliminary usability assessment. OncoSphere will break new ground in web-based tools and capitalize on available data resources to accelerate cancer research. We expect OncoSphere and its future versions to become an invaluable resource for the cancer research community. The long-term goal of this study is to create data exploration systems for NCI’s Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program and other related cancer data resources through data science innovations to transform user experience with a new generation of data interaction modalities.",Address;Adopted;Area;Biomedical Research;Characteristics;Clinical Data;Clinical Research;Clinical Trials;Communities;Computer software;Data;Data Science;Databases;Detection;Development;Ensure;Evaluation;Future;Generations;Goals;Kentucky;Knowledge;Lead;Malignant Neoplasms;Metadata;Methods;Modality;NCI Thesaurus;Online Systems;Ontology;Patients;Performance;Privacy;Property;Research Personnel;Resources;Role;SEER Program;Site;Software Tools;Structure;System;Terminology;Time;Translations;Trees;Work;anticancer research;data access;data integration;data management;data registry;data resource;design;experience;human data;improved;innovation;insight;lexical;neoplasm registry;neoplasm resource;novel;query optimization;sound;success;tool;usability;web app;web site;web-based tool,Licong Cui; Guo-Qiang Zhang,Angela B Mariotto,162452,162452,2019-07-04T12:07:00Z,2018-06-06T12:06:00Z,2021-07-31T12:07:00Z,PAR-15-334,nofo_PAR-15-334,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,HOUSTON,tx,UNITED STATES,itcr,org_state,False
7U01CA220401-03,U01CA220401,10070213,2019,Informatics Tools for Quantitative Digital Pathology Profiling and Integrated Prognostic Modeling,"PROJECT SUMMARY Accurate biomarker-driven prognostic stratification, response prediction, and cohort enrichment are critical for realizing precision treatment strategies and population health management approaches that optimize quality of life and survival for cancer patients. Genomics holds promise for improving classification and prognostication of malignancies, yet oncology practice continues to rely heavily on immunohistochemistry (IHC) as a fundamental tool due to its practicality and ability to provide protein-level and subcellular localization information. The goal of this proposal is to create an open-source software resource for the quantitative analysis of IHC stained tissues and effective integration of IHC, genomic, and clinical features for cancer classification and prognostication. This proposal builds on our collective experience in computer-assisted analysis of microscopic images (including IHC images), development of machine-learning methods to address the challenges of classification and prognostication with heterogeneous and high-dimensional data, and leadership in collection and large-scale analysis of cancer outcomes involving collaboration with multiple medical centers. This effort for the first time will create tools to integrate quantitative IHC imaging, clinical, and genomic information that will in turn enable the research community to explore strategies for the classification of malignancies and prediction of outcomes. The proposed tools will be developed and extensively validated in close collaboration with clinical, genomic, and digital pathology data from the NCI-supported Lymphoma Epidemiology of Outcomes (LEO) cohort study. The software tools produced by this proposal will enable the characterization of subcellular protein expression in cell nuclei, membranes and cytoplasmic compartments. Spatial features of protein expression heterogeneity, along with patient-level summaries of protein expression will be used to develop machine-learning classifiers for cancer subtypes, using diffuse large b-cell lymphomas as a driving application. Technology for automatic tuning of machine learning algorithms will enable a broad class of clinically and biologically motivated users to utilize these tools in their investigations. We will also provide an interactive dashboard that enables users to integrate genomic and IHC-based features to explore prognostic models of patient survival. These tools will be released and documented under an open-source model, integrated with HistomicsTK (https://histomicstk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), and available to the broader cancer research community.",,Lee Cooper; Christopher R Flowers; Metin Nafi Gurcan,Rao L Divi,425457,425457,2020-05-28T12:05:00Z,2018-06-12T12:06:00Z,2022-05-31T12:05:00Z,PAR-15-332,nofo_PAR-15-332,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,CHICAGO,il,UNITED STATES,itcr,org_state,False

Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is an effective first line therapy for locally advanced or metastatic disease. Unfortunately, once PCa recurs, the eventual development of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) remains an incurable disease and more effective therapies are needed. Currently, a limited number of cancer cell lines (LnCAP, PC3, DU-145, etc.) are available for research and many genetic mutations present in prostate cancer (e.g., SPOP mutation, FOXA1 mutation, TMPRSS2-ERG fusion, CHD1 loss) are not represented in such cells. New patient-derived cancer models are needed. However, patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models are successful at less than 2-5% efficiency with aggressive, high-grade metastatic tumors and organoid cultures only have an efficiency of 20%. However, our preliminary data demonstrate that conditional reprogramming (CR) has nearly a 100% success rate for establishing long-term cultures from either surgical prostate specimens or CT-guided biopsies. In this application, we propose the following specific aims to validate the potential of CR for translational use in human CRPC. We will first establish CR cultures from biopsies of 30 patients with CRPC and will characterize these culture genetically and phenotypically. Second, we compare the patients' drug response to those of corresponding tumor CR cells and their derivative CR- derived xenografts (CDXs). Lastly, we will use CR cultures in an unbiased high-throughput screen to identify new potential therapies for CRPC in collaboration with Dr. Craig Thomas at National Center for Advanced Translational Sciences (NCATS).

A panel of well characterized osteosarcoma patient derived xenografts with genetic changes recapitulating the disease, have been tested by our laboratory as part of the Pediatric Preclinical Testing Program. These efforts thus far have been highly successful in identifying several drugs which are currently being or about to be tested in osteosarcoma clinical trials conducted by the Children's Oncology Group - specifically eribulin and glembatumumab vedotin. Numerous additional osteosarcoma patient derived xenograft models have been developed potentially permitting expansion of the panel of tumors assessed. In this proposal exploration of using a more efficient approach to screen for drug activity in the established models may permit utilization of a broader panel of osteosarcoma patient derived xenografts. In this proposal eltrombopag will be explored for activity in the treatment of osteosarcoma based on promising in vitro data. Building on prior findings, eribulin will be tested for additive activiy with agents routinely used in the treatment of osteosarcoma including cisplatin, cyclophosphamide and etoposide. Finally, a novel ALK inhibitor that also has IGF-1R inhibitory activity, certinib, will be tested as a single agent and in combination with rapamycin for activityin the osteosarcoma patient derived xenografts. These results can be informative for future osteosarcoma clinical trials development as well as potentially identify novel agents that can be considered for clinical trials.",Acute Myelocytic Leukemia;Address;Adolescent and Young Adult;Agonist;Antimitotic Agents;Cell Line;Child;Childhood;Cisplatin;Clinical;Clinical Trials;Conduct Clinical Trials;Cyclophosphamide;Cytotoxic Chemotherapy;Data;Development;Development Plans;Disease;Drug Combinations;Drug Kinetics;Drug resistance;Ensure;Etoposide;Event;Future;Hormones;IGF1R gene;In Vitro;Incidence;Iron Chelation;Laboratories;Lead;Malignant Bone Neoplasm;Modeling;Molecular;Mus;Mutation;New Agents;Patients;Pediatric Oncology Group;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacodynamics;Phase;Phase II Clinical Trials;Physiological;Preclinical Drug Evaluation;Preclinical Testing;Primary Neoplasm;Process;Recurrence;Reporting;Resistance;Resources;Role;Sampling;Sirolimus;Staging;Syndrome;Testing;Therapeutic;Thrombopoietin;Translating;Translations;Xenograft Model;Xenograft procedure;base;bone;cell killing;chemotherapy;clinically actionable;clinically relevant;cytotoxic;data integration;data sharing;design;drug sensitivity;experience;improved;inhibitor/antagonist;molecular marker;novel;osteosarcoma;pre-clinical;programs;public health relevance;receptor;research clinical testing;response;screening;small molecule;targeted treatment;tumor;young adult,Richard G.

1U01CA199288-01,U01CA199288,8968148,2015,In Vivo Drug Testing of Pediatric CNS Tumors Using Patient Derived Orthotopic Xenograft Models,"﻿ DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is prepared in response to the funding opportunity: Pediatric Preclinical Testing Consortium Research Programs (U01), RFA-CA-14-018. Specifically, we propose for Type B: Research Program for tumors of central nervous system (CNS) in vivo testing. Brain tumors are the leading cause of cancer-related death in children. One of the challenges in clinical drug development is how to effectively prioritize drug candidates to ensure clinical success in cancer patients. As pediatric drug candidates are much more numerous than the small number of patients, it is essential to perform comprehensive pre-clinical testing to identify the investigational agents that are most likely to be effective in the clinic. However, such effort has been blocked for many years due to the lack of clinically relevant and molecularly accurate model systems. Fortunately, we have established a large panel (>70) of patient derived orthotopic xenograft (PDOX) models of pediatric brain tumors through direct injection of patient tumor specimens into the brains of SCID mice. These PDOX models are shown to have replicated the histopathological features, invasive phenotypes and major genetic abnormalities (gene expression, DNA copy number and gene mutations) of the original primary tumors even during serial sub-transplantations in vivo in mouse brains. The xenograft tumor cells can also be cryopreserved for sustained and on-demand supply of tumorigenic PDOX cells. This capacity combined with our optimized surgical procedure, with which we can implant up to 260 mice per day, makes it possible for us to test multiple (e.g., 6-10) drugs per year for every tumor type. Our objective is therefore to make use of this unique panel of PDOX models to examine therapeutic efficacy of new agents and to analyze mechanisms of action and therapy resistance in high grade glioma, medulloblastoma and ependymoma. Our hypothesis is that these patient-specific PDOX tumors will respond to anti-cancer therapies similarly to the corresponding human primary tumors, and the effective agents identified through this system would have better chances of clinical success. To test this hypothesis, we will perform a series of in vitro and in vivo assays to achieve the following aims: 1) to identify genetically accurate candidate PDOX models that bear the therapeutic target(s) of new investigational drugs through data mining of our mouse model molecular characterization databases; 2) to select the most responsive models through functional in vitro screening to determine time- and dose- responses; 3) to demonstrate therapeutic efficacy of new investigational drugs in multiple target-bearing PDOX models; and 4) to perform detailed analysis of cellular and molecular mechanisms of cell killing as well as the causes of therapy resistance both in vitro and in vivo. Our novel panel of PDOX mouse models represents a broad spectrum of genetic abnormalities of pediatric CNS tumors. All the assays are well established and routinely performed in our laboratory; we are uniquely positioned to accomplish the proposed drug studies in vivo. Our findings should provide strong preclinical evidence to support the initiation of clinical trials.",Animals;Biological Assay;Biological Models;Brain;Brain Neoplasms;Breeding;Cancer Etiology;Cancer Patient;Cells;Central Nervous System Neoplasms;Cessation of life;Child;Childhood;Childhood Brain Neoplasm;Childhood Central Nervous System Neoplasm;Childhood Glioblastoma;Clinic;Clinical;Clinical Drug Development;Clinical Trials;DNA copy number;Data;Databases;Diffuse;Dose;Ensure;Ependymoma;Evaluation;Faculty;Funding Opportunities;Gene Expression;Gene Expression Profiling;Gene Mutation;Glioblastoma;Glioma;Goals;Housing;Human;Image;Implant;In Vitro;Injection of therapeutic agent;Institution;Investigational Drugs;Laboratories;Medicine;Modeling;Molecular;Molecular Abnormality;Molecular Target;Mus;NOD/SCID mouse;New Agents;Operative Surgical Procedures;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phenotype;Pontine structure;Positioning Attribute;Preclinical Drug Evaluation;Preclinical Testing;Primary Neoplasm;Research;Resistance;SCID Mice;Series;Serum-Free Culture Media;Specimen;System;Techniques;Testing;Time;Transplantation;Treatment Efficacy;Ursidae Family;Xenograft Model;Xenograft procedure;animal facility;base;cancer stem cell;cancer therapy;cell bank;cell killing;clinically relevant;cohort;college;cost effective;data mining;drug candidate;drug testing;exome sequencing;experience;implantation;in vivo;medulloblastoma;member;mouse model;neoplastic cell;new therapeutic target;novel;pre-clinical;programs;public health relevance;radioresistant;research clinical testing;response;screening;success;targeted treatment;therapeutic target;tumor;tumor xenograft;tumorigenic,Xiaonan Li,Malcolm M Smith,604258,604258,2015-07-14T12:07:00Z,2015-07-14T12:07:00Z,2020-06-30T12:06:00Z,RFA-CA-14-018,nofo_RFA-CA-14-018,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,HOUSTON,tx,UNITED STATES,pivot,org_state,False

Our lab’s long- term mission is to identify novel molecular targets in osteosarcoma via comprehensive genomic and proteomic profiling of patient-derived cell lines and xenografts as well as human tumors with the ultimate goal of identifying and/or developing and testing therapeutics against these targets. To achieve this goal, we have a) built a robust profiling platform to identify novel targets; b) expanded our repertoire of osteosarcoma patient derived xenograft (PDX) models to reflect disease heterogeneity; and c) conducted high-throughput in vivo testing of 8-10 new agents each year both as part of Pediatric Preclinical Testing Consortium (PPTC) as well as independent of it. All of these efforts form the basis of our current research proposal and place us strongly poised to successfully achieve our goals. Our overall objective is to efficiently evaluate the efficacy of new agents with high potential to have activity in osteosarcoma based on target data from our genomic and proteomic profiling both as single agents and in rational combinations, with the vision of moving effective agents into clinical trials through the Children’s Oncology Group. We have three specific aims- 1) to select and test agents in vivo against surface targets identified by comprehensive proteomic profiling of osteosarcoma xenografts and patient tumors; 2) to select and test agents in vivo against targets identified by comprehensive genomic profiling of osteosarcoma xenografts and patient tumors; and 3) to perform testing of rationally combined agents based on target, toxicity and efficacy data of single agents. Agents from the PPTC pipeline will be selected based on either the proteomic target or genomic alteration being present in at least a subset of available osteosarcoma PDX models. The agent will be tested in selected cohorts of low/ high expressing protein target or present/ absent genomic alteration. In cases with multiple models with target expression, 3-5 mice per model will be used and in cases with few models available, 8-10 mice per model will be used for control and experiment groups with an overall n per arm per experiment of approximately 30 mice. Standard PPTC procedures will be used for tumor implantation and treatment. Tumor dimensions will be measured twice a week and response quantified as per standard PPTC definitions of complete response, maintained complete response, partial response, stable disease and progressive disease. For combination studies, three potential types of combinations will be considered based on efficacy and toxicity data- a) two surface protein targeted agents such as two antibody-drug conjugates; 2) two molecularly targeted agents and 3) a surface protein targeted agent and a molecularly targeted agent.

The xenograft tumor cells can also be cryopreserved for sustained and on-demand supply of tumorigenic PDOX cells. This capacity combined with our optimized surgical procedure, with which we can implant up to 260 mice per day, makes it possible for us to test multiple (e.g., 6-10) drugs per year for every tumor type. Our objective is therefore to make use of this unique panel of PDOX models to examine therapeutic efficacy of new agents and to analyze mechanisms of action and therapy resistance in high grade glioma, medulloblastoma, ependymoma, DIPG and ATRT. Our hypothesis is that these patient-specific PDOX tumors will respond to anti-cancer therapies similarly to the corresponding human primary tumors, and the effective agents identified through this system would have better chances of clinical success. To test this hypothesis, we will perform a series of in vitro and in vivo assays to achieve the following aims: 1) to identify genetically accurate candidate PDOX models that bear the therapeutic target(s) of new investigational drugs through data mining of our mouse model molecular characterization databases; 2) to select the most responsive models through functional in vitro screening to determine time- and dose-responses; 3) to demonstrate therapeutic efficacy of new investigational drugs in multiple target-bearing PDOX models; and 4) to perform detailed analysis of cellular and molecular mechanisms of cell killing as well as the causes of therapy resistance both in vitro and in vivo. Our novel panel of PDOX mouse models represents a broad spectrum of genetic abnormalities of pediatric CNS tumors. All the assays are well established and routinely performed in our laboratory; we are uniquely positioned to accomplish the proposed drug studies in vivo.

Our lab’s long- term mission is to identify novel molecular targets in osteosarcoma via comprehensive genomic and proteomic profiling of patient-derived cell lines and xenografts as well as human tumors with the ultimate goal of identifying and/or developing and testing therapeutics against these targets. To achieve this goal, we have a) built a robust profiling platform to identify novel targets; b) expanded our repertoire of osteosarcoma patient derived xenograft (PDX) models to reflect disease heterogeneity; and c) conducted high-throughput in vivo testing of 8-10 new agents each year both as part of Pediatric Preclinical Testing Consortium (PPTC) as well as independent of it. All of these efforts form the basis of our current research proposal and place us strongly poised to successfully achieve our goals. Our overall objective is to efficiently evaluate the efficacy of new agents with high potential to have activity in osteosarcoma based on target data from our genomic and proteomic profiling both as single agents and in rational combinations, with the vision of moving effective agents into clinical trials through the Children’s Oncology Group. We have three specific aims- 1) to select and test agents in vivo against surface targets identified by comprehensive proteomic profiling of osteosarcoma xenografts and patient tumors; 2) to select and test agents in vivo against targets identified by comprehensive genomic profiling of osteosarcoma xenografts and patient tumors; and 3) to perform testing of rationally combined agents based on target, toxicity and efficacy data of single agents. Agents from the PPTC pipeline will be selected based on either the proteomic target or genomic alteration being present in at least a subset of available osteosarcoma PDX models. The agent will be tested in selected cohorts of low/ high expressing protein target or present/ absent genomic alteration. In cases with multiple models with target expression, 3-5 mice per model will be used and in cases with few models available, 8-10 mice per model will be used for control and experiment groups with an overall n per arm per experiment of approximately 30 mice. Standard PPTC procedures will be used for tumor implantation and treatment. Tumor dimensions will be measured twice a week and response quantified as per standard PPTC definitions of complete response, maintained complete response, partial response, stable disease and progressive disease. For combination studies, three potential types of combinations will be considered based on efficacy and toxicity data- a) two surface protein targeted agents such as two antibody-drug conjugates; 2) two molecularly targeted agents and 3) a surface protein targeted agent and a molecularly targeted agent.

Specifically, we propose for Type B: Research Program for tumors of central nervous system (CNS) in vivo testing. Brain tumors are the leading cause of cancer-related death in children. One of the challenges in clinical drug development is how to effectively prioritize drug candidates to ensure clinical success in cancer patients. As pediatric drug candidates are much more numerous than the small number of patients, it is essential to perform comprehensive pre-clinical testing to identify the investigational agents that are most likely to be effective in the clinic. However, such effort has been blocked for many years due to the lack of clinically relevant and molecularly accurate model systems. Fortunately, we have established a large panel (>70) of patient derived orthotopic xenograft (PDOX) models of pediatric brain tumors through direct injection of patient tumor specimens into the brains of SCID mice. These PDOX models are shown to have replicated the histopathological features, invasive phenotypes and major genetic abnormalities (gene expression, DNA copy number and gene mutations) of the original primary tumors even during serial sub-transplantations in vivo in mouse brains. The xenograft tumor cells can also be cryopreserved for sustained and on-demand supply of tumorigenic PDOX cells. This capacity combined with our optimized surgical procedure, with which we can implant up to 260 mice per day, makes it possible for us to test multiple (e.g., 6-10) drugs per year for every tumor type. Our objective is therefore to make use of this unique panel of PDOX models to examine therapeutic efficacy of new agents and to analyze mechanisms of action and therapy resistance in high grade glioma, medulloblastoma and ependymoma. Our hypothesis is that these patient-specific PDOX tumors will respond to anti-cancer therapies similarly to the corresponding human primary tumors, and the effective agents identified through this system would have better chances of clinical success. To test this hypothesis, we will perform a series of in vitro and in vivo assays to achieve the following aims: 1) to identify genetically accurate candidate PDOX models that bear the therapeutic target(s) of new investigational drugs through data mining of our mouse model molecular characterization databases; 2) to select the most responsive models through functional in vitro screening to determine time- and dose- responses; 3) to demonstrate therapeutic efficacy of new investigational drugs in multiple target-bearing PDOX models; and 4) to perform detailed analysis of cellular and molecular mechanisms of cell killing as well as the causes of therapy resistance both in vitro and in vivo. Our novel panel of PDOX mouse models represents a broad spectrum of genetic abnormalities of pediatric CNS tumors.

This capacity combined with our optimized surgical procedure, with which we can implant up to 260 mice per day, makes it possible for us to test multiple (e.g., 6-10) drugs per year for every tumor type. Our objective is therefore to make use of this unique panel of PDOX models to examine therapeutic efficacy of new agents and to analyze mechanisms of action and therapy resistance in high grade glioma, medulloblastoma and ependymoma. Our hypothesis is that these patient-specific PDOX tumors will respond to anti-cancer therapies similarly to the corresponding human primary tumors, and the effective agents identified through this system would have better chances of clinical success. To test this hypothesis, we will perform a series of in vitro and in vivo assays to achieve the following aims: 1) to identify genetically accurate candidate PDOX models that bear the therapeutic target(s) of new investigational drugs through data mining of our mouse model molecular characterization databases; 2) to select the most responsive models through functional in vitro screening to determine time- and dose- responses; 3) to demonstrate therapeutic efficacy of new investigational drugs in multiple target-bearing PDOX models; and 4) to perform detailed analysis of cellular and molecular mechanisms of cell killing as well as the causes of therapy resistance both in vitro and in vivo. Our novel panel of PDOX mouse models represents a broad spectrum of genetic abnormalities of pediatric CNS tumors.

Specifically, we propose for Type B: Research Program for tumors of central nervous system (CNS) in vivo testing. Brain tumors are the leading cause of cancer-related death in children. One of the challenges in clinical drug development is how to effectively prioritize drug candidates to ensure clinical success in cancer patients. As pediatric drug candidates are much more numerous than the small number of patients, it is essential to perform comprehensive pre-clinical testing to identify the investigational agents that are most likely to be effective in the clinic. However, such effort has been blocked for many years due to the lack of clinically relevant and molecularly accurate model systems. Fortunately, we have established a large panel (>70) of patient derived orthotopic xenograft (PDOX) models of pediatric brain tumors through direct injection of patient tumor specimens into the brains of SCID mice. These PDOX models are shown to have replicated the histopathological features, invasive phenotypes and major genetic abnormalities (gene expression, DNA copy number and gene mutations) of the original primary tumors even during serial sub-transplantations in vivo in mouse brains.

1U01CA274304-01,U01CA274304,10517972,2022,Reprogramming PDAC Stroma by Targeting Coagulation in the Tumor Microenvironment,"PROJECT SUMMARY The overarching goal of this research program is to identify therapeutic strategies to convert the stroma of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) to a chemo- and immune-sensitive tumor microenvironment (TME). PDAC is characterized by a desmoplastic stroma that facilitates tumor growth/invasion, chemoresistance of pancreatic cancer cells (PCC), and immunosuppressive TME. Highly packed cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and dense extracellular matrix (ECM) are hallmarks of the PDAC stroma and constitute physical drug delivery barriers. Several stromal components have been targeted to enhance drug delivery, but recent studies have suggested anti-tumor roles for the stroma as complete ablation of stromal components leads to more aggressive tumors. New strategies are highly desired to reprogram stroma without compromising its anti-tumor roles. The central hypothesis is that the coagulation system in the PDAC TME can be targeted to reprogram PDAC stroma to overcome chemoresistance, drug delivery barriers, and immunosuppressive TME. Cancer- associated coagulation has been reported as a key functional signaling pathway in PDAC. Notably, several coagulation molecular targets, including thrombin, protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1), and fibrinogen/fibrin, have been implicated in important roles contributing to tumor progression and therapeutic resistance. Specifically, it is hypothesized that the thrombin-PAR1 signaling axis can be targeted to suppress PCC growth/invasion and CAF growth/fibrosis. In addition, thrombin-mediated fibrin deposition can be targeted to suppress the drug delivery barrier and immunosuppressive TAM activities, which suppresses anti-tumor T cell activities. This hypothesis will be tested mechanistically and evaluated for translational potential by pursuing the following two integrated aims: Aim 1) Mechanistic Research: Determine the contribution of the coagulation targets in the PDAC TME. Specifically, the team will determine the role of thrombin-PAR1 signaling axis to CAF-mediated fibrosis, thrombin-mediated fibrin deposition on drug resistance, and PAR1/fibrin on the immunosuppressive TME. Aim 2) Translational Research: Evaluate the pharmacological inhibition of the coagulation targets. Especially, the team will expand the mechanistic understanding from Aim 1 using patient- derived PDAC models with FDA-approved inhibitors of thrombin and PAR1, and fibrinogen depleting agents. The effects of pharmacological inhibition will feedback to Aim 1 to delineate the efficacy of inhibiting coagulation targets.

PDAC is characterized by a desmoplastic stroma that facilitates tumor growth/invasion, chemoresistance of pancreatic cancer cells (PCC), and immunosuppressive TME. Highly packed cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and dense extracellular matrix (ECM) are hallmarks of the PDAC stroma and constitute physical drug delivery barriers. Several stromal components have been targeted to enhance drug delivery, but recent studies have suggested anti-tumor roles for the stroma as complete ablation of stromal components leads to more aggressive tumors. New strategies are highly desired to reprogram stroma without compromising its anti-tumor roles. The central hypothesis is that the coagulation system in the PDAC TME can be targeted to reprogram PDAC stroma to overcome chemoresistance, drug delivery barriers, and immunosuppressive TME. Cancer- associated coagulation has been reported as a key functional signaling pathway in PDAC. Notably, several coagulation molecular targets, including thrombin, protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1), and fibrinogen/fibrin, have been implicated in important roles contributing to tumor progression and therapeutic resistance. Specifically, it is hypothesized that the thrombin-PAR1 signaling axis can be targeted to suppress PCC growth/invasion and CAF growth/fibrosis. In addition, thrombin-mediated fibrin deposition can be targeted to suppress the drug delivery barrier and immunosuppressive TAM activities, which suppresses anti-tumor T cell activities. This hypothesis will be tested mechanistically and evaluated for translational potential by pursuing the following two integrated aims: Aim 1) Mechanistic Research: Determine the contribution of the coagulation targets in the PDAC TME. Specifically, the team will determine the role of thrombin-PAR1 signaling axis to CAF-mediated fibrosis, thrombin-mediated fibrin deposition on drug resistance, and PAR1/fibrin on the immunosuppressive TME. Aim 2) Translational Research: Evaluate the pharmacological inhibition of the coagulation targets. Especially, the team will expand the mechanistic understanding from Aim 1 using patient- derived PDAC models with FDA-approved inhibitors of thrombin and PAR1, and fibrinogen depleting agents. The effects of pharmacological inhibition will feedback to Aim 1 to delineate the efficacy of inhibiting coagulation targets. The outcome of this research will establish a new mechanistic understanding of the role of coagulation activities in the PDAC TME. It will determine whether blockade of the coagulation is a promising strategy to reprogram the PDAC stroma and, ultimately, suppress PCC/CAF growth and improve drug delivery and efficacy.",Ablation;Animal Model;Biomimetics;Blood coagulation;Blood specimen;CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes;Cancer Cell Growth;Cancer Etiology;Cessation of life;Chemoresistance;Clinical;Coagulation Process;Collagen;Data;Deposition;Desmoplastic;Disease;Drug Delivery Systems;Drug resistance;Economics;Evaluation;Extracellular Matrix;Extracellular Matrix Proteins;FDA approved;Feedback;Fibrin;Fibrinogen;Fibroblasts;Fibrosis;Goals;Growth;Healthcare;Healthcare Systems;Hyaluronan;Immune;Invaded;Knowledge;Lead;Libraries;Malignant Neoplasms;Malignant neoplasm of pancreas;Mediating;Molecular;Molecular Target;Outcome;Outcomes Research;PAR-1 Receptor;Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma;Patients;Peptide Hydrolases;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Reagent;Reporting;Research;Resistance;Role;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;Survival Rate;Syndrome;System;T-Lymphocyte;Testing;Therapeutic;Thrombin;Tissue Model;Translating;Translational Research;Treatment outcome;Tumor-associated macrophages;clinically relevant;drug efficacy;efficacy validation;improved;in vivo;inhibitor;novel strategies;pancreatic cancer cells;pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cell;pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma model;pharmacologic;programs;recruit;standard of care;therapeutically effective;therapy resistant;translational potential;tumor;tumor growth;tumor microenvironment;tumor progression;tumor-immune system interactions;vascular inflammation;venous thromboembolism,Melissa L Fishel; Matthew J.

Pathologically, BC is diagnosed as non-muscle-invasive (NMI) and muscle-invasive (MI) disease. Here we define early bladder lesions as NMIBC. Major clinical gaps in NMIBC include i) lack of mechanistic insights defining NMIBC progression, and ii) lack of platform for risk stratification of NMIBC that recur but never progress (“non-progressors”), from those that progresses into MIBC (“progressors”) and consequently demonstrate poor prognosis. The goal of our Center is to tackle this clinical issue by deciphering the underlying mechanisms restraining or promoting the progression of early lesions (Project 1 & 2), and to leverage this novel biology as candidate biomarkers to risk-stratify aggressive NMIBC (Project 3). This proposal seeks to shift the current research paradigm in the field of NMIBC, by proposing a conceptually innovative tug-of-war between a tumor- restraining (Project 1) and a tumor-promoting mechanism (Project 2) in determining the outcome of early bladder lesions/NMIBC in becoming “progressors” or “non-progressors” (Project 3). Clinically, why “non-progressors” often recur but seldom progress, and what are the driving forces advancing “progressors” into MIBC with poor survival remain fundamental questions in field. Our tug-of-war hypothesis with two opposing forces is conceptually different to most other studies, which primarily focus on one side of the coin. Further, the integration of knowledge from Project 1 and 2 as a unified spatial proteomics and transcriptomics map by the Shared Resource Core will reveal spatial and temporal relationships between distinct fibroblast populations with opposing functions, their physical interactions with tumor and immune cell clusters, as well as their relationship to the biomarkers from Project 3. Benchmark of success: The knowledge gained here will shift clinical practice paradigm, by informing future NIMBC management through 1) the development of novel urinary profiling strategies that could risk stratify aggressive NMIBC (Project 1-3); 2) the identification of targets for future precision intervention, either by enhancing/sustaining the tumor-restraining mechanisms (Project 1) and/or inhibiting the tumor-promoting mechanisms (Project 2).

GBM tumors do not metastasize. Instead, they aggressively infiltrate the brain. Tumor borders are highly vascularized by microvessels that serve as key niche environments promoting GBM cell survival, treatment resistance and migration. Currently, it is believed that a subpopulation of treatment-resistant, stem- like GBM cells (GSCs) migrate away from primary tumors — remaining in close contact with local microvessels — and seed recurrent tumors — which are enriched in GSCs. However, the mechanisms underlying the influence of the microvessel niche on GBM cell migration away from primary tumors, leading to recurrence, remain largely unknown. To address this gap in knowledge, the proposed studies will investigate 1) the role of specific cues in the tumor microenvironment on the migratory phenotype of GBM cells and 2) how these cues differentially affect distinct subpopulations of cells within heterogeneous tumors, including GSCs. Our fundamental hypothesis is that the microenvironment surrounding tumor microvessels promotes GBM progression through both mechanical and chemical means. Aim 1 will investigate effects of mechanical cues and Aim 2 effects of biochemical cues present in the microvessel niche on migratory phenotype of GBM. To do this, we will use an innovative, tissue- engineered platform for 3D culture of patient-derived GBM cells to quantify how specific features of the microenvironment affect migratory behavior. We propose to modularly tune mechanical and chemical properties of culture platforms to characterize their independent effects on migratory phenotype of GBM. For some experiments, platforms will be constructed with an interface between defined microenvironments through which GBM cells can migrate, enabling separation of migratory and non-migratory cells for downstream analysis and providing information about how subpopulations of cells within a single tumor, such as GSCs, may respond differentially to microenvironmental cues. As treatment resistance, invasion and recurrence are inter-related events, we will investigate how exposure to routine clinical therapies may alter migratory responses of GBM to microenvironmental cues. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we will investigate the mechanisms underlying responses to specific features of the microvessel niche. Collectively, the proposed studies will make significant strides towards our understanding of how interactions of GBM with the microvessel niche promote tumor recurrence by characterizing: 1) biomechanical properties of GBM tumors and microvessels (Aim 1), 2) migratory response of GBM cells to biochemical and biomechanical cues (Aims 1 and 2) and 3) mechanisms governing the migratory responses to biochemical and biomechanical cues (Aims 1 and 2).

For some experiments, platforms will be constructed with an interface between defined microenvironments through which GBM cells can migrate, enabling separation of migratory and non-migratory cells for downstream analysis and providing information about how subpopulations of cells within a single tumor, such as GSCs, may respond differentially to microenvironmental cues. As treatment resistance, invasion and recurrence are inter-related events, we will investigate how exposure to routine clinical therapies may alter migratory responses of GBM to microenvironmental cues. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we will investigate the mechanisms underlying responses to specific features of the microvessel niche. Collectively, the proposed studies will make significant strides towards our understanding of how interactions of GBM with the microvessel niche promote tumor recurrence by characterizing: 1) biomechanical properties of GBM tumors and microvessels (Aim 1), 2) migratory response of GBM cells to biochemical and biomechanical cues (Aims 1 and 2) and 3) mechanisms governing the migratory responses to biochemical and biomechanical cues (Aims 1 and 2). In the long term, we expect these insights will lead to the development of new therapies targeting GBM recurrence. !",3-Dimensional;Address;Affect;Atomic Force Microscopy;Behavior;Biochemical;Biocompatible Materials;Biomechanics;Biomedical Engineering;Blood Vessels;Brain;Cell Communication;Cell Culture Techniques;Cell Survival;Cell secretion;Cells;Chemicals;Chemotherapy and/or radiation;Clinical;Coculture Techniques;Coupling;Cues;Development;Endothelial Cells;Environment;Event;Excision;Exhibits;Experimental Models;Exposure to;Extracellular Matrix;Glioblastoma;Glioma;Heterogeneity;Individual;Infiltration;Invaded;Knowledge;Malignant neoplasm of brain;Measures;Mechanics;Modeling;Operative Surgical Procedures;Patients;Phenotype;Population Heterogeneity;Primary Neoplasm;Proliferating;Property;Recurrence;Recurrent tumor;Reporting;Resistance;Role;Site;Stimulus;Tissue Engineering;Tissues;Tumor Cell Invasion;Tumor Cell Migration;Tumor Promotion;Vascularization;Xenograft procedure;brain tissue;cancer cell;cell behavior;cell motility;chemical property;combat;effective therapy;experimental study;innovation;insight;mechanical properties;mechanical signal;migration;neoplastic cell;neuro-oncology;new therapeutic target;response;single-cell RNA sequencing;stem;targeted treatment;therapy resistant;three dimensional cell culture;transcriptomics;treatment response;tumor;tumor microenvironment;tumor progression;tumor xenograft;virtual,Stephanie Kristin Seidlits,Steven Becker,347894,347894,2023-02-01T12:02:00Z,2020-02-13T12:02:00Z,2025-01-31T12:01:00Z,PAR-19-113,nofo_PAR-19-113,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN,AUSTIN,tx,UNITED STATES,tec,org_state,False
5R01CA241927-06,R01CA241927,10774250,2024,Tissue-Engineered Models of Glioblastoma for Evaluating Treatment Response,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is a uniformly fatal brain cancer with poor response to treatment and virtually inevitable recurrence. GBM tumors do not metastasize. Instead, they aggressively infiltrate the brain. Tumor borders are highly vascularized by microvessels that serve as key niche environments promoting GBM cell survival, treatment resistance and migration. Currently, it is believed that a subpopulation of treatment-resistant, stem- like GBM cells (GSCs) migrate away from primary tumors — remaining in close contact with local microvessels — and seed recurrent tumors — which are enriched in GSCs. However, the mechanisms underlying the influence of the microvessel niche on GBM cell migration away from primary tumors, leading to recurrence, remain largely unknown. To address this gap in knowledge, the proposed studies will investigate 1) the role of specific cues in the tumor microenvironment on the migratory phenotype of GBM cells and 2) how these cues differentially affect distinct subpopulations of cells within heterogeneous tumors, including GSCs. Our fundamental hypothesis is that the microenvironment surrounding tumor microvessels promotes GBM progression through both mechanical and chemical means. Aim 1 will investigate effects of mechanical cues and Aim 2 effects of biochemical cues present in the microvessel niche on migratory phenotype of GBM. To do this, we will use an innovative, tissue- engineered platform for 3D culture of patient-derived GBM cells to quantify how specific features of the microenvironment affect migratory behavior. We propose to modularly tune mechanical and chemical properties of culture platforms to characterize their independent effects on migratory phenotype of GBM.
