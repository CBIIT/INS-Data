Over 4000 members of the Group including oncology physicians, statisticians, clinical research associates, oncology nurses, pharmacists, epidemiologists, and basic scientists participate in these studies. From 25-35 Phase Ill protocols are active at any one time, along with Phase II and Phase I studies that provide preliminary data required for the appropriate design of large scale randomized trials. In 2001 the CALGB accrued nearly 6662 entries to its protocols. Multidisciplinary disease committees of the Group design and implement protocols for the treatment of patients with leukemia, lymphoma, breast, respiratory, GI and GU cancers and melanoma. Modality committees, including Leukemia Correlative Sciences, Solid Tumor Correlative Sciences, Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, Surgery, Pathology, Radiation Oncology, Transplant, Cancer in the Elderly, Cancer Control and Health Outcomes, Oncology Nursing, and Clinical Research Associates serve as the sites for planning and implementing new approaches for these disciplines. Major areas of emphasis in CALGB include development of innovative treatments for patients with cancer; studies of molecular predictors of prognosis and response to therapy; studies of the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and pharmacogenetics of new and established anticancer drugs; evaluation of minimally invasive surgical techniques; determining the cost and cost-effectiveness of new cancer therapies; evaluating the impact of cancer and its treatment on the quality of life of cancer patients and their caregivers; developing new strategies for cancer prevention; and addressing the needs of special populations, particularly minorities and the elderly.

However, the late effects of cancer treatment, including permanent organ and tissue damage, hormonal and reproductive dysfunction and second cancers, are of special concern, with more than 40% of the estimated 360,000 survivors of childhood cancer experiencing a significant health-related quality of life complication from childhood cancer and its treatment. In addition, progress for a number of childhood cancers remains limited with approximately 50% of children with acute myelogenous leukemia, 50% of children with high-risk neuroblastoma, and more than 90% of children with brainstem glioma, still succumbing to their disease. The Children’s Oncology Group (COG), the world’s largest organization devoted exclusively to childhood and adolescent cancer research, and its multidisciplinary research teams comprised of more than 9,000 members, conducts research at more than 220 leading children’s hospitals, universities, and cancer centers. This proposal is for the COG NCI Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP) Research Base to continue its collaborative research work for our 26 community and 16 minority/underserved NCORP sites.

Precision cancer medicine, which seeks to exploit unique cellular, molecular and genetic characteristics of individual tumors to optimize treatment, remains a critically unmet need. Despite advances in biomarker technologies that yield high-quality cellular and genomic data, critical gaps remain to consistently match patients with cancer and ideal therapies. While `predictive' genomic assays based on RNA and DNA are now commonplace, current methods largely ignore tumor phenotypes differentiable by quantitative imaging. The overarching vision for VU-PREDICT is a suite of quantitative imaging tools that facilitate the discovery of novel, predictive imaging-derived gene expression signatures; such signatures can be deployed by the greater oncology community to improve the personalization of cancer treatment. The linchpin of VU-PREDICT will be positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. The sensitive and quantitative nature of PET, coupled with the ability to produce biologically active PET tracers, renders PET uniquely capable of both detecting tumors and profiling their specific features. Complementary to genomic approaches, PET imaging provides a quantitative, functional measure of tumor phenotype, and when coupled biopsy approaches, can provide a significantly greater breadth of biological characterization. VU-PREDICT centers on a parallel co-clinical trial of patients with advanced colorectal cancer (CRC) and human-in-mouse PDX (patient-derived xenograft) models. CRC is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs; cetuximab, panitumumab) are approved for treatment of advanced wild-type (WT) RAS CRC. However, durable responses to anti-EGFR mAbs occur in only 12–17% of patients. VU-PREDICT will capitalize upon a Phase I/II clinical trial opening at Vanderbilt combining a glutaminase (GLS1) inhibitor (CB-839, Calithera), EGFR mAb therapy (panitumumab) and irinotecan in patients with advanced and refractory WT RAS CRC. It is anticipated that combining CB-839 with EGFR mAb therapy will resensitize refractory CRC patients with Gln- avid tumors to EGFR blockade. VU-PREDICT will allow our development of quantitative PET imaging measures within this trial and in related preclinical studies that may identify patients likely to respond to combined GLS1/EGFR inhibition.

5U24CA220325-05,U24CA220325,10479160,2022,MDACC-PREDICT,"Project Summary This application proposes a new U24 Oncology Co-Clinical Imaging Resource entitled VU-PREDICT (Vanderbilt University-PET imaging Resource to Enhance Delivery of Individualized Cancer Therapeutics). Precision cancer medicine, which seeks to exploit unique cellular, molecular and genetic characteristics of individual tumors to optimize treatment, remains a critically unmet need. Despite advances in biomarker technologies that yield high-quality cellular and genomic data, critical gaps remain to consistently match patients with cancer and ideal therapies. While `predictive' genomic assays based on RNA and DNA are now commonplace, current methods largely ignore tumor phenotypes differentiable by quantitative imaging. The overarching vision for VU-PREDICT is a suite of quantitative imaging tools that facilitate the discovery of novel, predictive imaging-derived gene expression signatures; such signatures can be deployed by the greater oncology community to improve the personalization of cancer treatment. The linchpin of VU-PREDICT will be positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. The sensitive and quantitative nature of PET, coupled with the ability to produce biologically active PET tracers, renders PET uniquely capable of both detecting tumors and profiling their specific features. Complementary to genomic approaches, PET imaging provides a quantitative, functional measure of tumor phenotype, and when coupled biopsy approaches, can provide a significantly greater breadth of biological characterization. VU-PREDICT centers on a parallel co-clinical trial of patients with advanced colorectal cancer (CRC) and human-in-mouse PDX (patient-derived xenograft) models. CRC is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs; cetuximab, panitumumab) are approved for treatment of advanced wild-type (WT) RAS CRC. However, durable responses to anti-EGFR mAbs occur in only 12–17% of patients. VU-PREDICT will capitalize upon a Phase I/II clinical trial opening at Vanderbilt combining a glutaminase (GLS1) inhibitor (CB-839, Calithera), EGFR mAb therapy (panitumumab) and irinotecan in patients with advanced and refractory WT RAS CRC. It is anticipated that combining CB-839 with EGFR mAb therapy will resensitize refractory CRC patients with Gln- avid tumors to EGFR blockade. VU-PREDICT will allow our development of quantitative PET imaging measures within this trial and in related preclinical studies that may identify patients likely to respond to combined GLS1/EGFR inhibition.

To evaluate their potential for translation, we will integrate these dynamic models with clinical trials that will evaluate whether these phenotypic changes can be targeted for therapy. We hypothesize that acquired resistance emerges from selection acting on phenotypes during tumor evolution, and that simultaneously measuring and modeling subclone genotypes and phenotypes will identify new, and testable, therapeutic targets. Selective pressures from therapy and the tumor microenvironment can propel subclones from every patient's tumor along an evolutionary trajectory that leads to resistance. Indeed, our data shows that both genetic and phenotypic diversity among tumor subclones evolves as cancer cells progress to a resistant state. However, it is not yet known the specific phenotypes that promote that resistant state, the interactions among them, and how they converge to common resistant phenotypes seen in late stage cancer. To address these and other questions, we will develop a new class of dynamical systems models of subclone evolution to characterize the changes and development of key cell states that arise during acquired chemo-resistance and metastasis using our unique patient cohorts. These mechanistic models will identify points of therapeutic vulnerability that we will test in clinical trials aimed at blocking evolution to a resistant state by targeting critical resistant phenotypes. Our Center is comprised of an Administrative, Education/Outreach, Translational, and Computational Cores, in addition to two complementary projects. The synergies are derived from: 1) the convergent parameterization of the evolutionary models drawn from deep longitudinal patient progression studies (Project 1) and broad multisite metastatic tumor analyses (Project 2), resulting in a robust model to identify resistant states for clinical targeting; and 2) an integrated computational and experimental framework and resources for dissecting tumor heterogeneity and evolution that will contribute to an improved capacity for personalized cancer therapy.

7U54CA209978-02,U54CA209978,9482409,2017,Combating Subclonal Evolution of Resistant Cancer Phenotypes,"Overall abstract Our Cancer Systems Biology Center of HoPE (Heterogeneity of Phenotypic Evolution) will develop a suite of systems-based methodologies to understand how genomic diversity, clonal evolution, and phenotypic change . To evaluate their potential for translation, we will integrate these dynamic models with clinical trials that will evaluate whether these phenotypic changes can be targeted for therapy. We hypothesize that acquired resistance emerges from selection acting on phenotypes during tumor evolution, and that simultaneously measuring and modeling subclone genotypes and phenotypes will identify new, and testable, therapeutic targets. Selective pressures from therapy and the tumor microenvironment can propel subclones from every patient's tumor along an evolutionary trajectory that leads to resistance. Indeed, our data shows that both genetic and phenotypic diversity among tumor subclones evolves as cancer cells progress to a resistant state. However, it is not yet known the specific phenotypes that promote that resistant state, the interactions among them, and how they converge to common resistant phenotypes seen in late stage cancer. To address these and other questions, we will develop a new class of dynamical systems models of subclone evolution to characterize the changes and development of key cell states that arise during acquired chemo-resistance and metastasis using our unique patient cohorts. These mechanistic models will identify points of therapeutic vulnerability that we will test in clinical trials aimed at blocking evolution to a resistant state by targeting critical resistant phenotypes. Our Center is comprised of an Administrative, Education/Outreach, Translational, and Computational Cores, in addition to two complementary projects. The synergies are derived from: 1) the convergent parameterization of the evolutionary models drawn from deep longitudinal patient progression studies (Project 1) and broad multisite metastatic tumor analyses (Project 2), resulting in a robust model to identify resistant states for clinical targeting; and 2) an integrated computational and experimental framework and resources for dissecting tumor heterogeneity and evolution that will contribute to an improved capacity for personalized cancer therapy. Our multidisciplinary team of systems biologists, bioinformaticians, tumor biologists, pharmacologists, mathematical biologists, and clinicians will tackle these scientific challenges. We will create programs to educate the next generation of scientists in systems biology and inform the community about the latest scientific advances and their impact on treatment strategies. And we will provide state of the art tools for the analysis of patient samples and tumor genomic complexity. These studies move beyond prior research by integrating cell population dynamics and cellular phenotypes with cellular genotypes, and will deliver approaches and a knowledge base to block or reverse the transition to a resistant state for advanced stage cancer patients. interact in the progression toward chemoresistant breast and ovarian cancer",,Andrea Hope Bild,Shannon K Hughes,1531573,1531573,2018-03-16T12:03:00Z,2017-05-15T12:05:00Z,2022-06-30T12:06:00Z,RFA-CA-15-014,nofo_RFA-CA-15-014,beckman research institute/city of hope,DUARTE,CA,UNITED STATES,csbc,org_name,False

These efforts have uncovered a staggering level of genome complexity in cancer. Although much is known about the function and clinical impact of recurrent aberrations in well-known cancer genes, less is known about which and how the more abundant, low-frequency mutations contribute to tumor progression. Effective translation of tumor genomic datasets into cancer therapeutics will require new experimental systems to inform the functional activity of targets in the relevant biological context encompassing inter- and intra-tumoral heterogeneity. To address these needs, we propose a CTD2 Center that will provide the research community high-throughput informatic and experimental approaches to characterize and validate pathogenic “driver” mutations and fusion genes as well as identify molecular markers that meaningfully predict responses or resistance to anticancer therapies. We will pursue the following Specific Aims: In Aim 1 we will implement an algorithmic framework for identifying driver mutations with high sensitivity and specificity. We will focus our algorithm development, training and testing efforts on predicting oncogenic, gain-of-function mutation drivers of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). These computational approaches will be amenable to the analysis of all cancer types. We will next engineer ~1,500 selected mutations and ~400 fusion genes into expression vectors along with cohorts of personalized, patient-defined coding mutations. In Aim 2 we will enter mutant alleles and fusion genes into GBM, PDAC and EOC context-specific, in vivo functional screens that take into account the importance of genetic context, tumor microenvironment and heterogeneity in the selection of single and combinatorial drivers of tumorigenesis. In Aim 3 we will determine the consequences of intra-tumoral heterogeneity on tumor sensitivity and resistance to therapeutic agents using DNA-barcoded, human patient-derived xenograft models that recapitulate the heterogeneity of cancer. We will determine the extent to which single targeted agents and their rational combinations alter tumor population dynamics. We will also leverage Aim 1 informatics and functional characterizations in Aim 2 and 4 to characterize “persistor” populations to identify aberrations associated with drug resistance. In Aim 4 we will use high-throughput functional proteomics, innovative protein- protein interaction assays and informer drug library screening studies to elucidate underlying mechanisms and therapeutic liabilities engendered by validated drivers.

However, many commonly mutated cancer genes resist efforts to target with drugs, genetic heterogeneity of tumors confounds choice or efficacy of drugs, and development of resistance to commonly used therapies is common, leaving few alternatives. New approaches are needed to address these challenges. Exploiting cellular vulnerabilities generated as a result of mutations in commonly mutated genes, e.g. synthetic lethality, is a promising approach, as illustrated by the recent approval of the PARP inhibitor olaparib in ovarian cancer. We have developed and optimized a synthetic lethal discovery platform that entails high throughput screening to identify novel targets in patient-derived cancer cell cultures and isogenic cell systems. Integration of functional screen results with both patient specific (N of 1) and population-based genomic data is used to prioritize targets useful to the greatest number of patients and in the most appropriate genomic and molecular contexts. Prioritized targets undergo exhaustive confirmation and orthogonal validation in physiologically-relevant settings including genomically characterized patient-derived cell cultures, organoids and patient derived xenograft (PDX) models. Synthetic lethal genes identified with our platform are conserved across species, have been confirmed as candidate drug targets across multiple human cancer types and have led to an investigator initiated clinical trial, illustrating the translational utility of our platform. The outcome of this proposal will be novel validated targets and therapeutic strategies to several human cancer types including those resistant to standard of care agents and a deeper understanding of the biology of several major cancer genes.",Address;Affect;Autologous;Biochemical;Bioinformatics;Biological Assay;Biological Markers;Biology;Biopsy;Cancer Biology;Cancer Model;Cell Culture Techniques;Cells;Clinical;Clinical Oncology;Clinical Trials;Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats;Complex;Computational Biology;DNA sequencing;Data;Data Set;Development;Drug Combinations;Drug Targeting;Drug resistance;Event;Future;Gene Targeting;Genes;Genetic;Genetic Heterogeneity;Genome;Genomics;Genotype;Goals;Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma;Human;Imagery;Immunotherapy;KRAS2 gene;Knock-out;Lethal Genes;Malignant Neoplasms;Malignant neoplasm of ovary;Methods;Modeling;Molecular;Mutate;Mutation;Neoadjuvant Therapy;Oncogenes;Operative Surgical Procedures;Organoids;Outcome;Outcomes Research;Patient Representative;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phenotype;Physiological;Predictive Value;Research Personnel;Resistance;Resistance development;Screening Result;Small Interfering RNA;Solid Neoplasm;Surgical Oncology;System;TP53 gene;Test Result;Testing;Therapeutic Agents;Translations;Tumor-Derived;Validation;Work;Xenograft Model;cancer cell;cancer genomics;cancer type;drug candidate;drug development;drug discovery;drug efficacy;exhaustion;gene function;genomic aberrations;genomic data;high throughput screening;inhibitor/antagonist;innovation;insight;molecular subtypes;mouse model;mutant;neoplastic cell;new therapeutic target;novel;novel strategies;novel therapeutics;oncology;population based;pre-clinical;precision medicine;precision oncology;preclinical development;predictive modeling;profiles in patients;resistance mechanism;response;screening;small hairpin RNA;small molecule inhibitor;standard of care;statistics;success;targeted agent;targeted cancer therapy;targeted treatment;tool;tumor;tumor heterogeneity,Christopher J Kemp,Daniela Gerhard,902672,902672,2017-09-14T12:09:00Z,2017-09-14T12:09:00Z,2022-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-16-014,nofo_RFA-CA-16-014,fred hutchinson cancer research center,SEATTLE,WA,UNITED STATES,ctd_2,org_name,False

1U01CA214172-01,U01CA214172,9277686,2016,A unique approach combining avatar mice and targeted mass spectrometry to identify blood biomarkers for early detection of breast cancer,"Project Summary/Abstract Tens of millions of women undergo population-based screening for breast cancer by mammography. De- spite the life-saving potential of early detection, screening guidelines for mammography are controversial and continue to evolve. At issue are the specificity of mammography for distinguishing benign vs cancerous le- sions, the sensitivity of mammography in some patient populations (e.g. women with dense breasts), and con- cerns regarding over-diagnosis (e.g. some ductal carcinoma in situ). Our ultimate clinical aim is to develop a blood test for early detection of breast cancer that can be used in conjunction with mammography to improve sensitivity and specificity during screening, and thus have enormous clinical impact by detecting treatable can- cers missed by mammography (reducing mortality) and by avoiding unnecessary invasive procedures for be- nign or non-life-threatening disease. Despite considerable effort, attempts to identify blood-based screening biomarkers for early detection of breast cancer have failed, due to technological and methodological limitations. Clearly new approaches are warranted. We are proposing a completely novel strategy, based on the initial discovery of candidate bi- omarkers in the plasma of “avatar mice” (harboring early passage human breast cancer xenografts), and fol- lowed by biomarker triage and validation using a novel biomarker pipeline based on a targeted form of mass spectrometry (MS), multiple reaction monitoring (MRM). If successful, this study could provide a road map for applying this general approach to other cancer sites, beyond breast cancer. Briefly, candidate circulating biomarkers identified in the avatar mouse plasma will be verified in the plasma from the human patients and prioritized for further testing based on integrative proteo-genomic analyses using large breast cancer datasets generated by NCI genomic and proteomic consortia (TCGA and CPTAC). A nov- el, multiplex MRM-based assay will be developed and analytically validated (according to established fit-for- purpose guidelines) to quantify up to 50-100 prioritized biomarker candidates. Candidate biomarkers will be evaluated in an existing, strongly unbiased collection of plasma samples in which plasmas were collected prior to biopsy, compliant with PRoBE study design criteria, under an SOP from women with undiagnosed mammo- graphic lesions. Performance of the candidate biomarkers will initially be assessed in a training set (100 cas- es, 100 controls) to verify which candidates show a mean difference in plasma levels between cases vs con- trols, and to test the possibility of building a multiple marker prediction model. Subsequently, individual candi- date biomarkers (as well as a potential multiple marker prediction model) will be assessed in an independent validation set (150 cases, 150 controls) to estimate the sensitivity and specificity of the markers/panel.",Animals;Benign;Biological Assay;Biological Markers;Biopsy;Blood;Blood Tests;Breast;Breast Cancer Detection;Breast Cancer Early Detection;Cancerous;Case-Control Studies;Clinical;Collection;Complement;Data Set;Diagnosis;Diagnostic;Disease;Ductal Carcinoma;ERBB2 gene;Early Detection Research Network;Early Diagnosis;Ensure;Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay;Failure;Funding;General Population;Genomics;Goals;Guidelines;Human;In Situ;Individual;Lesion;Life;Malignant - descriptor;Malignant Neoplasms;Mammary Gland Parenchyma;Mammary Ultrasonography;Mammography;Maps;Mass Spectrum Analysis;Modeling;Mucin 1 protein;Mus;Neoplasm Transplantation;Noninfiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma;Patients;Peptides;Performance;Phase;Plasma;Procedures;Proteins;Proteomics;Research Design;Sampling;Screening for cancer;Sensitivity and Specificity;Shotguns;Specificity;Testing;The Cancer Genome Atlas;Tissues;Training;Transplantation;Triage;Tumor Markers;Validation;Woman;Xenograft procedure;abstracting;base;biomarker panel;blood-based biomarker;breast lesion;cancer biomarkers;cancer site;candidate marker;candidate validation;case control;circulating biomarkers;early detection biomarkers;human tissue;improved;malignant breast neoplasm;mortality;multiple reaction monitoring;novel;novel marker;novel strategies;patient population;population based;programs;protein biomarkers;screening;success;tumor,Michael T.

In this fifth competitive application, the GLNE continues to test the overall hypothesis that a panel of circulating and stool based biomarkers will increase the adherence to colorectal screening and in doing so reduce mortality caused by colorectal cancers. Based on the rising incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) among adults age <50 in the US, and the low compliance and high mortality in underserved populations, increased emphasis is placed on these populations. The GLNE also proposes to continue its ongoing support of EDRN discovery priorities. We propose to address the following aims: (1) Primary Aim To expand and renew the archive of appropriately preserved stool, serum, plasma, urine, tissue and DNA biospecimens to be used by EDRN investigators for current and future validation and biomarker discovery research with expanded inclusion of subjects with early-onset CRC and underserved populations. This will allow assessment of the utility of individual stool-based, and serum-based biomarkers and biomarker panels for discriminating between individuals without neoplasia (subjects both at average and higher risk for developing colon cancer), and those with colon cancer or screen-relevant neoplasia (cancer plus advanced adenoma), and construction of panels of markers to discriminate between these groups. (2) To perform validation trials of promising biomarkers discovered by EDRN investigators, external collaborating institutions and collaborating EDRN industrial partners for the early detection of colorectal neoplasia. In this context we propose to (a) to clinically validate (via a methods comparison study) the performance of a point-of-care blood- based biomarker panel with the testing of serum/plasma samples obtained in clinics serving low-income and underserved communities and (b) to clinically validate an established 4-plex stool protein panel for early diagnosis of CRC.

2U01CA152637-06,U01CA152637,8996465,2016,"Breast, Colorectal, and Ovary Cancer Clinical Validation Center","﻿ DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There remain clear clinical and public health needs to improve the early detection of breast, colorectal, and ovary cancers. For breast and colorectal cancers effective, widely used screening tests exist, but for breast cancer there remain issues with respect to optimizing mammography's use and performance, and for colorectal cancer both limited access to and the invasiveness of colonoscopy are barriers to its wider use. Ovary cancer is less common but highly lethal, and no clinically useful tests for its early detection are currently available. Through the current breast and ovary cancer EDRN Clinical Validation Center (CVC) led by Dr. Li and the current colorectal cancer EDRN Biomarker Development Laboratory (BDL) led by Dr. Lampe, we have discovered and validated promising sets of candidate early detection biomarkers for each of these three cancers that now warrant further Phase 2 and Phase 3 validation. We propose the following three projects: Project 1: Phase 3 validation of early detection biomarkers for ER+ breast cancer: Nine candidate biomarkers that have been preliminarily validated in preclinical samples will be assessed in an independent set of preclinical samples. Their intended clinical applications are to: 1. Inform timing of a subsequent mammogram in women with a negative screening mammogram; 2. Inform continuation of mammographic screening among women 75-79 years; 3. Prioritize women who should be screened with mammography in areas with limited resources. Project 2: Phase 3 validation of early detection biomarkers for colorectal cancer: We will validate five biomarkers that have been preliminarily validated in multiple sets of samples with performance that meets or exceeds those of existing fecal tests. Our intended clinical applications are to: 1. Identify people unwilling to undergo or with no access to colonoscopy who should be prioritized for colonoscopy (improve/replace existing FIT and Cologuard tests); 2. Among symptomatic patients identify those who have a very low risk of cancer and can avoid colonoscopy. Project 3: Phase 2 and 3 validation of auto- antibodies (AAb) as early detection biomarkers for serous ovarian cancer (SOC): Our overall goal is to combine novel AAb markers with currently available tests in a two-stage screening strategy with the potential to reduce ovarian cancer mortality. Our intended clinical applications are: 1. Use AAbs in conjunction with CA125 as a first line screening test; 2. Use AAbs in conjunction with HE4 for cancer early detection in women with rising CA125. In addition, we will serve as an EDRN collaborative resource providing biospecimens and expertise to support high quality PRoBE compliant EDRN discovery and validation studies across cancer types. With the combined expertise of our multidisciplinary team of investigators, this CVC will both lead well- justified, rigorously designed validation studies and provide abundant resources to EDRN. Given the strength of our biomarker candidates, the sets of biospecimens that will be used, the study designs employed, and the clearly delineated clinical applications proposed, we anticipate that this work will yield near-ter clinical impact.",Antibodies;Area;Biological Markers;Biometry;Blood;Breast;Breast Cancer Early Detection;CA-125 Antigen;Cancer Biology;Clinical;Clinical Investigator;Collaborations;Colonoscopy;Colorectal;Colorectal Cancer;Data;Data Analyses;Early Detection Research Network;Early Diagnosis;Epidemiology;Epitopes;Evaluation;Funding;Goals;Laboratories;Lead;Leadership;Longitudinal Studies;Malignant Neoplasms;Malignant neoplasm of lung;Malignant neoplasm of ovary;Malignant neoplasm of prostate;Mammographic screening;Mammography;Methodology;Monitor;Ovary;Paper;Patients;Performance;Phase;Positioning Attribute;Productivity;Public Health;Reporting;Research Design;Resources;Sampling;Screening for Ovarian Cancer;Screening for cancer;Series;Serous;Site Visit;Staging;TP53 gene;Testing;Time;Tissue Sample;Tumor Antigens;Tumor Tissue;Ultrasonography;United Kingdom;Validation;WFDC2 gene;Woman;Women&apos;s Health;Work;Writing;arm;biomarker development;biomarker discovery;cancer biomarkers;cancer risk;cancer type;candidate marker;cardiovascular health;clinical application;design;early detection biomarkers;improved;malignant breast neoplasm;meetings;mortality;multidisciplinary;novel;novel marker;oncology;phase 2 study;phase 3 study;population based;pre-clinical;public health relevance;repository;screening;success;validation studies,Charles Drescher; Paul D.

2U01CA152637-12,U01CA152637,10485810,2022,Fred Hutchinson Breast Cancer Clinical Validation Center,"ABSTRACT There remain clear clinical and public health needs to improve the early detection of breast cancer. While mammography is an effective tool, there are issues with respect to optimizing its use and performance, and despite widespread screening breast cancer remains the 2nd most common cause of cancer related death among U.S. women. Through the current EDRN Clinical Validation Center (CVC) led by Dr. Li we have validated 15 candidate biomarkers through a series of Phase 2 and Phase 3 validation studies that involved successive series of three independent sets of preclinical samples. Outside of EDRN funding, Dr. Partridge has led the development of novel strategies to improve breast cancer detection based on quantitative markers derived from screening MRIs in high-risk women and application of artificial intelligence (AI) approaches in collaboration with Microsoft. Our overarching goal is to conduct Phase 2 and 3 validation studies of blood- based biomarkers and imaging strategies that will be integrated and jointly assessed in a Phase 4 validation study. Supporting this goal we propose the following 4 projects: Project 1: Phase 3 validation of early detection biomarkers for ER+ breast cancer; Project 2: Phase 2 and 3 validation of protein biomarkers for the early detection of breast cancer discovered using a mass spectrometry-based platform; Project 3: Phase 3 validation of quantitative markers and AI algorithms applied to MRI screening exams for the early detection of breast cancer in women at high risk; and Project 4: Phase 4 validation of blood-based biomarkers and imaging algorithms for the early detection of breast cancer.

3U01CA152637-10S1,U01CA152637,10375663,2021,"Breast, Colorectal, and Ovary Cancer Clinical Validation Center","﻿ DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There remain clear clinical and public health needs to improve the early detection of breast, colorectal, and ovary cancers. For breast and colorectal cancers effective, widely used screening tests exist, but for breast cancer there remain issues with respect to optimizing mammography's use and performance, and for colorectal cancer both limited access to and the invasiveness of colonoscopy are barriers to its wider use. Ovary cancer is less common but highly lethal, and no clinically useful tests for its early detection are currently available. Through the current breast and ovary cancer EDRN Clinical Validation Center (CVC) led by Dr. Li and the current colorectal cancer EDRN Biomarker Development Laboratory (BDL) led by Dr. Lampe, we have discovered and validated promising sets of candidate early detection biomarkers for each of these three cancers that now warrant further Phase 2 and Phase 3 validation. We propose the following three projects: Project 1: Phase 3 validation of early detection biomarkers for ER+ breast cancer: Nine candidate biomarkers that have been preliminarily validated in preclinical samples will be assessed in an independent set of preclinical samples. Their intended clinical applications are to: 1. Inform timing of a subsequent mammogram in women with a negative screening mammogram; 2. Inform continuation of mammographic screening among women 75-79 years; 3. Prioritize women who should be screened with mammography in areas with limited resources. Project 2: Phase 3 validation of early detection biomarkers for colorectal cancer: We will validate five biomarkers that have been preliminarily validated in multiple sets of samples with performance that meets or exceeds those of existing fecal tests. Our intended clinical applications are to: 1. Identify people unwilling to undergo or with no access to colonoscopy who should be prioritized for colonoscopy (improve/replace existing FIT and Cologuard tests); 2. Among symptomatic patients identify those who have a very low risk of cancer and can avoid colonoscopy. Project 3: Phase 2 and 3 validation of auto- antibodies (AAb) as early detection biomarkers for serous ovarian cancer (SOC): Our overall goal is to combine novel AAb markers with currently available tests in a two-stage screening strategy with the potential to reduce ovarian cancer mortality. Our intended clinical applications are: 1. Use AAbs in conjunction with CA125 as a first line screening test; 2. Use AAbs in conjunction with HE4 for cancer early detection in women with rising CA125. In addition, we will serve as an EDRN collaborative resource providing biospecimens and expertise to support high quality PRoBE compliant EDRN discovery and validation studies across cancer types. With the combined expertise of our multidisciplinary team of investigators, this CVC will both lead well- justified, rigorously designed validation studies and provide abundant resources to EDRN.

3U01CA214172-05S1,U01CA214172,10462864,2021,A unique approach combining avatar mice and targeted mass spectrometry to identify blood biomarkers for early detection of breast cancer,"Project Summary/Abstract Tens of millions of women undergo population-based screening for breast cancer by mammography. De- spite the life-saving potential of early detection, screening guidelines for mammography are controversial and continue to evolve. At issue are the specificity of mammography for distinguishing benign vs cancerous le- sions, the sensitivity of mammography in some patient populations (e.g. women with dense breasts), and con- cerns regarding over-diagnosis (e.g. some ductal carcinoma in situ). Our ultimate clinical aim is to develop a blood test for early detection of breast cancer that can be used in conjunction with mammography to improve sensitivity and specificity during screening, and thus have enormous clinical impact by detecting treatable can- cers missed by mammography (reducing mortality) and by avoiding unnecessary invasive procedures for be- nign or non-life-threatening disease. Despite considerable effort, attempts to identify blood-based screening biomarkers for early detection of breast cancer have failed, due to technological and methodological limitations. Clearly new approaches are warranted. We are proposing a completely novel strategy, based on the initial discovery of candidate bi- omarkers in the plasma of “avatar mice” (harboring early passage human breast cancer xenografts), and fol- lowed by biomarker triage and validation using a novel biomarker pipeline based on a targeted form of mass spectrometry (MS), multiple reaction monitoring (MRM). If successful, this study could provide a road map for applying this general approach to other cancer sites, beyond breast cancer. Briefly, candidate circulating biomarkers identified in the avatar mouse plasma will be verified in the plasma from the human patients and prioritized for further testing based on integrative proteo-genomic analyses using large breast cancer datasets generated by NCI genomic and proteomic consortia (TCGA and CPTAC). A nov- el, multiplex MRM-based assay will be developed and analytically validated (according to established fit-for- purpose guidelines) to quantify up to 50-100 prioritized biomarker candidates. Candidate biomarkers will be evaluated in an existing, strongly unbiased collection of plasma samples in which plasmas were collected prior to biopsy, compliant with PRoBE study design criteria, under an SOP from women with undiagnosed mammo- graphic lesions. Performance of the candidate biomarkers will initially be assessed in a training set (100 cas- es, 100 controls) to verify which candidates show a mean difference in plasma levels between cases vs con- trols, and to test the possibility of building a multiple marker prediction model. Subsequently, individual candi- date biomarkers (as well as a potential multiple marker prediction model) will be assessed in an independent validation set (150 cases, 150 controls) to estimate the sensitivity and specificity of the markers/panel.",Animals;Benign;Biological Assay;Biological Markers;Biopsy;Blood;Blood Tests;Breast;Breast Cancer Detection;Breast Cancer Early Detection;Cancerous;Case-Control Studies;Clinical;Collection;Complement;Data Set;Diagnosis;Disease;ERBB2 gene;Early Detection Research Network;Early Diagnosis;Ensure;Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay;Estrogen receptor positive;Failure;Funding;General Population;Genomics;Goals;Guidelines;Human;Individual;Isotopes;Lesion;Life;Malignant - descriptor;Malignant Neoplasms;Mammary Gland Parenchyma;Mammographic screening;Mammography;Maps;Mass Spectrum Analysis;Methodology;Mucin 1 protein;Mus;Neoplasm Transplantation;Noninfiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma;Patients;Peptides;Performance;Phase;Plasma;Procedures;Proteins;Proteomics;Research Design;Sampling;Savings;Screening for cancer;Sensitivity and Specificity;Shotguns;Specificity;Testing;The Cancer Genome Atlas;Tissues;Training;Transplantation;Triage;Tumor Markers;Ultrasonography;Validation;Woman;Xenograft procedure;base;biomarker panel;blood-based biomarker;breast lesion;cancer biomarkers;cancer site;candidate marker;candidate validation;case control;circulating biomarkers;clinical diagnostics;early detection biomarkers;early screening;human tissue;improved;malignant breast neoplasm;mortality;multiple reaction monitoring;multiplex assay;novel;novel marker;novel strategies;patient population;population based;predictive modeling;protein biomarkers;screening;screening guidelines;screening program;success;tumor,Michael T.

5U01CA086400-22,U01CA086400,10698103,2023,Great Lakes New England Clinical Validation Center,"The Great Lakes New England Clinical Validation Center (GLNE CVC), a Clinical Validation Consortium component of the Early Detection Research Network (EDRN) is a highly collaborative group of investigators whose aims to validate biomarkers for the early detection and risk assessment of cancers of the gastrointestinal tract. In this fifth competitive application, the GLNE continues to test the overall hypothesis that a panel of circulating and stool based biomarkers will increase the adherence to colorectal screening and in doing so reduce mortality caused by colorectal cancers. Based on the rising incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) among adults age <50 in the US, and the low compliance and high mortality in underserved populations, increased emphasis is placed on these populations. The GLNE also proposes to continue its ongoing support of EDRN discovery priorities. We propose to address the following aims: (1) Primary Aim To expand and renew the archive of appropriately preserved stool, serum, plasma, urine, tissue and DNA biospecimens to be used by EDRN investigators for current and future validation and biomarker discovery research with expanded inclusion of subjects with early-onset CRC and underserved populations. This will allow assessment of the utility of individual stool-based, and serum-based biomarkers and biomarker panels for discriminating between individuals without neoplasia (subjects both at average and higher risk for developing colon cancer), and those with colon cancer or screen-relevant neoplasia (cancer plus advanced adenoma), and construction of panels of markers to discriminate between these groups. (2) To perform validation trials of promising biomarkers discovered by EDRN investigators, external collaborating institutions and collaborating EDRN industrial partners for the early detection of colorectal neoplasia. In this context we propose to (a) to clinically validate (via a methods comparison study) the performance of a point-of-care blood- based biomarker panel with the testing of serum/plasma samples obtained in clinics serving low-income and underserved communities and (b) to clinically validate an established 4-plex stool protein panel for early diagnosis of CRC. (3) To follow prospectively subjects enrolled in an established prospective Phase 2 validation trial to identify pre-diagnostic specimens which may be used to develop predictive markers.",Address;Adenocarcinoma;Adherence;Adult;African American population;Age;Archives;Biological Markers;Blood;Clinic;Clinical;Clinical Data;Collaborations;Colon;Colon Carcinoma;Colonoscopy;Colorectal;Colorectal Cancer;Colorectal Neoplasms;DNA;Development;Diagnostic;Early Detection Research Network;Early Diagnosis;Enrollment;Feces;Future;High grade dysplasia;Incidence;Individual;Industrialization;Institution;Link;Low income;Malignant Neoplasms;Malignant neoplasm of gastrointestinal tract;Methods;Morbidity - disease rate;Neoplasms;New England;Participant;Patients;Performance;Phase;Plasma;Population;Prevalence;Procedures;Proteins;Research;Research Personnel;Risk Assessment;Sampling;Serum;Specimen;Testing;Tissues;Tubulovillous Adenoma;Underserved Population;Urine;Validation;Villous Adenoma;adenoma;biomarker discovery;biomarker panel;biomarker validation;blood-based biomarker;candidate marker;circulating biomarkers;colorectal cancer screening;cost;early detection biomarkers;early onset colorectal cancer;follow-up;high risk;mortality;point of care;predictive marker;preservation;prospective;response;sample collection;screening;sex;stool sample;underserved community,Robert S Bresalier; Sapna Syngal,Matthew R Young,1016923,1016923,2023-09-08T12:09:00Z,2000-05-15T12:05:00Z,2027-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-21-033,nofo_CA-21-033,university of tx md anderson can ctr,HOUSTON,TX,UNITED STATES,edrn,org_name,False

For breast and colorectal cancers effective, widely used screening tests exist, but for breast cancer there remain issues with respect to optimizing mammography's use and performance, and for colorectal cancer both limited access to and the invasiveness of colonoscopy are barriers to its wider use. Ovary cancer is less common but highly lethal, and no clinically useful tests for its early detection are currently available. Through the current breast and ovary cancer EDRN Clinical Validation Center (CVC) led by Dr. Li and the current colorectal cancer EDRN Biomarker Development Laboratory (BDL) led by Dr. Lampe, we have discovered and validated promising sets of candidate early detection biomarkers for each of these three cancers that now warrant further Phase 2 and Phase 3 validation. We propose the following three projects: Project 1: Phase 3 validation of early detection biomarkers for ER+ breast cancer: Nine candidate biomarkers that have been preliminarily validated in preclinical samples will be assessed in an independent set of preclinical samples. Their intended clinical applications are to: 1. Inform timing of a subsequent mammogram in women with a negative screening mammogram; 2. Inform continuation of mammographic screening among women 75-79 years; 3. Prioritize women who should be screened with mammography in areas with limited resources. Project 2: Phase 3 validation of early detection biomarkers for colorectal cancer: We will validate five biomarkers that have been preliminarily validated in multiple sets of samples with performance that meets or exceeds those of existing fecal tests. Our intended clinical applications are to: 1. Identify people unwilling to undergo or with no access to colonoscopy who should be prioritized for colonoscopy (improve/replace existing FIT and Cologuard tests); 2. Among symptomatic patients identify those who have a very low risk of cancer and can avoid colonoscopy. Project 3: Phase 2 and 3 validation of auto- antibodies (AAb) as early detection biomarkers for serous ovarian cancer (SOC): Our overall goal is to combine novel AAb markers with currently available tests in a two-stage screening strategy with the potential to reduce ovarian cancer mortality. Our intended clinical applications are: 1. Use AAbs in conjunction with CA125 as a first line screening test; 2. Use AAbs in conjunction with HE4 for cancer early detection in women with rising CA125. In addition, we will serve as an EDRN collaborative resource providing biospecimens and expertise to support high quality PRoBE compliant EDRN discovery and validation studies across cancer types. With the combined expertise of our multidisciplinary team of investigators, this CVC will both lead well- justified, rigorously designed validation studies and provide abundant resources to EDRN. Given the strength of our biomarker candidates, the sets of biospecimens that will be used, the study designs employed, and the clearly delineated clinical applications proposed, we anticipate that this work will yield near-ter clinical impact.",Area;Autoantibodies;Biological Markers;Biometry;Blood;Breast;Breast Cancer Early Detection;CA-125 Antigen;Cancer Biology;Clinical;Collaborations;Colonoscopy;Colorectal;Colorectal Cancer;Data;Data Analyses;Early Detection Research Network;Early Diagnosis;Epidemiology;Epitopes;Evaluation;Funding;Goals;Interdisciplinary Study;Lead;Leadership;Malignant Neoplasms;Malignant neoplasm of lung;Malignant neoplasm of ovary;Malignant neoplasm of prostate;Mammographic screening;Mammography;Methodology;Molecular Conformation;Monitor;Ovary;Paper;Patients;Performance;Phase;Positioning Attribute;Productivity;Public Health;Reporting;Research Design;Research Personnel;Resources;Sampling;Screening for Ovarian Cancer;Screening for cancer;Series;Serous;Site Visit;TP53 gene;Testing;Tissue Sample;Tumor Antigens;Tumor Tissue;Ultrasonography;United Kingdom;Validation;WFDC2 gene;Woman;Women&apos;s Health;Work;arm;biomarker development;biomarker discovery;cancer biomarkers;cancer risk;cancer type;candidate marker;cardiovascular health;clinical application;design;early detection biomarkers;improved;laboratory development;malignant breast neoplasm;mortality;multidisciplinary;multimodality;novel;novel marker;oncology;phase 2 study;phase 3 study;population based;pre-clinical;public health relevance;repository;screening;success;validation studies,Charles Drescher; Paul D.

5U01CA152637-13,U01CA152637,10676289,2023,Fred Hutchinson Breast Cancer Clinical Validation Center,"ABSTRACT There remain clear clinical and public health needs to improve the early detection of breast cancer. While mammography is an effective tool, there are issues with respect to optimizing its use and performance, and despite widespread screening breast cancer remains the 2nd most common cause of cancer related death among U.S. women. Through the current EDRN Clinical Validation Center (CVC) led by Dr. Li we have validated 15 candidate biomarkers through a series of Phase 2 and Phase 3 validation studies that involved successive series of three independent sets of preclinical samples. Outside of EDRN funding, Dr. Partridge has led the development of novel strategies to improve breast cancer detection based on quantitative markers derived from screening MRIs in high-risk women and application of artificial intelligence (AI) approaches in collaboration with Microsoft. Our overarching goal is to conduct Phase 2 and 3 validation studies of blood- based biomarkers and imaging strategies that will be integrated and jointly assessed in a Phase 4 validation study. Supporting this goal we propose the following 4 projects: Project 1: Phase 3 validation of early detection biomarkers for ER+ breast cancer; Project 2: Phase 2 and 3 validation of protein biomarkers for the early detection of breast cancer discovered using a mass spectrometry-based platform; Project 3: Phase 3 validation of quantitative markers and AI algorithms applied to MRI screening exams for the early detection of breast cancer in women at high risk; and Project 4: Phase 4 validation of blood-based biomarkers and imaging algorithms for the early detection of breast cancer. Additionally, we will provide biospecimens and expertise to support high quality PRoBE compliant EDRN discovery and validation studies across several cancer types. With the combined expertise of our multidisciplinary team of investigators and our engagement with key commercial partners, this CVC will both lead well-justified, rigorously designed validation studies and provide abundant resources to EDRN. Given the strength of our biomarker candidates, the sets of biospecimens that will be used, the study designs employed, and the clearly delineated clinical applications proposed, we anticipate that this work will yield near-term clinical impact.",Algorithms;Area;Artificial Intelligence;Biological Assay;Biological Markers;Biological Specimen Banks;Biometry;Blood;Blood specimen;Breast;Breast Cancer Detection;Breast Cancer Early Detection;Breast Cancer Risk Factor;Breast Magnetic Resonance Imaging;CLIA certified;Cancer Biology;Cancer Etiology;Cessation of life;Clinical;Collaborations;Colorectal;Colorectal Cancer;Computers;Data;Development;Diagnostic;Early Detection Research Network;Epidemiology;Estrogen receptor positive;Funding;Future;Goals;High Risk Woman;Image;Lead;Leadership;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Malignant neoplasm of lung;Malignant neoplasm of ovary;Malignant neoplasm of prostate;Mammographic screening;Mammography;Mass Spectrum Analysis;Methodology;Oncology;Ovary;Paper;Patients;Performance;Phase;Positioning Attribute;Prospective cohort;Public Health;Research Design;Research Personnel;Resources;Sampling;Scientist;Series;Techniques;Testing;Tissue Sample;Tumor Tissue;Universities;Validation;Washington;Woman;Women&apos;s Health;Work;artificial intelligence algorithm;biomarker development;biomarker panel;blood-based biomarker;breast imaging;cancer biomarkers;cancer type;candidate marker;clinical application;clinical development;cohort;design;design verification;early detection biomarkers;good laboratory practice;high risk;improved;industry partner;magnetic resonance imaging biomarker;malignant breast neoplasm;multidisciplinary;multimodality;novel;novel strategies;patient screening;phase 2 study;phase 3 study;phase 3 testing;phase 4 study;pre-clinical;predictive modeling;prospective;protein biomarkers;screening;tool;validation studies,Christopher I Li; Savannah Corrina Partridge,Sidney Wang Fu,1060017,1060017,2023-06-26T12:06:00Z,2010-08-16T12:08:00Z,2027-07-31T12:07:00Z,RFA-CA-21-033,nofo_CA-21-033,fred hutchinson cancer center,Seattle,WA,UNITED STATES,edrn,org_name,False

De- spite the life-saving potential of early detection, screening guidelines for mammography are controversial and continue to evolve. At issue are the specificity of mammography for distinguishing benign vs cancerous le- sions, the sensitivity of mammography in some patient populations (e.g. women with dense breasts), and con- cerns regarding over-diagnosis (e.g. some ductal carcinoma in situ). Our ultimate clinical aim is to develop a blood test for early detection of breast cancer that can be used in conjunction with mammography to improve sensitivity and specificity during screening, and thus have enormous clinical impact by detecting treatable can- cers missed by mammography (reducing mortality) and by avoiding unnecessary invasive procedures for be- nign or non-life-threatening disease. Despite considerable effort, attempts to identify blood-based screening biomarkers for early detection of breast cancer have failed, due to technological and methodological limitations. Clearly new approaches are warranted. We are proposing a completely novel strategy, based on the initial discovery of candidate bi- omarkers in the plasma of “avatar mice” (harboring early passage human breast cancer xenografts), and fol- lowed by biomarker triage and validation using a novel biomarker pipeline based on a targeted form of mass spectrometry (MS), multiple reaction monitoring (MRM). If successful, this study could provide a road map for applying this general approach to other cancer sites, beyond breast cancer. Briefly, candidate circulating biomarkers identified in the avatar mouse plasma will be verified in the plasma from the human patients and prioritized for further testing based on integrative proteo-genomic analyses using large breast cancer datasets generated by NCI genomic and proteomic consortia (TCGA and CPTAC). A nov- el, multiplex MRM-based assay will be developed and analytically validated (according to established fit-for- purpose guidelines) to quantify up to 50-100 prioritized biomarker candidates. Candidate biomarkers will be evaluated in an existing, strongly unbiased collection of plasma samples in which plasmas were collected prior to biopsy, compliant with PRoBE study design criteria, under an SOP from women with undiagnosed mammo- graphic lesions. Performance of the candidate biomarkers will initially be assessed in a training set (100 cas- es, 100 controls) to verify which candidates show a mean difference in plasma levels between cases vs con- trols, and to test the possibility of building a multiple marker prediction model. Subsequently, individual candi- date biomarkers (as well as a potential multiple marker prediction model) will be assessed in an independent validation set (150 cases, 150 controls) to estimate the sensitivity and specificity of the markers/panel.",Animals;Benign;Biological Assay;Biological Markers;Biopsy;Blood;Blood Tests;Breast;Breast Cancer Detection;Breast Cancer Early Detection;Cancerous;Case-Control Studies;Clinical;Collection;Complement;Data Set;Diagnosis;Disease;ERBB2 gene;Early Detection Research Network;Early Diagnosis;Ensure;Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay;Failure;Funding;General Population;Genomics;Goals;Guidelines;Human;Individual;Isotopes;Lesion;Life;Malignant - descriptor;Malignant Neoplasms;Mammary Gland Parenchyma;Mammography;Maps;Mass Spectrum Analysis;Methodology;Modeling;Mucin 1 protein;Mus;Neoplasm Transplantation;Noninfiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma;Patients;Peptides;Performance;Phase;Plasma;Procedures;Proteins;Proteomics;Research Design;Sampling;Savings;Screening for cancer;Sensitivity and Specificity;Shotguns;Specificity;Testing;The Cancer Genome Atlas;Tissues;Training;Transplantation;Triage;Tumor Markers;Ultrasonography;Validation;Woman;Xenograft procedure;base;biomarker panel;blood-based biomarker;breast lesion;cancer biomarkers;cancer site;candidate marker;candidate validation;case control;circulating biomarkers;clinical diagnostics;early detection biomarkers;human tissue;improved;malignant breast neoplasm;mortality;multiple reaction monitoring;novel;novel marker;novel strategies;patient population;population based;programs;protein biomarkers;screening;success;tumor,Michael T.

6U01CA152637-11,U01CA152637,10609257,2020,"Breast, Colorectal, and Ovary Cancer Clinical Validation Center","﻿ DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There remain clear clinical and public health needs to improve the early detection of breast, colorectal, and ovary cancers. For breast and colorectal cancers effective, widely used screening tests exist, but for breast cancer there remain issues with respect to optimizing mammography's use and performance, and for colorectal cancer both limited access to and the invasiveness of colonoscopy are barriers to its wider use. Ovary cancer is less common but highly lethal, and no clinically useful tests for its early detection are currently available. Through the current breast and ovary cancer EDRN Clinical Validation Center (CVC) led by Dr. Li and the current colorectal cancer EDRN Biomarker Development Laboratory (BDL) led by Dr. Lampe, we have discovered and validated promising sets of candidate early detection biomarkers for each of these three cancers that now warrant further Phase 2 and Phase 3 validation. We propose the following three projects: Project 1: Phase 3 validation of early detection biomarkers for ER+ breast cancer: Nine candidate biomarkers that have been preliminarily validated in preclinical samples will be assessed in an independent set of preclinical samples. Their intended clinical applications are to: 1. Inform timing of a subsequent mammogram in women with a negative screening mammogram; 2. Inform continuation of mammographic screening among women 75-79 years; 3. Prioritize women who should be screened with mammography in areas with limited resources. Project 2: Phase 3 validation of early detection biomarkers for colorectal cancer: We will validate five biomarkers that have been preliminarily validated in multiple sets of samples with performance that meets or exceeds those of existing fecal tests. Our intended clinical applications are to: 1. Identify people unwilling to undergo or with no access to colonoscopy who should be prioritized for colonoscopy (improve/replace existing FIT and Cologuard tests); 2. Among symptomatic patients identify those who have a very low risk of cancer and can avoid colonoscopy. Project 3: Phase 2 and 3 validation of auto- antibodies (AAb) as early detection biomarkers for serous ovarian cancer (SOC): Our overall goal is to combine novel AAb markers with currently available tests in a two-stage screening strategy with the potential to reduce ovarian cancer mortality. Our intended clinical applications are: 1. Use AAbs in conjunction with CA125 as a first line screening test; 2. Use AAbs in conjunction with HE4 for cancer early detection in women with rising CA125. In addition, we will serve as an EDRN collaborative resource providing biospecimens and expertise to support high quality PRoBE compliant EDRN discovery and validation studies across cancer types. With the combined expertise of our multidisciplinary team of investigators, this CVC will both lead well- justified, rigorously designed validation studies and provide abundant resources to EDRN. Given the strength of our biomarker candidates, the sets of biospecimens that will be used, the study designs employed, and the clearly delineated clinical applications proposed, we anticipate that this work will yield near-ter clinical impact.",,Charles Drescher; Paul D.

6U01CA214172-06,U01CA214172,10663662,2020,A unique approach combining avatar mice and targeted mass spectrometry to identify blood biomarkers for early detection of breast cancer,"Project Summary/Abstract Tens of millions of women undergo population-based screening for breast cancer by mammography. De- spite the life-saving potential of early detection, screening guidelines for mammography are controversial and continue to evolve. At issue are the specificity of mammography for distinguishing benign vs cancerous le- sions, the sensitivity of mammography in some patient populations (e.g. women with dense breasts), and con- cerns regarding over-diagnosis (e.g. some ductal carcinoma in situ). Our ultimate clinical aim is to develop a blood test for early detection of breast cancer that can be used in conjunction with mammography to improve sensitivity and specificity during screening, and thus have enormous clinical impact by detecting treatable can- cers missed by mammography (reducing mortality) and by avoiding unnecessary invasive procedures for be- nign or non-life-threatening disease. Despite considerable effort, attempts to identify blood-based screening biomarkers for early detection of breast cancer have failed, due to technological and methodological limitations. Clearly new approaches are warranted. We are proposing a completely novel strategy, based on the initial discovery of candidate bi- omarkers in the plasma of “avatar mice” (harboring early passage human breast cancer xenografts), and fol- lowed by biomarker triage and validation using a novel biomarker pipeline based on a targeted form of mass spectrometry (MS), multiple reaction monitoring (MRM). If successful, this study could provide a road map for applying this general approach to other cancer sites, beyond breast cancer. Briefly, candidate circulating biomarkers identified in the avatar mouse plasma will be verified in the plasma from the human patients and prioritized for further testing based on integrative proteo-genomic analyses using large breast cancer datasets generated by NCI genomic and proteomic consortia (TCGA and CPTAC). A nov- el, multiplex MRM-based assay will be developed and analytically validated (according to established fit-for- purpose guidelines) to quantify up to 50-100 prioritized biomarker candidates. Candidate biomarkers will be evaluated in an existing, strongly unbiased collection of plasma samples in which plasmas were collected prior to biopsy, compliant with PRoBE study design criteria, under an SOP from women with undiagnosed mammo- graphic lesions. Performance of the candidate biomarkers will initially be assessed in a training set (100 cas- es, 100 controls) to verify which candidates show a mean difference in plasma levels between cases vs con- trols, and to test the possibility of building a multiple marker prediction model. Subsequently, individual candi- date biomarkers (as well as a potential multiple marker prediction model) will be assessed in an independent validation set (150 cases, 150 controls) to estimate the sensitivity and specificity of the markers/panel.",,Michael T.

Given the increasing median age of the US population, the number of breast cancers diagnosed in older women is expected to rise by 50% in the coming decades. Older women with breast cancer experience worse breast cancer-specific outcomes as compared to younger women, under-treatment is likely to play a central role. Studies have demonstrated that breast cancer patients who receive <85% of received dose intensity (RDI), a metric that combines the total dose administered with adherence to the planned treatment schedule, have a 57% increase in the risk of disease recurrence at 10 years as compared to women who receive at least 85% RDI. Only 50-76% of breast cancer patients >65 receive an RDI >85, largely due to increased toxicity of therapy in these patients. Reducing treatment-related toxicity to enhance RDI is critical to improving disease outcomes among the growing population of older breast cancer patients. To this end, models predicting for severe chemotoxicity demonstrate that a number of potentially modifiable factors (commonly assessed as part of the geriatric assessment), are important determinants of chemotoxicity, including function, depression, and falls (or use of assistive devices). Exercise has a significant positive impact on each of these modifiable factors, in the general population and in cancer patients. However, data on the ability of exercise interventions to improve treatment tolerance and preserve dose intensity among older breast cancer patients are lacking. We propose a randomized controlled trial to assess the effects of a multicomponent, hybrid telehealth (TH) exercise and protein intake support (the THRIVE Intervention) on RDI, incidence and severity of chemotoxicities, functional status, muscle mass, and patient reported outcomes in 270 breast cancer patients age ≥ 65 receiving neo/adjuvant chemotherapy. Participants will be randomized to the THRIVE Intervention or to a Health Education and Support control group. The intervention will be delivered through a hybrid model, leveraging the existing Breast Cancer Weight Loss (BWEL) Trial call center. After 2 in-person, onsite exercise sessions, we will transition to TH sessions delivered on study provided tablets, by certified exercise coaches who will tailor behavior change to support adherence relative to symptom burden. To optimize intervention effectiveness, participants will undergo a TH evaluation of diet adequacy with a registered dietitian, focused on optimal daily protein intake. Protein supplementation will be provided if needed to achieve 1.2 gm/kg daily intake. The TH focus consolidates expertise at a well-established call center (BWEL), elevating the potential for broad implementation across the U.S., including cancer treatment centers with too few patients to justify necessary personnel.

1U01CA132194-01,U01CA132194,7391358,2008,Early Clinical Trials of New Anti-Cancer Agents with Phase I Emphasis (U01),"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this application is to develop and perform early clinical trials with new anti-cancer agents sponsored by the NCI Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program. Discovery and clinical evaluation of new anti- cancer agents is one of the highest strategic objectives of the Cancer Institute of New Jersey (CINJ), the only NCI-designated comprehensive cancer center in New Jersey. From its inception, CINJ has focused on development of early clinical trials with a translational emphasis. CINJ clinical investigators have an outstanding record of translational clinical trial development, including pharmacokinetic/biomarker studies in several phase I/pilot trials supported by grants from the NCI. This expertise encompasses a wide range of drug targets, including cellular signaling pathways as well as novel immunologic, DNA-, and microtubule- associated targets. From 2004-2006, 42 phase I or pilot trials were active at CINJ, with an average annual accrual of 151 patients to these trials. Scientific themes within these studies included statistically driven dose- and schedule-finding algorithms, as well as validation of target modulation by biochemical studies of cancer tissues. CINJ provides an exceptional and unique resource for early clinical trials of new anti-cancer agents. Expected to reach a population of 9,000,000 by 2008, New Jersey has the highest population density in the United States, with an average of 1,174 people per square mile, which is 13 times the national average. Approximately 70,000 patient visits occur yearly at the main CINJ facility, and over 6000 new patients are seen each year. A statewide network of affiliated institutions facilitates referral for early clinical trials. CINJ has an outstanding clinical research infrastructure provided by several Shared Resources, including Biometrics, Centralized Education and Training Services for Clinical Research Personnel, Office of Human Research Services, Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics, Research Pharmacy, and Tissue Retrieval Services. Clinical informatics resources include electronic order entry, electronic clinical documentation, and a web-based clinical trials database that allows online monitoring of trial development, accrual, adverse events, and responses, as well as electronic data sharing with NCI trial monitoring systems.",Adverse event;Algorithms;Antineoplastic Agents;Biochemical;Biological Markers;Biometry;Cancer Institute of New Jersey;Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program;Clinical;Clinical Informatics;Clinical Investigator;Clinical Research;Clinical Trials;Clinical Trials Database;Comprehensive Cancer Center;DNA;Data;Development;Documentation;Dose;Drug Delivery Systems;Drug Kinetics;Electronics;Goals;Grant;Health Services Research;Human;Immunologics;Institution;Malignant Neoplasms;Microtubules;Monitor;New Jersey;Online Systems;Patients;Pharmacodynamics;Pharmacy facility;Phase;Population;Population Density;Range;Research;Research Infrastructure;Research Personnel;Resource Informatics;Resource Sharing;Resources;Retrieval;Schedule;Services;Signal Pathway;System;Time;Tissues;Training and Education;United States;Validation;Visit;novel;pilot trial;research clinical testing;response;translational clinical trial,Robert S.

2U01CA069853-09,U01CA069853,6581582,2003,Phase I Clinical Trials of Anti-Cancer Agents,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal entitled, ""Phase I Clinical Trials of Anti-Cancer Agents,"" prepared in response to RFA No. CA-02-011, requests support for early stage clinical evaluations, particularly phase I, pharmacological and relevant biological studies, of investigational anti-cancer therapeutics. The greatest advances in the cancer therapy have resulted from the introduction of novel anti-cancer therapeutics and their subsequent optimization (i.e. dosing, scheduling, sequencing, deployment in combination) for clinical practice. The phase I stage represents a crucial step in this developmental process, and the reliability of clinical and supportive pharmacological and biological data may significantly impact on the expedient and optimal development of new therapies. This is especially true for selective rationally-designed, target-based agents. The sheer number investigational candidates is striking relative to available developmental resources, and prioritization of these resources by considering the ultimate impact of the therapeutic represent major developmental challenges that must be overcome. Furthermore, unlike nonspecific cytotoxics, in which anti-cancer activity is often dose-related and, hence, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is generally sought, the preponderance of preclinical data with selective target-based therapeutics suggest that maximal biological effects will occur at doses that are substantially lower than the MTD. Selection of a maximal biological dose would likely result in greater therapeutic indices and more ""breathing room"" for combination development. The preponderance of preclinical data also suggests that the predominant beneficial effects of target-based therapeutics will be tumor growth inhibition, which may not be appreciated in nonrandomized studies. This proposal will describe the San Antonio Drug Development Group's (SADDG) approach to meet these challenges. The specific aims are directed at discerning both traditional phase I study endpoints (e.g. MTD, characterization of toxicity) and relevant biological and pharmacological endpoints (e.g. maximally effective dose.) The latter is particularly important in view of the expectations that many novel anti-cancer agents may not have clear toxicological endpoints, and the prospects for clinical utility may not be known until further evaluations have been completed. Therefore, other specific aims, including the assessment of relevant biological activity at the target level, are of utmost importance to ultimately optimize the therapeutic indices of investigational cancer therapies. The SADDG proposes to perform rigorous and comprehensive toxicological, pharmacological, and biological evaluations in the course of early clinical trials. The results will be synthesized to address therapeutic optimization issues, ascertain proof of principle, and develop assays to discern the relevant effects of the therapy on the target. The development of such assays may be even more crucial for subsequent disease-directed studies to gauge biological targeting and/or tumor growth inhibition in vivo. In addition to the methodology proposed to meet these challenges, the proposal will demonstrate the immense experience, success, and dedication of the SADDG to the comprehensive development of anti-cancer therapeutics, as well as the strong institutional commitment.",antineoplastics; capillary electrophoresis; clinical research; clinical trial phase I; combination cancer therapy; cooperative study; cytotoxicity; dosage; drug interactions; drug screening /evaluation; gas chromatography; high performance liquid chromatography; human subject; human therapy evaluation; neoplasm /cancer chemotherapy; neoplasm /cancer pharmacology; patient oriented research; pharmacokinetics; radioimmunoassay,Eric K Rowinsky,Leeann T Jensen,486569,486569,,1995-07-01T12:07:00Z,2004-02-29T12:02:00Z,RFA-CA-02-011,nofo_CA-02-011,cancer therapy and research center,SAN ANTONIO,TX,UNITED STATES,etctn,org_name,False

The greatest advances in the cancer therapy have resulted from the introduction of novel anti-cancer therapeutics and their subsequent optimization (i.e. dosing, scheduling, sequencing, deployment in combination) for clinical practice. The phase I stage represents a crucial step in this developmental process, and the reliability of clinical and supportive pharmacological and biological data may significantly impact on the expedient and optimal development of new therapies. This is especially true for selective rationally-designed, target-based agents. The sheer number investigational candidates is striking relative to available developmental resources, and prioritization of these resources by considering the ultimate impact of the therapeutic represent major developmental challenges that must be overcome. Furthermore, unlike nonspecific cytotoxics, in which anti-cancer activity is often dose-related and, hence, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is generally sought, the preponderance of preclinical data with selective target-based therapeutics suggest that maximal biological effects will occur at doses that are substantially lower than the MTD. Selection of a maximal biological dose would likely result in greater therapeutic indices and more ""breathing room"" for combination development. The preponderance of preclinical data also suggests that the predominant beneficial effects of target-based therapeutics will be tumor growth inhibition, which may not be appreciated in nonrandomized studies. This proposal will describe the San Antonio Drug Development Group's (SADDG) approach to meet these challenges. The specific aims are directed at discerning both traditional phase I study endpoints (e.g. MTD, characterization of toxicity) and relevant biological and pharmacological endpoints (e.g. maximally effective dose.) The latter is particularly important in view of the expectations that many novel anti-cancer agents may not have clear toxicological endpoints, and the prospects for clinical utility may not be known until further evaluations have been completed. Therefore, other specific aims, including the assessment of relevant biological activity at the target level, are of utmost importance to ultimately optimize the therapeutic indices of investigational cancer therapies. The SADDG proposes to perform rigorous and comprehensive toxicological, pharmacological, and biological evaluations in the course of early clinical trials. The results will be synthesized to address therapeutic optimization issues, ascertain proof of principle, and develop assays to discern the relevant effects of the therapy on the target. The development of such assays may be even more crucial for subsequent disease-directed studies to gauge biological targeting and/or tumor growth inhibition in vivo. In addition to the methodology proposed to meet these challenges, the proposal will demonstrate the immense experience, success, and dedication of the SADDG to the comprehensive development of anti-cancer therapeutics, as well as the strong institutional commitment.",antineoplastics;capillary electrophoresis;clinical research;clinical trial phase I;combination cancer therapy;cooperative study;cytotoxicity;dosage;drug interactions;drug screening /evaluation;gas chromatography;high performance liquid chromatography;human subject;human therapy evaluation;neoplasm /cancer chemotherapy;neoplasm /cancer pharmacology;patient oriented research;pharmacokinetics;radioimmunoassay,Anthony W Tolcher,Leeann T Jensen,492039,492039,2004-03-29T12:03:00Z,1995-07-01T12:07:00Z,2008-02-29T12:02:00Z,RFA-CA-02-011,nofo_CA-02-011,cancer therapy and research center,SAN ANTONIO,TX,UNITED STATES,etctn,org_name,False

Discovery and clinical evaluation of new anti- cancer agents is one of the highest strategic objectives of the Cancer Institute of New Jersey (CINJ), the only NCI-designated comprehensive cancer center in New Jersey. From its inception, CINJ has focused on development of early clinical trials with a translational emphasis. CINJ clinical investigators have an outstanding record of translational clinical trial development, including pharmacokinetic/biomarker studies in several phase I/pilot trials supported by grants from the NCI. This expertise encompasses a wide range of drug targets, including cellular signaling pathways as well as novel immunologic, DNA-, and microtubule- associated targets. From 2004-2006, 42 phase I or pilot trials were active at CINJ, with an average annual accrual of 151 patients to these trials. Scientific themes within these studies included statistically driven dose- and schedule-finding algorithms, as well as validation of target modulation by biochemical studies of cancer tissues. CINJ provides an exceptional and unique resource for early clinical trials of new anti-cancer agents. Expected to reach a population of 9,000,000 by 2008, New Jersey has the highest population density in the United States, with an average of 1,174 people per square mile, which is 13 times the national average.

1U24CA210952-01,U24CA210952,9210297,2016,Integrative miRNA data analysis for clinical cancer genomics,"PROJECT SUMMARY The proposed research has two broad, long-term objectives. First, it seeks to shift medical practice toward more personalized treatments, by applying innovative methods to analyze and integrate DNA, RNA and protein data generated by a large network of GDAN researchers in a miRNA-centric framework. Analyses will identify cancer subtypes, and individual patients within a subtype, in which alterations in the expression of certain miRNAs influence cancer pathogenesis and drug response. Second, the proposed research seeks to shift cancer genomics research by allowing a diverse group of cancer researchers to flexibly access and use the project’s cancer genomics data, and microRNA-centric results and methods, through a cloud computing framework. The proposed research has three specific aims: 1) Build a computational pipeline for processing and analysis of miRNA data, 2) Elucidate the regulation of and by miRNAs through integrative analysis, and 3) Delineate the role of miRNAs in cancer progression and treatment using predictive modeling. Research design and methods: 1) Processing and analysis of miRNA data. We will process total RNA sequence data to identify expressed miRNAs, and extend the current processing pipeline to identify potentially functional miRNA sequence variants. We will apply our miRNA-centric analyses developed for The Cancer Genome Atlas project to identify: subtypes within a cancer, miRNAs that are associated with survival, miRNA targeting effects on gene and protein expression, and cis-effects of copy number and DNA methylation on miRNA abundances. 2) Regulation of and by miRNAs. Collaborating within the research network, we will extend our analysis methods to take into account additional datatypes and functional contexts that influence how miRNAs are regulated, and how they regulate genes and their products. 3) Predictive modeling. As the research network will have detailed clinical data and multiplatform genomic data, we will apply machine learning algorithms in a novel context to key sets of genes, proteins and miRNAs that predict clinical outcomes like survival and drug response. 4) Cloud computing.

First, it seeks to shift medical practice toward more personalized treatments, by applying innovative methods to analyze and integrate DNA, RNA and protein data generated by a large network of GDAN researchers in a miRNA-centric framework. Analyses will identify cancer subtypes, and individual patients within a subtype, in which alterations in the expression of certain miRNAs influence cancer pathogenesis and drug response. Second, the proposed research seeks to shift cancer genomics research by allowing a diverse group of cancer researchers to flexibly access and use the project’s cancer genomics data, and microRNA-centric results and methods, through a cloud computing framework. The proposed research has three specific aims: 1) Build a computational pipeline for processing and analysis of miRNA data, 2) Elucidate the regulation of and by miRNAs through integrative analysis, and 3) Delineate the role of miRNAs in cancer progression and treatment using predictive modeling. Research design and methods: 1) Processing and analysis of miRNA data. We will process total RNA sequence data to identify expressed miRNAs, and extend the current processing pipeline to identify potentially functional miRNA sequence variants. We will apply our miRNA-centric analyses developed for The Cancer Genome Atlas project to identify: subtypes within a cancer, miRNAs that are associated with survival, miRNA targeting effects on gene and protein expression, and cis-effects of copy number and DNA methylation on miRNA abundances. 2) Regulation of and by miRNAs. Collaborating within the research network, we will extend our analysis methods to take into account additional datatypes and functional contexts that influence how miRNAs are regulated, and how they regulate genes and their products. 3) Predictive modeling. As the research network will have detailed clinical data and multiplatform genomic data, we will apply machine learning algorithms in a novel context to key sets of genes, proteins and miRNAs that predict clinical outcomes like survival and drug response. 4) Cloud computing.

1U01CA244291-01,U01CA244291,9868844,2019,Optimizing myeloma-specific immunity after autologous stem cell transplantation,"Abstract Multiple myeloma is the second most common hematological malignancy and despite improved patient outcomes in the era of novel agents, it remains largely incurable. Clinical studies show that autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) remains an efficacious consolidation treatment for eligible patients and a subset of transplant recipients achieve long-term control of disease. Currently, the prolongation of plateau-phase induced by ASCT is attributed to the use of myeloablative chemotherapy and cytoreduction. However, ASCT generates inflammation and profound lymphodepletion, whilst disrupting the marrow microenvironment, all of which has the potential to induce anti-myeloma immunity. We have recently utilized novel preclinical models to provide definitive evidence that ASCT invokes myeloma-specific T cell immunity and the re-establishment of a state of immune equilibrium. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that disease progression after ASCT in these systems is a result of CD8 T cell exhaustion that is dependent on the accumulation of myeloid suppressive populations and the expression of multiple checkpoint molecules by CD8 T cells. These inhibitory pathways are highly amenable to immunotherapeutic approaches after ASCT that invoke long term survival. This proposal will utilize sophisticated protein and transcriptional based approaches to examine the relationship of T cell function in the peri-transplant period to subsequent survival and disease control in well-annotated clinical cohorts.

1U01DE028233-01,U01DE028233,9625949,2018,Targeting the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment to enhance efficacy of radiotherapy and immuno-radiotherapy for oral cancer,"PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT: Radiation therapy (RT) is a mainstay of cancer treatment. However many tumors are resistant to RT, making it possible for microscopic tumor cells to remain or travel to other parts of the body and cause cancer recurrence at a later date. Immunotherapies can train the patient’s immune system to seek out and identify hidden tumor cells. The combination of RT with immunotherapy is a very exciting approach, but RT can have both immune- stimulating and immune suppressive effects, and further study is needed to understand how best to combine RT with immunotherapy. Many scientists now believe that understanding the tumor microenvironment – the types of cells which make up a tumor, and their interactions – is required to maximize the immune-stimulating effects of RT. We have discovered a strategy to alter the balance of cells in the tumor microenvironment of oral cancer and other solid tumor types, by simultaneously targeting immunosuppressive myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and regulatory T cells (Treg), so that immune-stimulating effects of RT predominate. Studies in mouse tumors show that this strategy is particularly effective when combined with an immunotherapy approach called “checkpoint inhibition” that targets molecules that limit effectiveness of anti- tumor T cells. This leads to our scientific hypothesis that tumor-infiltrating MDSC and Treg render the tumor microenvironment resistant to immune activation by RT and/or checkpoint inhibition, and limit the induction of tumor-specific CD8+ T cells and other immune effector immune cells. The goals of this proposal are to 1) determine whether modulating the tumor immune microenvironment enhances responsiveness of oral cancer to RT and/or checkpoint inhibition, leading to long-lasting and powerful anti-tumor effects; 2) determine the immunological mechanisms which make these combination therapies effective; and 3) develop a novel drug formulation which will make this approach more effective and suitable for testing in clinical trials. We will accomplish these goals by carrying out the following specific aims: In Aim 1 we will functionally dissect the immune mechanisms by which MDSC contribute to radioresistance in mouse oral cancer models. In Aim 2 we will assess the ability of dual targeting of MDSC and Treg to sensitize oral cancer to treatment with RT + anti-PD-1 and induce durable protective memory responses. In Aim 3 we will develop a novel drug delivery system that can enhance delivery of inhibitors of MDSC function directly to the tumor and tumor-infiltrating MDSC.",Acute;Adoptive Transfer;Adverse effects;Antitumor Response;Automobile Driving;Binding;Body part;CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes;CD8B1 gene;Cancer Etiology;Cancer Model;Cell physiology;Cells;Chronic;Clinical;Clinical Research;Clinical Trials;Clinical effectiveness;Combined Modality Therapy;Cyclophosphamide;Cytotoxic T-Lymphocytes;Data;Deglutition;Dose;Drug Delivery Systems;Drug Formulations;Effectiveness;Effector Cell;Equilibrium;Goals;Head and Neck Cancer;Human Papillomavirus;Immune;Immune checkpoint inhibitor;Immune response;Immune system;Immunologics;Immunosuppression;Immunosuppressive Agents;Immunotherapeutic agent;Immunotherapy;Impairment;Integrin alpha4beta1;Ligands;Mediating;Memory;Microscopic;Modeling;Mucositis;Mus;Myeloid Cells;Myeloid-derived suppressor cells;NOS2A gene;Nitric Oxide Synthetase Inhibitor;Oral Characters;Oral cavity;Oropharyngeal;PDCD1LG1 gene;Patient Education;Pharyngeal structure;Postoperative Period;Radiation;Radiation therapy;Radiation-Sensitizing Agents;Radioimmunotherapy;Radioresistance;Refractory;Regulatory T-Lymphocyte;Resistance;Role;SLEB2 gene;Scientist;Solid Neoplasm;Speech;System;T memory cell;T-Lymphocyte;Testing;Travel;Treatment Efficacy;Tumor Immunity;anti-PD1 therapy;anti-tumor immune response;antitumor effect;barrier to care;cancer recurrence;cancer therapy;cell type;checkpoint inhibition;chemoradiation;chemotherapy;design;efficacy testing;immune activation;immune checkpoint blockade;immune resistance;immunomodulatory drugs;immunoregulation;inhibitor/antagonist;malignant mouth neoplasm;malignant oropharynx neoplasm;mouse model;mouth squamous cell carcinoma;nanoparticle;nanoparticle delivery;neoplastic cell;novel;novel strategies;novel therapeutics;pre-clinical;radiation effect;radiation response;radioresistant;radiosensitizing;resistance gene;response;saliva secretion;small molecule;small molecule inhibitor;therapy resistant;tumor;tumor growth;tumor microenvironment;uptake,Ananth V Annapragada; Andrew Sikora,Jason Wan,804594,536395,2018-09-18T12:09:00Z,2018-09-19T12:09:00Z,2023-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-17-045,nofo_RFA-CA-17-045,baylor college of medicine,HOUSTON,TX,UNITED STATES,iotn,org_name,False

5U01DE028233-06,U01DE028233,10456621,2022,Targeting the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment to enhance efficacy of radiotherapy and immuno-radiotherapy for oral cancer,"PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT: Radiation therapy (RT) is a mainstay of cancer treatment. However many tumors are resistant to RT, making it possible for microscopic tumor cells to remain or travel to other parts of the body and cause cancer recurrence at a later date. Immunotherapies can train the patient’s immune system to seek out and identify hidden tumor cells. The combination of RT with immunotherapy is a very exciting approach, but RT can have both immune- stimulating and immune suppressive effects, and further study is needed to understand how best to combine RT with immunotherapy. Many scientists now believe that understanding the tumor microenvironment – the types of cells which make up a tumor, and their interactions – is required to maximize the immune-stimulating effects of RT. We have discovered a strategy to alter the balance of cells in the tumor microenvironment of oral cancer and other solid tumor types, by simultaneously targeting immunosuppressive myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and regulatory T cells (Treg), so that immune-stimulating effects of RT predominate. Studies in mouse tumors show that this strategy is particularly effective when combined with an immunotherapy approach called “checkpoint inhibition” that targets molecules that limit effectiveness of anti- tumor T cells. This leads to our scientific hypothesis that tumor-infiltrating MDSC and Treg render the tumor microenvironment resistant to immune activation by RT and/or checkpoint inhibition, and limit the induction of tumor-specific CD8+ T cells and other immune effector immune cells. The goals of this proposal are to 1) determine whether modulating the tumor immune microenvironment enhances responsiveness of oral cancer to RT and/or checkpoint inhibition, leading to long-lasting and powerful anti-tumor effects; 2) determine the immunological mechanisms which make these combination therapies effective; and 3) develop a novel drug formulation which will make this approach more effective and suitable for testing in clinical trials. We will accomplish these goals by carrying out the following specific aims: In Aim 1 we will functionally dissect the immune mechanisms by which MDSC contribute to radioresistance in mouse oral cancer models. In Aim 2 we will assess the ability of dual targeting of MDSC and Treg to sensitize oral cancer to treatment with RT + anti-PD-1 and induce durable protective memory responses.

6U01CA244291-02,U01CA244291,10603047,2019,Optimizing myeloma-specific immunity after autologous stem cell transplantation,"Abstract Multiple myeloma is the second most common hematological malignancy and despite improved patient outcomes in the era of novel agents, it remains largely incurable. Clinical studies show that autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) remains an efficacious consolidation treatment for eligible patients and a subset of transplant recipients achieve long-term control of disease. Currently, the prolongation of plateau-phase induced by ASCT is attributed to the use of myeloablative chemotherapy and cytoreduction. However, ASCT generates inflammation and profound lymphodepletion, whilst disrupting the marrow microenvironment, all of which has the potential to induce anti-myeloma immunity. We have recently utilized novel preclinical models to provide definitive evidence that ASCT invokes myeloma-specific T cell immunity and the re-establishment of a state of immune equilibrium. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that disease progression after ASCT in these systems is a result of CD8 T cell exhaustion that is dependent on the accumulation of myeloid suppressive populations and the expression of multiple checkpoint molecules by CD8 T cells. These inhibitory pathways are highly amenable to immunotherapeutic approaches after ASCT that invoke long term survival. This proposal will utilize sophisticated protein and transcriptional based approaches to examine the relationship of T cell function in the peri-transplant period to subsequent survival and disease control in well-annotated clinical cohorts. A major focus will be the optimization of innovative immunotherapy approaches after ASCT in preclinical systems for clinical translation.",,Geoffrey Roger Hill,Min-Kyung H Song,2208097,2208097,2022-06-07T12:06:00Z,2019-09-25T12:09:00Z,2024-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-19-015,nofo_RFA-CA-19-015,fred hutchinson cancer center,Seattle,WA,UNITED STATES,iotn,org_name,False
1R21CA231904-01,R21CA231904,9604117,2018,An Ontology-driven Faceted Query Engine for the Kentucky Cancer Registry,"ABSTRACT A key barrier in cancer research is the traditional data access workflow that requires a hypothesis prior to accessing patient data, rather than a workflow that begins with data exploration while protecting privacy. Existing query engines allow researchers to explore clinical data, build queries, and execute queries without the need for the user to understand how the data is stored. However, the interfaces of such query engines have not achieved usability approaching the levels of those for consumer websites due in critical part to the lack of faceted capabilities. Faceted systems for querying clinical data is currently unavailable due to the complexity of data and the mismatch between the ontologies used for organizing and annotating clinical data (such as NCI Thesaurus), and the desired facet structures and properties. We propose to overcome these challenges by developing OncoSphere, a query engine using the NCI Thesaurus as a nested facet system (NFS) to provide web-based exploration of the Kentucky Cancer Registry data using 3 Specific Aims. In Aim 1 we will develop an approach to transform and implement NCI Thesaurus into an NFS to enable OncoSphere’s interface features. In Aim 2 we will develop methods to perform quality auditing on the hierarchical structure of the NCI Thesaurus to enhance its quality in supporting faceted query for OncoSphere. In Aim 3 we will perform evaluation on OncoSphere’s query expressiveness, query performance and conduct preliminary usability assessment. OncoSphere will break new ground in web-based tools and capitalize on available data resources to accelerate cancer research. We expect OncoSphere and its future versions to become an invaluable resource for the cancer research community. The long-term goal of this study is to create data exploration systems for NCI’s Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program and other related cancer data resources through data science innovations to transform user experience with a new generation of data interaction modalities.",Address;Adopted;Area;Biomedical Research;Characteristics;Clinical Data;Clinical Research;Clinical Trials;Communities;Computer software;Data;Data Science;Databases;Detection;Development;Ensure;Evaluation;Future;Generations;Goals;Kentucky;Knowledge;Lead;Malignant Neoplasms;Metadata;Methods;Modality;NCI Thesaurus;Online Systems;Ontology;Patients;Performance;Privacy;Property;Research Personnel;Resources;Role;SEER Program;Site;Software Tools;Structure;System;Terminology;Time;Translations;Trees;Work;anticancer research;data access;data integration;data management;data registry;data resource;design;experience;human data;improved;innovation;insight;lexical;neoplasm registry;neoplasm resource;novel;query optimization;sound;success;tool;usability;web app;web site;web-based tool,Licong Cui; Guo-Qiang Zhang,Donna Rivera,187621,187621,2018-06-06T12:06:00Z,2018-06-06T12:06:00Z,2019-02-03T12:02:00Z,PAR-15-334,nofo_PAR-15-334,university of kentucky,LEXINGTON,KY,UNITED STATES,itcr,org_name,False
1R21CA264383-01,R21CA264383,10305561,2021,Predicting transcriptional signatures and tumor subtypes from circulating tumor DNA,"Project Summary/Abstract Tumor phenotype changes, such as trans-differentiation in lethal prostate cancers and hormone receptor conversions in breast cancer, are increasingly frequent observations as resistance mechanisms to targeted therapies. Therefore, characterizing the transcriptional regulation that drives treatment-induced tumor phenotype changes during therapy in “real-time” has critical implications for studying mechanisms of resistance to therapies and informing clinical treatment decisions. Surveillance of molecular changes in tumors is especially challenging because the location and number of metastatic sites make it intractable to perform repeated biopsies. As a result, it is difficult to characterize tumor evolution and cellular plasticity during therapy, exemplifying a major limitation of current treatment strategies and precision medicine for patients with metastatic cancer. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) released from tumor cells into the blood is a non-invasive “liquid biopsy” solution for addressing challenges in tissue accessibility. Current research and clinical efforts have focused on detecting genomic alterations in ctDNA. However, studying the tumor phenotype from ctDNA remains challenging and is still a nascent area of research. The objective of this proposal is to develop an innovative computational method to profile and integrate genomic alterations, chromatin accessibility, and transcriptional regulation directly from standard ctDNA sequencing data. Recent advances and our preliminary studies now demonstrate the intriguing possibility to profile these “multi- omic” patterns solely from computational analysis of standard ctDNA whole genome sequencing data. However, there is still a lack of tools to predict transcriptional profiles from ctDNA. In Aim 1, we will develop a generalized framework to predict transcriptional regulation from ctDNA. We will optimize ctDNA data normalization and develop an unsupervised probabilistic generative model for predicting chromatin accessibility and transcriptional regulation in ctDNA. To evaluate the method, we will perform benchmarking using plasma ctDNA from patient- derived xenograft models. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that the multi-omic signatures profiled from ctDNA will provide a non-invasive approach to classify tumor subtypes and to survey molecular phenotype changes during therapy. We will develop classifiers for predicting tumor subtypes and phenotype changes in adult and pediatric cancers. To test the utility for characterizing multi-omic signature and predicting treatment-induced phenotype changes, we will analyze serial ctDNA samples from patients receiving targeted therapies. The method will be implemented as an open-source R package, and a workflow that can be deployed on local and cloud environments, facilitating its adoption in the cancer research community.

Genomics holds promise for improving classification and prognostication of malignancies, yet oncology practice continues to rely heavily on immunohistochemistry (IHC) as a fundamental tool due to its practicality and ability to provide protein-level and subcellular localization information. The goal of this proposal is to create an open-source software resource for the quantitative analysis of IHC stained tissues and effective integration of IHC, genomic, and clinical features for cancer classification and prognostication. This proposal builds on our collective experience in computer-assisted analysis of microscopic images (including IHC images), development of machine-learning methods to address the challenges of classification and prognostication with heterogeneous and high-dimensional data, and leadership in collection and large-scale analysis of cancer outcomes involving collaboration with multiple medical centers. This effort for the first time will create tools to integrate quantitative IHC imaging, clinical, and genomic information that will in turn enable the research community to explore strategies for the classification of malignancies and prediction of outcomes. The proposed tools will be developed and extensively validated in close collaboration with clinical, genomic, and digital pathology data from the NCI-supported Lymphoma Epidemiology of Outcomes (LEO) cohort study. The software tools produced by this proposal will enable the characterization of subcellular protein expression in cell nuclei, membranes and cytoplasmic compartments. Spatial features of protein expression heterogeneity, along with patient-level summaries of protein expression will be used to develop machine-learning classifiers for cancer subtypes, using diffuse large b-cell lymphomas as a driving application. Technology for automatic tuning of machine learning algorithms will enable a broad class of clinically and biologically motivated users to utilize these tools in their investigations. We will also provide an interactive dashboard that enables users to integrate genomic and IHC-based features to explore prognostic models of patient survival.

We will leverage and extend an existing training platform and content we have developed. We will improve cancer informatics literacy and the usability of existing ITCR tools, support future ITCR tool developers, and teach informatics to a broad cross-section of interested parties. Our success will both deepen expertise within the field and broaden the exposure of ITCR tools within currently-unengaged research communities. Specifically, we will: (1) develop and release a software platform for rapidly prototyping, validating, and sharing modular training materials that can be delivered in a range of formats from massive online open courses, to in-person short courses, to in depth semester long courses, (2) develop informatics courses teaching not only specific use of ITCR tools to solve concrete scientific challenges but also broadly the concepts of informatics to a broad community ranging from citizen scientists to NCI funded PIs, (3) develop courses for ITCR tool developers around usability, documentation, support and marketing to improve the impact of these tools in the field, and (4) deliver in person and ""train the trainer"" courses that will scale the impact of our educational program both within NIH funded cancer centers and into currently underserved researchers at community colleges, minority serving institutions, historically black colleges and universities, and engaged citizens outside of academia. All software, content, and data developed by our program will be open source and made accessible to the broadest possible audience by leveraging our existing expertise in online and scalable in-person education, along with our relationships to MOOC providers, informatics platforms, and developers.

It is widely used by the cancer genomics research community for statistical analysis and visualization. This software ecosystem is supported by core data classes and methods, reused by both users and developers, that provide convenient representations and efficient operations for many kinds of high-throughput molecular data. Falling sequencing costs and single-cell assays enable increasingly resolved study of the molecular biology of cancer, through combined assaying of DNA sequence, epigenetics, gene expression, protein, and other aspects, even at the single-cell level, for a single specimen. These developments present new challenges in complexity, size, and interpretability of the data. The overarching goal of this project is to create and adapt core Bioconductor software infrastructure to meet these challenges, through the following aims. First, we develop infrastructure for the analysis of single-cell multi-omic experiments. Second, we implement FAIR principles for improved somatic variant prioritization, by defining performant data architecture that harmonizes and integrates the large amount of experimental and annotation data available through Bioconductor. Users of our system will be able to create provenance-rich interoperable reports on structural and functional contexts of somatic variants for use in prioritization. Third, we develop scalable infrastructure for the curation, distribution, maintenance, discoverability, and usability of cancer data resources within and externally to Bioconductor.

The goal of this proposal is to create an open-source software resource for the quantitative analysis of IHC stained tissues and effective integration of IHC, genomic, and clinical features for cancer classification and prognostication. This proposal builds on our collective experience in computer-assisted analysis of microscopic images (including IHC images), development of machine-learning methods to address the challenges of classification and prognostication with heterogeneous and high-dimensional data, and leadership in collection and large-scale analysis of cancer outcomes involving collaboration with multiple medical centers. This effort for the first time will create tools to integrate quantitative IHC imaging, clinical, and genomic information that will in turn enable the research community to explore strategies for the classification of malignancies and prediction of outcomes. The proposed tools will be developed and extensively validated in close collaboration with clinical, genomic, and digital pathology data from the NCI-supported Lymphoma Epidemiology of Outcomes (LEO) cohort study. The software tools produced by this proposal will enable the characterization of subcellular protein expression in cell nuclei, membranes and cytoplasmic compartments. Spatial features of protein expression heterogeneity, along with patient-level summaries of protein expression will be used to develop machine-learning classifiers for cancer subtypes, using diffuse large b-cell lymphomas as a driving application. Technology for automatic tuning of machine learning algorithms will enable a broad class of clinically and biologically motivated users to utilize these tools in their investigations. We will also provide an interactive dashboard that enables users to integrate genomic and IHC-based features to explore prognostic models of patient survival. These tools will be released and documented under an open-source model, integrated with HistomicsTK (https://histomicstk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), and available to the broader cancer research community.",Academic Medical Centers;Address;Adopted;Algorithmic Analysis;Algorithms;Automobile Driving;Behavior;Biological;Cancer Patient;Cancer Prognosis;Cell Nucleus;Classification;Clinic;Clinical;Clinical Trials;Cohort Studies;Collaborations;Collection;Color;Communities;Computer Assisted;Computer software;Data;Data Set;Decision Trees;Development;Diagnosis;Disease;ERBB2 gene;Enrollment;Epidemiology;Flowers;Genetic Markers;Genomics;Goals;Heterogeneity;Histology;Image;Image Analysis;Immunohistochemistry;Institution;Investigation;Leadership;Letters;Lymphoma;Machine Learning;Malignant Neoplasms;Manuals;Measurement;Medical center;Membrane;Methods;Modeling;Newly Diagnosed;Non-Hodgkin&apos;s Lymphoma;Oncology;Outcome;Pathologic;Pathologist;Patient-Focused Outcomes;Patients;Precision therapeutics;Prediction of Response to Therapy;Process;Proteins;Quality of life;Reproducibility;Research;Research Personnel;Resources;Science;Site;Software Tools;Stains;Standardization;Stratification;Technology;Testing;Time;Tissue Model;Tissue Stains;Tissues;Variant;Work;anticancer research;base;biomarker-driven;cancer classification;cancer diagnosis;cancer subtypes;cancer survival;clinical practice;clinical research site;cohort;dashboard;data management;design;digital;digital pathology;experience;follow-up;genomic biomarker;genomic data;health management;improved;informatics tool;interactive tool;large cell Diffuse non-Hodgkin&apos;s lymphoma;learning algorithm;learning classifier;machine learning algorithm;machine learning method;malignant breast neoplasm;microscopic imaging;multidimensional data;neoplasm resource;non-Hodgkin&apos;s lymphoma patients;open source;open source tool;operation;outcome prediction;pathology imaging;patient subsets;population health;predict clinical outcome;predicting response;predictive modeling;prognostic;prognostic model;prognostic value;protein expression;public health relevance;software development;tissue processing;tool;translational scientist;treatment strategy;tumor heterogeneity;whole slide imaging,Lee Cooper; Christopher R Flowers; Metin Nafi Gurcan,Rao L Divi,437968,437968,2021-06-04T12:06:00Z,2018-06-12T12:06:00Z,2023-05-31T12:05:00Z,PAR-15-332,nofo_PAR-15-332,northwestern university at chicago,CHICAGO,IL,UNITED STATES,itcr,org_name,False

6R21CA264383-02,R21CA264383,10601439,2021,Predicting transcriptional signatures and tumor subtypes from circulating tumor DNA,"Project Summary/Abstract Tumor phenotype changes, such as trans-differentiation in lethal prostate cancers and hormone receptor conversions in breast cancer, are increasingly frequent observations as resistance mechanisms to targeted therapies. Therefore, characterizing the transcriptional regulation that drives treatment-induced tumor phenotype changes during therapy in “real-time” has critical implications for studying mechanisms of resistance to therapies and informing clinical treatment decisions. Surveillance of molecular changes in tumors is especially challenging because the location and number of metastatic sites make it intractable to perform repeated biopsies. As a result, it is difficult to characterize tumor evolution and cellular plasticity during therapy, exemplifying a major limitation of current treatment strategies and precision medicine for patients with metastatic cancer. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) released from tumor cells into the blood is a non-invasive “liquid biopsy” solution for addressing challenges in tissue accessibility. Current research and clinical efforts have focused on detecting genomic alterations in ctDNA. However, studying the tumor phenotype from ctDNA remains challenging and is still a nascent area of research. The objective of this proposal is to develop an innovative computational method to profile and integrate genomic alterations, chromatin accessibility, and transcriptional regulation directly from standard ctDNA sequencing data. Recent advances and our preliminary studies now demonstrate the intriguing possibility to profile these “multi- omic” patterns solely from computational analysis of standard ctDNA whole genome sequencing data. However, there is still a lack of tools to predict transcriptional profiles from ctDNA. In Aim 1, we will develop a generalized framework to predict transcriptional regulation from ctDNA. We will optimize ctDNA data normalization and develop an unsupervised probabilistic generative model for predicting chromatin accessibility and transcriptional regulation in ctDNA. To evaluate the method, we will perform benchmarking using plasma ctDNA from patient- derived xenograft models. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that the multi-omic signatures profiled from ctDNA will provide a non-invasive approach to classify tumor subtypes and to survey molecular phenotype changes during therapy. We will develop classifiers for predicting tumor subtypes and phenotype changes in adult and pediatric cancers. To test the utility for characterizing multi-omic signature and predicting treatment-induced phenotype changes, we will analyze serial ctDNA samples from patients receiving targeted therapies. The method will be implemented as an open-source R package, and a workflow that can be deployed on local and cloud environments, facilitating its adoption in the cancer research community. This proposal addresses the urgent unmet clinical need for better analytical approaches to study cancer treatment resistance in “real-time” and to advance cancer precision medicine.",,Gavin Ha,Miguel Ossandon,201895,201895,2022-06-09T12:06:00Z,2021-09-10T12:09:00Z,2023-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-20-007,nofo_RFA-CA-20-007,fred hutchinson cancer center,Seattle,WA,UNITED STATES,itcr,org_name,False
7R21CA231904-02,R21CA231904,9949194,2019,An Ontology-driven Faceted Query Engine for the Kentucky Cancer Registry,"ABSTRACT A key barrier in cancer research is the traditional data access workflow that requires a hypothesis prior to accessing patient data, rather than a workflow that begins with data exploration while protecting privacy. Existing query engines allow researchers to explore clinical data, build queries, and execute queries without the need for the user to understand how the data is stored. However, the interfaces of such query engines have not achieved usability approaching the levels of those for consumer websites due in critical part to the lack of faceted capabilities. Faceted systems for querying clinical data is currently unavailable due to the complexity of data and the mismatch between the ontologies used for organizing and annotating clinical data (such as NCI Thesaurus), and the desired facet structures and properties. We propose to overcome these challenges by developing OncoSphere, a query engine using the NCI Thesaurus as a nested facet system (NFS) to provide web-based exploration of the Kentucky Cancer Registry data using 3 Specific Aims. In Aim 1 we will develop an approach to transform and implement NCI Thesaurus into an NFS to enable OncoSphere’s interface features. In Aim 2 we will develop methods to perform quality auditing on the hierarchical structure of the NCI Thesaurus to enhance its quality in supporting faceted query for OncoSphere. In Aim 3 we will perform evaluation on OncoSphere’s query expressiveness, query performance and conduct preliminary usability assessment. OncoSphere will break new ground in web-based tools and capitalize on available data resources to accelerate cancer research. We expect OncoSphere and its future versions to become an invaluable resource for the cancer research community.

1R01CA204136-01A1,R01CA204136,9239352,2017,Credentialing murine models for glioblastoma preclinical drug development,"ABSTRACT Precision medicine promises to revolutionize oncology by targeting drugs to specific mutations. However, targeted drugs have failed to produce durable clinical responses when used as single agents in glioblastoma (GBM), the most common and deadly primary brain tumor. Genetically engineered mouse (GEM) models are essential for functional validation of such mutations, but technical limitations have prevented their widespread use in preclinical cancer drug development. The Miller Lab has developed non- germline GEM (nGEM) models. The Berens Lab has performed comprehensive genomic and chemovulnerability profiling in a genetically diverse and faithful panel of patient-derived human xenograft (PDX) models. The Johnson Lab has developed a novel chemical proteomics method, multiplex inhibitor beads coupled with mass spectrometry (MIB-MS), to assess the activation state of the cellular kinome en masse and has shown that dynamic kinome reprogramming contributes to targeted drug resistance. In this Multi-PI project, we will combine our expertise to address the following Aims: (1) To credential PDX models against human GBM by kinome proteomics; (2) To develop genetically-matched nGEM models from distinct cells of origin; and (3) To credential PDX and nGEM models by dynamic kinome profiling. We will develop a genetically diverse panel of nGEM models with defined driver mutations and cellular origins that will be useful adjunct to PDX for preclinical drug development.

Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is an effective first line therapy for locally advanced or metastatic disease. Unfortunately, once PCa recurs, the eventual development of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) remains an incurable disease and more effective therapies are needed. Currently, a limited number of cancer cell lines (LnCAP, PC3, DU-145, etc.) are available for research and many genetic mutations present in prostate cancer (e.g., SPOP mutation, FOXA1 mutation, TMPRSS2-ERG fusion, CHD1 loss) are not represented in such cells. New patient-derived cancer models are needed. However, patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models are successful at less than 2-5% efficiency with aggressive, high-grade metastatic tumors and organoid cultures only have an efficiency of 20%. However, our preliminary data demonstrate that conditional reprogramming (CR) has nearly a 100% success rate for establishing long-term cultures from either surgical prostate specimens or CT-guided biopsies. In this application, we propose the following specific aims to validate the potential of CR for translational use in human CRPC. We will first establish CR cultures from biopsies of 30 patients with CRPC and will characterize these culture genetically and phenotypically. Second, we compare the patients' drug response to those of corresponding tumor CR cells and their derivative CR- derived xenografts (CDXs). Lastly, we will use CR cultures in an unbiased high-throughput screen to identify new potential therapies for CRPC in collaboration with Dr. Craig Thomas at National Center for Advanced Translational Sciences (NCATS).

The systematic use of CRISPR/Cas9 and pharmacologic tools in established cancer models is showing great potential to discover new targets. However, existing model development approaches require long periods of culture time during which evolutionary pressures reduce heterogeneity. And, it remains challenging to create long-term models for certain tumor types and genotypes, making it challenging to use perturbational tools to experimentally map dependencies. To address these challenges, our overarching goal is to develop ‘rapid ex vivo tumor biosensors’ whereby we would be able to interrogate cancer dependencies in an immediate short-term ‘culture’ of cancer cells taken from a patient biopsy/surgery/fluid collection as a novel research-grade experimental model of cancer. In doing so, we aim to couple the timing of drug or CRISPR/Cas9 perturbation with the preservation of subcellular heterogeneity. If successful, we hypothesize that this modelling approach will more accurately recapitulate patient tumors and may ultimately serve as a stronger foundation for preclinical therapeutic studies. This work should also substantially expand the fraction of patient samples that can be interrogated. Here, we propose using gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma (GEA) as a test case for this strategy due to our experience as well as the existence of marked intra-tumor heterogeneity. However, once established, this novel modeling platform should enable a wide range of basic and translational questions (both for GEA and other tumors) that require model formats that include heterogeneous cell populations. Our goal will be achieved via two Specific Aims including (1) using patient-derived organoids created on rapid time frames for CRISPR/Cas9 editing to validate emerging GEA dependencies; and (2) developing the ability to directly visualize and perturb single cells from matching patient ascites fluid or disaggregated primary tumors ex vivo using label-free imaging methods.

5R01CA248280-04,R01CA248280,10381660,2023,Rapid ex vivo biosensor cultures to assess dependencies in gastroesophageal cancer,"The ability to predict dependencies given the molecular features of a patient’s tumor is central to cancer precision medicine. The systematic use of CRISPR/Cas9 and pharmacologic tools in established cancer models is showing great potential to discover new targets. However, existing model development approaches require long periods of culture time during which evolutionary pressures reduce heterogeneity. And, it remains challenging to create long-term models for certain tumor types and genotypes, making it challenging to use perturbational tools to experimentally map dependencies. To address these challenges, our overarching goal is to develop ‘rapid ex vivo tumor biosensors’ whereby we would be able to interrogate cancer dependencies in an immediate short-term ‘culture’ of cancer cells taken from a patient biopsy/surgery/fluid collection as a novel research-grade experimental model of cancer. In doing so, we aim to couple the timing of drug or CRISPR/Cas9 perturbation with the preservation of subcellular heterogeneity. If successful, we hypothesize that this modelling approach will more accurately recapitulate patient tumors and may ultimately serve as a stronger foundation for preclinical therapeutic studies. This work should also substantially expand the fraction of patient samples that can be interrogated. Here, we propose using gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma (GEA) as a test case for this strategy due to our experience as well as the existence of marked intra-tumor heterogeneity. However, once established, this novel modeling platform should enable a wide range of basic and translational questions (both for GEA and other tumors) that require model formats that include heterogeneous cell populations. Our goal will be achieved via two Specific Aims including (1) using patient-derived organoids created on rapid time frames for CRISPR/Cas9 editing to validate emerging GEA dependencies; and (2) developing the ability to directly visualize and perturb single cells from matching patient ascites fluid or disaggregated primary tumors ex vivo using label-free imaging methods. We will benchmark these approaches against each other using the same clinically annotated, serially collected patient samples. In following the instructions for this RFP, we focus on technology-development focused goals as opposed to deeper mechanistic studies. We focus on benchmarking predictions and assessing reproducibility, sensitivity and specificity. This work is innovative, in that it brings together expertise at the intersection of functional genomics, advanced computational approaches for image-analysis and GEA genomics. If successful, this effort could have significant impact by establishing a foundation to expand this approach to other disease (tumor and non-cancer) indications.",Address;Ascites;Basic Cancer Research;Benchmarking;Biopsy;Biopsy Specimen;Biosensor;CRISPR/Cas technology;Cancer Model;Cell Line;Cell Survival;Cells;Clinical;Collection;Data;Data Collection;Dependence;Derivation procedure;Development;Disease;Drug Exposure;Esophageal Neoplasms;Experimental Models;Foundations;Future;Genomics;Genotype;Goals;Heterogeneity;Image;Instruction;Label;Liquid substance;Malignant Neoplasms;Maps;Methods;Microscopy;Mission;Modeling;Molecular;Monitor;Morbidity - disease rate;Operative Surgical Procedures;Organoids;Outcome Study;Paracrine Communication;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Physiological;Population;Primary Neoplasm;Public Health;Reagent;Reproducibility;Research;Research Personnel;Research Support;Resolution;Sampling;Sensitivity and Specificity;Stomach Neoplasms;Survival Rate;Testing;Therapeutic;Therapeutic Studies;Time;Tissues;Visualization;Work;cancer cell;cell type;cohort;experience;functional genomics;gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma;gastroesophageal cancer;imaging approach;imaging modality;improved;innovation;light transmission;microscopic imaging;model development;mortality;novel;novel strategies;patient response;pharmacologic;pre-clinical;precision medicine;precision oncology;preservation;pressure;response;single-cell RNA sequencing;success;technology development;timeline;tool;translational cancer research;tumor;tumor heterogeneity,Jesse Samuel Boehm,Joanna M.

7R01CA204136-04,R01CA204136,9986359,2019,Credentialing murine models for glioblastoma preclinical drug development,"ABSTRACT Precision medicine promises to revolutionize oncology by targeting drugs to specific mutations. However, targeted drugs have failed to produce durable clinical responses when used as single agents in glioblastoma (GBM), the most common and deadly primary brain tumor. Genetically engineered mouse (GEM) models are essential for functional validation of such mutations, but technical limitations have prevented their widespread use in preclinical cancer drug development. The Miller Lab has developed non- germline GEM (nGEM) models. The Berens Lab has performed comprehensive genomic and chemovulnerability profiling in a genetically diverse and faithful panel of patient-derived human xenograft (PDX) models. The Johnson Lab has developed a novel chemical proteomics method, multiplex inhibitor beads coupled with mass spectrometry (MIB-MS), to assess the activation state of the cellular kinome en masse and has shown that dynamic kinome reprogramming contributes to targeted drug resistance. In this Multi-PI project, we will combine our expertise to address the following Aims: (1) To credential PDX models against human GBM by kinome proteomics; (2) To develop genetically-matched nGEM models from distinct cells of origin; and (3) To credential PDX and nGEM models by dynamic kinome profiling. We will develop a genetically diverse panel of nGEM models with defined driver mutations and cellular origins that will be useful adjunct to PDX for preclinical drug development. We will then credential both PDX and nGEM models against resected GBM specimens using cross-species genome, transcriptome, and kinome, and drug response profiling. Models will be genomically matched to their human counterparts and used to develop rational combination therapies that combat single agent resistance mechanisms in genomically- defined tumor subtypes. This work will therefore help realize the promise of precision medicine in neuro- oncology.",ATRX gene;Address;Allografting;Antibodies;Antineoplastic Agents;BRAF gene;Behavior;Biological;CDKN2A gene;Cancer Biology;Cell Culture Techniques;Cell physiology;Cells;Chemicals;Clinical;Clinical Trials;Combined Modality Therapy;Coupled;Credentialing;Cultured Cells;Disease;Drug Combinations;Drug Modulation;Drug Screening;Drug Targeting;Drug resistance;ERBB2 gene;Environment;Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor;Fatal Outcome;Genes;Genetic;Genetically Engineered Mouse;Genome;Genomics;Glioblastoma;Goals;Growth;Heterogeneity;Human;Immunoassay;MAP Kinase Gene;Malignant Neoplasms;Malignant neoplasm of brain;Mass Spectrum Analysis;Mediating;Methods;Modeling;Molecular;Monitor;Mus;Mutate;Mutation;NF1 gene;Normal Cell;Operative Surgical Procedures;PIK3CG gene;PTEN gene;Pathogenesis;Pathologic;Pathway interactions;Patients;Penetrance;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacodynamics;Phosphotransferases;Preclinical Drug Development;Primary Brain Neoplasms;Proteomics;Reagent;Recurrence;Research Personnel;Resected;Resistance;Signal Transduction;Specimen;TP53 gene;Techniques;Testing;Transplantation;Tumor Subtype;Validation;Work;Xenograft Model;Xenograft procedure;actionable mutation;astrocyte progenitor;base;bcr-abl Fusion Proteins;brain cell;cell type;clinically relevant;combat;dark matter;disorder subtype;drug development;drug discovery;effective therapy;exome sequencing;feasibility trial;human disease;human model;in vitro Model;in vivo;individualized medicine;inhibitor/antagonist;kinase inhibitor;leukemia;malignant breast neoplasm;melanoma;mouse model;nerve stem cell;neuro-oncology;novel;oligodendrocyte progenitor;oncology;pre-clinical;precision medicine;prevent;prospective;public health relevance;resistance mechanism;response;targeted treatment;three dimensional cell culture;transcriptome;transcriptome sequencing;tumor,Michael E.

In our 15-year Partnership, we have accomplished many goals; for example, NMSU now has a strong cancer research infrastructure and Fred Hutch is increasing its attention to health disparities research. Our overall goals for this U54 cycle are to increase and maintain our excellence in the cancer research portfolio, cancer education, and outreach and dissemination; further, we will expand our efforts to develop leaders in cancer research and cancer health disparities research. Five specific aims will help us achieve our overall goals to: (1) Continue to develop a diverse portfolio of robust cancer research projects that span clinical, basic, and population health sciences; (2) Collaborate with regional community organizations that work with underrepresented populations to reduce cancer health disparities; (3) Maintain, strengthen, and evaluate our effective research education programs for current and future underrepresented scientists; (4) Continue to implement evidence-based relevant cancer-related public health interventions within underrepresented communities; and (5) Expand the scientific collaboration among U54 Partnership members and other faculty within the two institutions. To achieve these aims, we have assembled a broad portfolio of innovative cancer research projects (two full research projects and two pilot research projects) that each address an unmet regional need among underrepresented populations. Recent emphasis on health disparities represents a shift in the focus of our Partnership from basic to public health science research projects. These projects benefit from strong community input. In addition to the four research projects, we propose five cores: Administrative, Planning and Evaluation, Research Education About Cancer and Health (REACH), Outreach and Sustain Competitive Cancer Early Stage Scientists (SuCCESS) Cores that promote the development of cancer research, education, community collaboration, in-reach, and outreach. The Partnership has and will continue to play a unique and critical role in both institutions' efforts to increase recruitment and retention of underrepresented individuals in the biomedical research pipeline.

2U54CA132381-17,U54CA132381,10756831,2023,2/2 Partnership for the Advancement of Cancer Research: NMSU & Fred Hutch,"ABSTRACT The Partnership between New Mexico State University (NMSU), an Institution Serving Underserved Health Disparities Populations and Underrepresented Students (ISUPS), and Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center (Fred Hutch), a Comprehensive Cancer Center, has matured into a strong, mutually beneficial partnership from its start as a U56 (2002-2007) and three cycles as a U54 (2007-2023) Partnership. Over the past twenty years, NMSU has increased its commitment to cancer research, and Fred Hutch has expanded its efforts in cancer prevention, education, and health disparities. The Partnership has expanded and adapted opportunities for research, education, training, and community engagement for historically excluded communities (HECs) in the U.S. Southwest and Pacific Northwest, responding to its mission of improving cancer health equity. Population health sciences and transdisciplinary studies are the focus of joint Research Projects to a greater extent than in previous cycles. Expansion of the research education portfolio parallels an increased breadth of cancer and health disparities Research Projects. Lastly, the Partnership has amplified the voices of the communities it serves through community engaged research practices. The Partnership’s goals for the next U54 cycle are to further increase excellence in cancer research, cancer education, and outreach and dissemination portfolios while working towards accomplishing larger transformational changes within the Partnership. This competing renewal application formulates and implements three Guiding Principles for the Partnership: Restructuring Scientific Environments, Restructuring Scientific Processes, and Restructuring Scientific Engagement. These principles bring new opportunities to strengthen equity, inclusion, and diversity across all activities proposed by this U54 Partnership in support of the following three Specific Aims (1) Continue to develop a diverse portfolio of robust cancer Research Projects that span clinical, basic and population health sciences (2) Implement, evaluate, and improve our research education programs for current and future scientists from historically excluded communities (HECs) (3) Collaborate with community organizations on outreach programs in New Mexico and Washington State that work with underrepresented populations to reduce health disparities. To achieve these aims, the Partnership has assembled innovative cancer Research Projects that address an unmet regional needs and benefit from strong community input. Each Core - Administrative, Planning and Evaluation, Research Education About Cancer and Health (REACH), Outreach and Resource for AcademIc SuccEss (RAISE) - has also proposed activities to implement the Guiding Principles. The Partnership formulated activities that are highly integrated across Research Projects and Cores to provide the necessary resources to participants while advancing progress to meeting the Partnership’s mission.","Address;Adopted;Advanced Malignant Neoplasm;Basic Science;Cancer Center;Cancer Research Project;Cancer health equity;Clinical;Collaborations;Communities;Comprehensive Cancer Center;Dedications;Education;Education and Outreach;Environment;Equity;Evaluation;Exclusion;Faculty;Funding;Future;Goals;Graduate Degree;Health;Health Disparities Research;Health Sciences;Health education;Individual;Institution;Internships;Joints;Knowledge;Laboratories;Malignant Neoplasms;Mentors;Mission;New Mexico;Pacific Northwest;Participant;Population Sciences;Process;Public Health;Publications;Recording of previous events;Reduce health disparities;Research;Research Personnel;Research Project Grants;Research Support;Resource Sharing;Resources;Science;Scientist;Southwestern United States;Students;Time;Training;Underrepresented Populations;Underrepresented Students;Underserved Population;Universities;Voice;Washington;Work;anticancer research;cancer education;cancer health disparity;cancer prevention;career;college;community engaged research;community engagement;community organizations;design;education research;equity, diversity, and inclusion;experience;health disparity;health disparity populations;improved;innovation;meetings;member;outreach;outreach program;population health;programs;recruit;success;undergraduate student;university student",Jaimee Heffner; Merranda Marin; Julian A Simon; Graciela Alexandra Unguez,Laritza Maria Rodriguez,1410939,1410939,2023-09-19T12:09:00Z,2007-09-30T12:09:00Z,2028-08-31T12:08:00Z,PAR-22-249,nofo_PAR-22-249,fred hutchinson cancer center,Seattle,WA,UNITED STATES,pache,org_name,False

Unguez, Mary O'Connell (NMSU) and Julian Simon, Beti Thompson (Fred Hutch) [The content of the Overall Section is identical in the NMSU and Fred Hutch proposals.] PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The U54 Partnership between New Mexico State University (NMSU), an Institution Serving Underserved Health Disparities Populations and Underrepresented Students (ISUPS), and Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (Fred Hutch) a major cancer center, is a mature mutually beneficial partnership; the two institutions worked together on a U56 (2002-2007) and two cycles of a U54 (2007 – 2018). In our 15-year Partnership, we have accomplished many goals; for example, NMSU now has a strong cancer research infrastructure and Fred Hutch is increasing its attention to health disparities research. Our overall goals for this U54 cycle are to increase and maintain our excellence in the cancer research portfolio, cancer education, and outreach and dissemination; further, we will expand our efforts to develop leaders in cancer research and cancer health disparities research. Five specific aims will help us achieve our overall goals to: (1) Continue to develop a diverse portfolio of robust cancer research projects that span clinical, basic, and population health sciences; (2) Collaborate with regional community organizations that work with underrepresented populations to reduce cancer health disparities; (3) Maintain, strengthen, and evaluate our effective research education programs for current and future underrepresented scientists; (4) Continue to implement evidence-based relevant cancer-related public health interventions within underrepresented communities; and (5) Expand the scientific collaboration among U54 Partnership members and other faculty within the two institutions. To achieve these aims, we have assembled a broad portfolio of innovative cancer research projects (two full research projects and two pilot research projects) that each address an unmet regional need among underrepresented populations. Recent emphasis on health disparities represents a shift in the focus of our Partnership from basic to public health science research projects. These projects benefit from strong community input. In addition to the four research projects, we propose five cores: Administrative, Planning and Evaluation, Research Education About Cancer and Health (REACH), Outreach and Sustain Competitive Cancer Early Stage Scientists (SuCCESS) Cores that promote the development of cancer research, education, community collaboration, in-reach, and outreach.

1U01CA224193-01,U01CA224193,9450411,2017,Disrupting the immune and drug-privileged microenvironment in pancreas cancer,"PROJECT SUMMARY Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDA) develop an intense fibroinflammatory infiltrate that helps promote disease progression and therapeutic resistance. Recent progress has identified essential barriers in this complex microenvironment that impede drug delivery and suppress immunity. These processes include the prohibitive interstitial pressures generated by high concentrations of hyaluronan (HA) complexed with water, dense fibrosis associated with fibrillar collagen deposition, and multiple classes of immunosuppressive and pro-tumorigenic cells such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells and macrophages. The team assembled in this project has made many of the seminal discoveries described above. In addition, we have developed several highly novel and powerful experimental platforms to rigorously interrogate the complex mechanisms and interactions among various compartments in the tumor microenvironment that collectively conspire to promote the survival of pancreas cancers and metastases and thwart treatment. Our overarching hypothesis is that significantly improving survival for PDA patients will require targeting not only the tumor epithelial cell, but also the three compartments that support its oncogenesis: hematopoietic, mesenchymal and extracellular matrix. In the following, we propose to investigate the combination of cytotoxic therapy with stromal disruption and myeloid cell modulations to maximize engagement of anti-tumor immunity and treatment efficacy. We will pursue these investigations in four distinct experimental platforms that offer complementary strengths and mitigate limitations: 1) genetically engineered mouse models (GEMM) of autochthonous PDA; 2) syngeneic allografts; 3) patient-derived xenograft (PDX) systems; and 4) patient-derived organoids (PDO).",Allografting;Alpha Cell;Architecture;Autologous;Behavior;Biological Models;Biology;Blood Vessels;Cancer Etiology;Cell Therapy;Cells;Cessation of life;Characteristics;Clinic;Coculture Techniques;Collagen;Complement;Complex;Cytotoxic Chemotherapy;Deposition;Disease;Disease Progression;Drug Delivery Systems;Education;Elements;Epithelial Cells;Evolution;Experimental Models;Extracellular Matrix;Extracellular Matrix Proteins;Fibrillar Collagen;Fibroblasts;Fibrosis;Friends;Functional disorder;Gel;Genetically Engineered Mouse;Glycosaminoglycans;Hematopoietic;Human;Hyaluronan;Immune;Immune response;Immunity;Immunosuppression;Immunosuppressive Agents;Investigation;Liquid substance;Malignant neoplasm of pancreas;Mechanics;Mesenchymal;Minority;Modeling;Mus;Myelogenous;Myeloid Cells;Myofibroblast;Neoplasm Metastasis;Normal tissue morphology;Organ;Organoids;Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma;Pathogenesis;Patients;Perfusion;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phase;Physiologic pulse;Physiology;Population;Process;Proteoglycan;Regimen;Research Personnel;Seminal;Series;Signal Transduction;Suppressor-Effector T-Lymphocytes;Surface;System;T-Lymphocyte;Toxic effect;Treatment Efficacy;Treatment Protocols;Tumor Immunity;Tumorigenicity;Water;Xenograft procedure;cell type;combinatorial;cytotoxic;hypoperfusion;improved;insight;interstitial;macrophage;monocyte;mouse model;next generation;novel;novel therapeutics;pressure;receptor;reconstitution;response;standard of care;therapy resistant;treatment strategy;tumor;tumor growth;tumor microenvironment;tumorigenesis;tumorigenic,Sunil R Hingorani,Jeffrey Hildesheim,1846829,1846829,2017-09-25T12:09:00Z,2017-09-30T12:09:00Z,2020-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-17-015,nofo_RFA-CA-17-015,fred hutchinson cancer research center,SEATTLE,WA,UNITED STATES,pacmen,org_name,False

1UM1CA228823-01,UM1CA228823,9565694,2018,Children's Oncology Group Pediatric Early Phase Clinical Trial Network,"The mission of the Pediatric Early Phase Clinical Trials Network (PEP-CTN) is to identify and develop effective new agents for children and adolescents with cancer, through rational and efficient clinical and laboratory research. PEP-CTN clinical trials will incorporate correlative genomics, biology, pharmacology, and imaging studies to further the understanding of the disposition and action of new agents introduced into the treatment of children with cancer. Annually, the PEP-CTN will enroll approximately 120 children and adolescents with cancer onto clinical trials of novel anticancer agents at the 21 core premier pediatric oncology sites throughout the country. The network institutions are selected through a peer review process, and serve as a national and international model for new agent development in pediatric oncology.

A panel of well characterized osteosarcoma patient derived xenografts with genetic changes recapitulating the disease, have been tested by our laboratory as part of the Pediatric Preclinical Testing Program. These efforts thus far have been highly successful in identifying several drugs which are currently being or about to be tested in osteosarcoma clinical trials conducted by the Children's Oncology Group - specifically eribulin and glembatumumab vedotin. Numerous additional osteosarcoma patient derived xenograft models have been developed potentially permitting expansion of the panel of tumors assessed. In this proposal exploration of using a more efficient approach to screen for drug activity in the established models may permit utilization of a broader panel of osteosarcoma patient derived xenografts. In this proposal eltrombopag will be explored for activity in the treatment of osteosarcoma based on promising in vitro data. Building on prior findings, eribulin will be tested for additive activiy with agents routinely used in the treatment of osteosarcoma including cisplatin, cyclophosphamide and etoposide. Finally, a novel ALK inhibitor that also has IGF-1R inhibitory activity, certinib, will be tested as a single agent and in combination with rapamycin for activityin the osteosarcoma patient derived xenografts.

1U01CA199288-01,U01CA199288,8968148,2015,In Vivo Drug Testing of Pediatric CNS Tumors Using Patient Derived Orthotopic Xenograft Models,"﻿ DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is prepared in response to the funding opportunity: Pediatric Preclinical Testing Consortium Research Programs (U01), RFA-CA-14-018. Specifically, we propose for Type B: Research Program for tumors of central nervous system (CNS) in vivo testing. Brain tumors are the leading cause of cancer-related death in children. One of the challenges in clinical drug development is how to effectively prioritize drug candidates to ensure clinical success in cancer patients. As pediatric drug candidates are much more numerous than the small number of patients, it is essential to perform comprehensive pre-clinical testing to identify the investigational agents that are most likely to be effective in the clinic. However, such effort has been blocked for many years due to the lack of clinically relevant and molecularly accurate model systems. Fortunately, we have established a large panel (>70) of patient derived orthotopic xenograft (PDOX) models of pediatric brain tumors through direct injection of patient tumor specimens into the brains of SCID mice. These PDOX models are shown to have replicated the histopathological features, invasive phenotypes and major genetic abnormalities (gene expression, DNA copy number and gene mutations) of the original primary tumors even during serial sub-transplantations in vivo in mouse brains. The xenograft tumor cells can also be cryopreserved for sustained and on-demand supply of tumorigenic PDOX cells. This capacity combined with our optimized surgical procedure, with which we can implant up to 260 mice per day, makes it possible for us to test multiple (e.g., 6-10) drugs per year for every tumor type. Our objective is therefore to make use of this unique panel of PDOX models to examine therapeutic efficacy of new agents and to analyze mechanisms of action and therapy resistance in high grade glioma, medulloblastoma and ependymoma. Our hypothesis is that these patient-specific PDOX tumors will respond to anti-cancer therapies similarly to the corresponding human primary tumors, and the effective agents identified through this system would have better chances of clinical success. To test this hypothesis, we will perform a series of in vitro and in vivo assays to achieve the following aims: 1) to identify genetically accurate candidate PDOX models that bear the therapeutic target(s) of new investigational drugs through data mining of our mouse model molecular characterization databases; 2) to select the most responsive models through functional in vitro screening to determine time- and dose- responses; 3) to demonstrate therapeutic efficacy of new investigational drugs in multiple target-bearing PDOX models; and 4) to perform detailed analysis of cellular and molecular mechanisms of cell killing as well as the causes of therapy resistance both in vitro and in vivo. Our novel panel of PDOX mouse models represents a broad spectrum of genetic abnormalities of pediatric CNS tumors. All the assays are well established and routinely performed in our laboratory; we are uniquely positioned to accomplish the proposed drug studies in vivo.

Our lab’s long- term mission is to identify novel molecular targets in osteosarcoma via comprehensive genomic and proteomic profiling of patient-derived cell lines and xenografts as well as human tumors with the ultimate goal of identifying and/or developing and testing therapeutics against these targets. To achieve this goal, we have a) built a robust profiling platform to identify novel targets; b) expanded our repertoire of osteosarcoma patient derived xenograft (PDX) models to reflect disease heterogeneity; and c) conducted high-throughput in vivo testing of 8-10 new agents each year both as part of Pediatric Preclinical Testing Consortium (PPTC) as well as independent of it. All of these efforts form the basis of our current research proposal and place us strongly poised to successfully achieve our goals. Our overall objective is to efficiently evaluate the efficacy of new agents with high potential to have activity in osteosarcoma based on target data from our genomic and proteomic profiling both as single agents and in rational combinations, with the vision of moving effective agents into clinical trials through the Children’s Oncology Group. We have three specific aims- 1) to select and test agents in vivo against surface targets identified by comprehensive proteomic profiling of osteosarcoma xenografts and patient tumors; 2) to select and test agents in vivo against targets identified by comprehensive genomic profiling of osteosarcoma xenografts and patient tumors; and 3) to perform testing of rationally combined agents based on target, toxicity and efficacy data of single agents. Agents from the PPTC pipeline will be selected based on either the proteomic target or genomic alteration being present in at least a subset of available osteosarcoma PDX models. The agent will be tested in selected cohorts of low/ high expressing protein target or present/ absent genomic alteration. In cases with multiple models with target expression, 3-5 mice per model will be used and in cases with few models available, 8-10 mice per model will be used for control and experiment groups with an overall n per arm per experiment of approximately 30 mice. Standard PPTC procedures will be used for tumor implantation and treatment. Tumor dimensions will be measured twice a week and response quantified as per standard PPTC definitions of complete response, maintained complete response, partial response, stable disease and progressive disease. For combination studies, three potential types of combinations will be considered based on efficacy and toxicity data- a) two surface protein targeted agents such as two antibody-drug conjugates; 2) two molecularly targeted agents and 3) a surface protein targeted agent and a molecularly targeted agent.

Our lab’s long- term mission is to identify novel molecular targets in osteosarcoma via comprehensive genomic and proteomic profiling of patient-derived cell lines and xenografts as well as human tumors with the ultimate goal of identifying and/or developing and testing therapeutics against these targets. To achieve this goal, we have a) built a robust profiling platform to identify novel targets; b) expanded our repertoire of osteosarcoma patient derived xenograft (PDX) models to reflect disease heterogeneity; and c) conducted high-throughput in vivo testing of 8-10 new agents each year both as part of Pediatric Preclinical Testing Consortium (PPTC) as well as independent of it. All of these efforts form the basis of our current research proposal and place us strongly poised to successfully achieve our goals. Our overall objective is to efficiently evaluate the efficacy of new agents with high potential to have activity in osteosarcoma based on target data from our genomic and proteomic profiling both as single agents and in rational combinations, with the vision of moving effective agents into clinical trials through the Children’s Oncology Group. We have three specific aims- 1) to select and test agents in vivo against surface targets identified by comprehensive proteomic profiling of osteosarcoma xenografts and patient tumors; 2) to select and test agents in vivo against targets identified by comprehensive genomic profiling of osteosarcoma xenografts and patient tumors; and 3) to perform testing of rationally combined agents based on target, toxicity and efficacy data of single agents. Agents from the PPTC pipeline will be selected based on either the proteomic target or genomic alteration being present in at least a subset of available osteosarcoma PDX models. The agent will be tested in selected cohorts of low/ high expressing protein target or present/ absent genomic alteration. In cases with multiple models with target expression, 3-5 mice per model will be used and in cases with few models available, 8-10 mice per model will be used for control and experiment groups with an overall n per arm per experiment of approximately 30 mice. Standard PPTC procedures will be used for tumor implantation and treatment. Tumor dimensions will be measured twice a week and response quantified as per standard PPTC definitions of complete response, maintained complete response, partial response, stable disease and progressive disease. For combination studies, three potential types of combinations will be considered based on efficacy and toxicity data- a) two surface protein targeted agents such as two antibody-drug conjugates; 2) two molecularly targeted agents and 3) a surface protein targeted agent and a molecularly targeted agent.

Specifically, we propose for Type B: Research Program for tumors of central nervous system (CNS) in vivo testing. Brain tumors are the leading cause of cancer-related death in children. One of the challenges in clinical drug development is how to effectively prioritize drug candidates to ensure clinical success in cancer patients. As pediatric drug candidates are much more numerous than the small number of patients, it is essential to perform comprehensive pre-clinical testing to identify the investigational agents that are most likely to be effective in the clinic. However, such effort has been blocked for many years due to the lack of clinically relevant and molecularly accurate model systems. Fortunately, we have established a large panel (>70) of patient derived orthotopic xenograft (PDOX) models of pediatric brain tumors through direct injection of patient tumor specimens into the brains of SCID mice. These PDOX models are shown to have replicated the histopathological features, invasive phenotypes and major genetic abnormalities (gene expression, DNA copy number and gene mutations) of the original primary tumors even during serial sub-transplantations in vivo in mouse brains. The xenograft tumor cells can also be cryopreserved for sustained and on-demand supply of tumorigenic PDOX cells. This capacity combined with our optimized surgical procedure, with which we can implant up to 260 mice per day, makes it possible for us to test multiple (e.g., 6-10) drugs per year for every tumor type. Our objective is therefore to make use of this unique panel of PDOX models to examine therapeutic efficacy of new agents and to analyze mechanisms of action and therapy resistance in high grade glioma, medulloblastoma and ependymoma. Our hypothesis is that these patient-specific PDOX tumors will respond to anti-cancer therapies similarly to the corresponding human primary tumors, and the effective agents identified through this system would have better chances of clinical success. To test this hypothesis, we will perform a series of in vitro and in vivo assays to achieve the following aims: 1) to identify genetically accurate candidate PDOX models that bear the therapeutic target(s) of new investigational drugs through data mining of our mouse model molecular characterization databases; 2) to select the most responsive models through functional in vitro screening to determine time- and dose- responses; 3) to demonstrate therapeutic efficacy of new investigational drugs in multiple target-bearing PDOX models; and 4) to perform detailed analysis of cellular and molecular mechanisms of cell killing as well as the causes of therapy resistance both in vitro and in vivo. Our novel panel of PDOX mouse models represents a broad spectrum of genetic abnormalities of pediatric CNS tumors.

Specifically, we propose to continue the in vivo testing program for central nervous system (CNS) tumors using our panel of patient derived orthotopic xenograft (PDOX) models. Brain tumor is the leading cause of cancer-related death in children. One of the challenges in clinical drug development is how to effectively prioritize drug candidates to ensure clinical success in cancer patients. However, efforts in identifying new anti-cancer agents for that are most likely to be effective in the clinic have been blocked for many years due to the lack of clinically relevant and molecularly accurate model system. Fortunately, we have established a panel of 150 PDOX models of pediatric brain tumors through direct injection of patient tumor specimens into the brains of SCID mice. These PDOX models are shown to have replicated the histopathology and major genetic abnormalities of the original patient tumors even during serial sub-transplantations in vivo in mouse brains. They not only represent different clinical stage (i.e., at diagnosis, relapse and terminal/autopsy) but also replicate a broad spectrum of the newly identified molecular subtypes of nearly all types of pediatric brain tumors. The xenograft tumor cells can also be cryopreserved for sustained and on-demand supply of tumorigenic PDOX cells. This capacity combined with our optimized surgical procedure, with which we can implant up to 260 mice per day, makes it possible for us to test multiple (e.g., 6-10) drugs per year for every tumor type. Our objective is therefore to make use of this unique panel of PDOX models to examine therapeutic efficacy of new agents and to analyze mechanisms of action and therapy resistance in high grade glioma, medulloblastoma, ependymoma, DIPG and ATRT. Our hypothesis is that these patient-specific PDOX tumors will respond to anti-cancer therapies similarly to the corresponding human primary tumors, and the effective agents identified through this system would have better chances of clinical success. To test this hypothesis, we will perform a series of in vitro and in vivo assays to achieve the following aims: 1) to identify genetically accurate candidate PDOX models that bear the therapeutic target(s) of new investigational drugs through data mining of our mouse model molecular characterization databases; 2) to select the most responsive models through functional in vitro screening to determine time- and dose-responses; 3) to demonstrate therapeutic efficacy of new investigational drugs in multiple target-bearing PDOX models; and 4) to perform detailed analysis of cellular and molecular mechanisms of cell killing as well as the causes of therapy resistance both in vitro and in vivo.

A panel of well characterized osteosarcoma patient derived xenografts with genetic changes recapitulating the disease, have been tested by our laboratory as part of the Pediatric Preclinical Testing Program. These efforts thus far have been highly successful in identifying several drugs which are currently being or about to be tested in osteosarcoma clinical trials conducted by the Children's Oncology Group - specifically eribulin and glembatumumab vedotin. Numerous additional osteosarcoma patient derived xenograft models have been developed potentially permitting expansion of the panel of tumors assessed. In this proposal exploration of using a more efficient approach to screen for drug activity in the established models may permit utilization of a broader panel of osteosarcoma patient derived xenografts. In this proposal eltrombopag will be explored for activity in the treatment of osteosarcoma based on promising in vitro data. Building on prior findings, eribulin will be tested for additive activiy with agents routinely used in the treatment of osteosarcoma including cisplatin, cyclophosphamide and etoposide. Finally, a novel ALK inhibitor that also has IGF-1R inhibitory activity, certinib, will be tested as a single agent and in combination with rapamycin for activityin the osteosarcoma patient derived xenografts.

1U01CA213359-01,U01CA213359,9246182,2017,Preclinical development of a DLL3-targeted theranostic for small cell lung cancer,"PROJECT SUMMARY Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is remarkable for exceptionally high metastatic potential, initial robust response to DNA damaging agents, and near universal development of resistance. This combination of predilection for early metastasis acquired treatment resistance – often times manifested as cross resistance to multiple agents – highlights a critical need for novel systemic therapies operating through a novel mechanism in order to achieve improved patient outcomes. Delta-like ligand 3 (DLL3), has recently been identified as a therapeutic target in SCLC. The highly tumor-selective surface expression of this protein make it an excellent candidate target for an antibody drug conjugate (ADC). Rovalpituzumab tesserine (Rova-T) is one such ADC that is showing encouraging efficacy signals in the clinic. However, despite apparent clinical benefit, this agent has also been associated with some severe adverse events attributable to the presence of the anthracycline PBD warhead. DLL3 targeting approaches are in need of both a real-time, quantitative diagnostic biomarker and a therapeutic approach with reduced toxicity. We propose a theranostic approach comprising on 89Zr immunoPET and a 90Y/177Lu radioimmunotherapeutic. The first Aim improves upon already promising bioconjugation chemistry. We are already able to obtain high-contrast immunoPET images using non-specific amine labeling and site-specific maleimide bioconjugation. We will improve upon this approach by developing more stable thiol-clickable methylsuflone chelators for 89Zr and 90Y/177Lu to minimize kidney dose. The second Aim identifies preclinical dosing parameters and comprehensively optimizes efficacy and toxicity in a traditional cell line xenograft. Our preliminary imaging data is focused on H82, an SCLC cell lined derived from a chemoexperienced patient. This cell line is very resistant to etoposide in vitro and in vivo and will be used to identify a radiotherapy dose that demonstrates efficacy in vivo, while minimizing dose to the kidney. Different dose ranges and schedules will be explored. The final Aim explores radiotherapy in a variety of in vivo contexts including lesion sizes ranging from 0.1 to 10 mm in diameter and representing both chemonaïve and chemoresistant disease. Radioisotopes have different energy deposition depending on the volume of the tumor being targeted. We will evaluate 90Y and 177Lu radioisotopes in different in vivo models of small cell lung cancer for the ability to eradicate lesions of different sizes. A unique resource in the lab is our collection of 10 paired chemonaïve and chemoresistant patient-derived xenograft lines. We will place particular emphasis on establishing efficacy in the context of acquired chemoresistance.

1U01CA235625-01,U01CA235625,9670435,2019,Employing CRISPR inactivation screening and in vivo models towards improving treatments for SCLC,"SUMMARY With a lack of druggable oncogenic mutations in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and no approved targeted therapies, we need to identify new treatment approaches for SCLC. In this proposal, we apply whole genome CRISPR inactivation screens to identify genes that are essential for SCLC broadly, or for key genetically defined subsets. We then determine whether pharmacologic inhibition of identified hits also results in selective killing of SCLC cells. We apply in vivo systems including patient derived xenograft (PDX) and genetically engineered mouse models to test pharmacologic inhibitors of key targets identified in these genetic screens. Aim 1 will focus on a pathway that we already identified using CRISPR inactivation screens to be essential for Rb/p53-mutant SCLC cells. Components of a NEDD8/RBX1 pathway, controlling Cullin activity and protein ubiquitylation, were essential for SCLC cells. Pharmacologic inhibition of NEDD8 activating enzyme (NAE) using MLN4924 in patient derived xenograft (PDX) models confirmed reliance of SCLC cells on this pathway. Excitingly, we identified examples of exceptional responses to MLN4924 in some PDX models. Aim 1: Apply in vivo models to direct NEDD8 inhibition to subsets of SCLC most likely to respond. Here, we explore the potential for inhibiting the NEDD8 pathway in SCLC. We will combine NAE inhibition with cisplatin-etoposide chemotherapy and determine whether durable responses result. Some SCLC PDX models exhibited exquisite sensitivity to NAE inhibition; we will identify underlying mechanisms and genetic features of super-responding PDX models that could be used to help predict exceptional responders. We will determine whether NAE inhibition should be directed to all SCLC patients, or to key subsets, and whether this approach augments response to chemotherapy. MLN4924 is already being tested in clinical trials for other cancer types and this work could rapidly lead to clinical trials in SCLC. Aim 2: Apply CRISPR inactivation screens to identify new therapeutic targets for SCLC. This Aim will extend our CRISPR inactivation screens to include mouse SCLC cell lines with key driver mutations beyond Rb/p53, including Pten, Crebbp and Mycl. Our approach takes advantage of the fact that while human SCLC has an extremely high mutational burden, leading to extensive heterogeneity among SCLC with a given driver mutation, mouse SCLC with defined driver alterations are more homogenous, increasing signal to noise in identifying vulnerabilities. We will identify dependencies in genetically-defined subsets of SCLC and will test inhibitors of identified druggable targets in PDX and GEM models that harbor defined genetic alterations. We leverage available mouse models and derived cell lines, along with a bank of genetically annotated PDX models, studied in vivo and ex vivo, to identify and evaluate completely new ways to target key genetic subsets of SCLC.",Biology;Cancer Model;Cancer Patient;Cancer cell line;Cell Death;Cell Line;Cisplatin;Clinical Trials;Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats;Cullin Proteins;Dependence;Enzyme Inhibition;Enzymes;Epithelium;Essential Genes;Etoposide;Exhibits;Gene Deletion;Genes;Genetic;Genetic Models;Genetic Screening;Genetic Transcription;Genetically Engineered Mouse;Genotype;Goals;Heterogeneity;Human;Lead;Link;Lung;MYCL1 gene;Modeling;Molecular;Mus;Mutate;Mutation;Neuroendocrine Tumors;Noise;Oncogenic;Pathway interactions;Patients;Pharmacology;Proteins;RBX1 gene;Signal Transduction;System;TP53 gene;Testing;Therapeutic;Tumor Cell Line;Tumor Volume;Work;Xenograft Model;Xenograft procedure;actionable mutation;base;cancer cell;cancer type;chemotherapy;drug sensitivity;druggable target;efficacy testing;exceptional responders;gene function;improved;in vivo;in vivo Model;inhibitor/antagonist;knock-down;lung small cell carcinoma;mouse model;mutant;neuroendocrine differentiation;new therapeutic target;novel;novel strategies;novel therapeutics;overexpression;programs;response;screening;small molecule inhibitor;targeted treatment;tumor;whole genome,David Macpherson,Suzanne L Forry,516606,516606,2019-03-06T12:03:00Z,2019-03-08T12:03:00Z,2024-02-29T12:02:00Z,PAR-16-049,nofo_PAR-16-049,fred hutchinson cancer research center,SEATTLE,WA,UNITED STATES,sclc,org_name,False
1U01CA256801-01,U01CA256801,10126626,2021,Optimizing Dual-Targeted and Dual-Armored CAR T Cells for Small Cell Lung Cancer,"ABSTRACT A patient's own T cells can be modified using gene therapy technology to express receptors, termed chimeric antigen receptors or CARs, which allow these immune T cells to recognize proteins on the tumor cell surface, and in turn allow these CAR modified T cells to recognize and kill the patient's own tumor cells. This approach has been successful in some hematological malignancies, however, it has not been successful to date in solid tumors including small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Two mechanisms by which SCLC may evade T cell-mediated killing are loss of expression of antigens, and suppression of T cell function in the tumor microenvironment. In this proposal, we will attempt to overcome these barriers by designing CAR T cells that target two SCLC antigens simultaneously, and that produce multiple factors (“armors”) that enhance T cell activity in solid tumors. We hypothesize that these dual-armored, dual targeted (DADT) CAR T cells will be more effective against SCLC than previous T cell-mediated and immune therapies. We have previously shown that CAR T cells targeted to either the antigen GD3 or to the antigen DLL3, both of which are expressed on the majority of small cell lung cancers, are capable of killing SCLC cells in preclinical systems. Additionally, we have developed multiple armored CAR T cells that secrete factors such as IL-18, or an antibody-derived single-chain variable fragment (scFv) that blocks the immune checkpoint receptor PD-1, or an scFv blocking the phagocytosis-inhibitory signal CD47 on tumor cells. All of these armors enhance CAR T cell activity in our in vivo model systems through different mechanisms. In Aim 1 of this proposal, we will generate CAR T cells targeting DLL3 and GD3 simultaneously, to overcome antigen heterogeneity and antigen loss in tumors as a means of escape from T cell-mediated killing. Simultaneously, in Aim 2, we will test pairs of armors to identify the pair that is the most effective at enhancing the activity of single antigen-targeted CAR T cells against SCLC in vivo in immunocompetent systems. We then analyze the immune cells in the SCLC tumor microenvironment following CAR T cell treatment to assess changes mediated by the armored CAR T cells. Ultimately, in Aim 3, we will combine these approaches to generate CAR T cells that recognize GD3 and DLL3 and produce multiple armors. These DADT CAR T cells for SCLC may be suitable for further preclinical testing in preparation for clinical trials beyond the scope of this proposal, representing a novel therapeutic approach to SCLC. Given our robust track record in CAR T cell clinical translation, we fully anticipate having new CAR T cells suitable for clinical trials at the conclusion of funding. Additionally, these novel CAR T cells may be used as tools to explore the interactions between T cells and the SCLC microenvironment. The analysis of changes in SCLC tumors induced by the armored CAR T cells proposed here may reveal novel aspects of SCLC biology and illuminate mechanisms of immune escape and treatment failure in SCLC.",Acute;Address;Anti-CD47;Antibodies;Antigen Targeting;Antigens;Biological Models;Biology;CD19 gene;CD47 gene;Cancer Biology;Cell Therapy;Cell physiology;Cell surface;Cells;Clinical;Clinical Trials;Data;Development;Disease;Down-Regulation;Eating;Extensive Stage;FDA approved;Failure;Funding;Ganglioside GD3;Generations;Genetic;Genetic Engineering;Goals;Hematologic Neoplasms;Hepatitis delta Antigens;Heterogeneity;Human;Immune;Immune system;Immunocompetent;Immunoglobulin Fragments;Immunotherapy;In Vitro;Interleukin-12;Interleukin-18;Investigational New Drug Application;Ligands;Malignant neoplasm of ovary;Mediating;Methods;Modality;Molecular;Mutation;Patients;Phagocytosis;Phase I Clinical Trials;Pre-Clinical Model;Preclinical Testing;Preparation;Prognosis;Proteins;Refractory;Relapse;Resistance;Signal Transduction;Solid Neoplasm;System;T-Lymphocyte;Technology;Testing;Therapeutic;Treatment Failure;Tumor Antigens;Work;anti-PD-1;anti-tumor immune response;cancer cell;cancer therapy;checkpoint receptors;chimeric antigen receptor;chimeric antigen receptor T cells;clinical translation;clinically relevant;cytokine;design;gene therapy;genetically modified cells;immune checkpoint;improved;in vivo;in vivo Model;lung cancer cell;lung small cell carcinoma;macrophage;molecular targeted therapies;mouse model;neoplastic cell;neuroendocrine cancer;notch protein;novel;novel therapeutic intervention;novel therapeutics;patient derived xenograft model;pre-clinical;programmed cell death protein 1;receptor;response;tool;tumor;tumor microenvironment,Renier Joseph Brentjens,Suzanne L Forry,661095,661095,2021-03-30T12:03:00Z,2021-04-01T12:04:00Z,2021-08-31T12:08:00Z,PAR-19-361,nofo_PAR-19-361,sloan-kettering inst can research,NEW YORK,NY,UNITED STATES,sclc,org_name,False

5U01CA213359-05,U01CA213359,10172863,2021,Clinical development of a DLL3-targeted theranostic for small cell lung cancer,"PROJECT SUMMARY Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is remarkable for exceptionally high metastatic potential, initial robust response to DNA damaging agents, and near universal development of resistance. This combination of predilection for early metastasis acquired treatment resistance – often times manifested as cross resistance to multiple agents – highlights a critical need for novel systemic therapies operating through a novel mechanism in order to achieve improved patient outcomes. Delta-like ligand 3 (DLL3), has recently been identified as a therapeutic target in SCLC. The highly tumor-selective surface expression of this protein make it an excellent candidate target for an antibody drug conjugate (ADC). Rovalpituzumab tesserine (Rova-T) is one such ADC that is showing encouraging efficacy signals in the clinic. However, despite apparent clinical benefit, this agent has also been associated with some severe adverse events attributable to the presence of the anthracycline PBD warhead. DLL3 targeting approaches are in need of both a real-time, quantitative diagnostic biomarker and a therapeutic approach with reduced toxicity. We propose a theranostic approach comprising on 89Zr immunoPET and a 90Y/177Lu radioimmunotherapeutic. The first Aim improves upon already promising bioconjugation chemistry. We are already able to obtain high-contrast immunoPET images using non-specific amine labeling and site-specific maleimide bioconjugation. We will improve upon this approach by developing more stable thiol-clickable methylsuflone chelators for 89Zr and 90Y/177Lu to minimize kidney dose. The second Aim identifies preclinical dosing parameters and comprehensively optimizes efficacy and toxicity in a traditional cell line xenograft. Our preliminary imaging data is focused on H82, an SCLC cell lined derived from a chemoexperienced patient. This cell line is very resistant to etoposide in vitro and in vivo and will be used to identify a radiotherapy dose that demonstrates efficacy in vivo, while minimizing dose to the kidney. Different dose ranges and schedules will be explored. The final Aim explores radiotherapy in a variety of in vivo contexts including lesion sizes ranging from 0.1 to 10 mm in diameter and representing both chemonaïve and chemoresistant disease. Radioisotopes have different energy deposition depending on the volume of the tumor being targeted. We will evaluate 90Y and 177Lu radioisotopes in different in vivo models of small cell lung cancer for the ability to eradicate lesions of different sizes. A unique resource in the lab is our collection of 10 paired chemonaïve and chemoresistant patient-derived xenograft lines.

5U01CA256801-03,U01CA256801,10380107,2023,Optimizing Dual-Targeted and Dual-Armored CAR T Cells for Small Cell LungCancer,"ABSTRACT A patient's own T cells can be modified using gene therapy technology to express receptors, termed chimeric antigen receptors or CARs, which allow these immune T cells to recognize proteins on the tumor cell surface, and in turn allow these CAR modified T cells to recognize and kill the patient's own tumor cells. This approach has been successful in some hematological malignancies, however, it has not been successful to date in solid tumors including small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Two mechanisms by which SCLC may evade T cell-mediated killing are loss of expression of antigens, and suppression of T cell function in the tumor microenvironment. In this proposal, we will attempt to overcome these barriers by designing CAR T cells that target two SCLC antigens simultaneously, and that produce multiple factors (“armors”) that enhance T cell activity in solid tumors. We hypothesize that these dual-armored, dual targeted (DADT) CAR T cells will be more effective against SCLC than previous T cell-mediated and immune therapies. We have previously shown that CAR T cells targeted to either the antigen GD3 or to the antigen DLL3, both of which are expressed on the majority of small cell lung cancers, are capable of killing SCLC cells in preclinical systems. Additionally, we have developed multiple armored CAR T cells that secrete factors such as IL-18, or an antibody-derived single-chain variable fragment (scFv) that blocks the immune checkpoint receptor PD-1, or an scFv blocking the phagocytosis-inhibitory signal CD47 on tumor cells. All of these armors enhance CAR T cell activity in our in vivo model systems through different mechanisms. In Aim 1 of this proposal, we will generate CAR T cells targeting DLL3 and GD3 simultaneously, to overcome antigen heterogeneity and antigen loss in tumors as a means of escape from T cell-mediated killing. Simultaneously, in Aim 2, we will test pairs of armors to identify the pair that is the most effective at enhancing the activity of single antigen-targeted CAR T cells against SCLC in vivo in immunocompetent systems. We then analyze the immune cells in the SCLC tumor microenvironment following CAR T cell treatment to assess changes mediated by the armored CAR T cells. Ultimately, in Aim 3, we will combine these approaches to generate CAR T cells that recognize GD3 and DLL3 and produce multiple armors. These DADT CAR T cells for SCLC may be suitable for further preclinical testing in preparation for clinical trials beyond the scope of this proposal, representing a novel therapeutic approach to SCLC. Given our robust track record in CAR T cell clinical translation, we fully anticipate having new CAR T cells suitable for clinical trials at the conclusion of funding. Additionally, these novel CAR T cells may be used as tools to explore the interactions between T cells and the SCLC microenvironment. The analysis of changes in SCLC tumors induced by the armored CAR T cells proposed here may reveal novel aspects of SCLC biology and illuminate mechanisms of immune escape and treatment failure in SCLC.",Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia;Address;Anti-CD47;Antibodies;Antigen Targeting;Antigens;Biological Models;Biology;CD19 gene;CD47 gene;Cancer Biology;Cell physiology;Cell secretion;Cell surface;Cells;Clinical;Clinical Trials;Data;Development;Disease;Down-Regulation;Eating;Extensive Stage;FDA approved;Failure;Funding;Ganglioside GD3;Generations;Genetic;Genetic Engineering;Goals;Hematologic Neoplasms;Hepatitis delta Antigens;Heterogeneity;Human;IL18 gene;Immune;Immune checkpoint inhibitor;Immune system;Immunocompetent;Immunoglobulin Fragments;Immunotherapy;In Vitro;Interleukin-12;Investigational New Drug Application;Ligands;Lymphoma;Macrophage;Malignant neoplasm of ovary;Mediating;Methods;Modality;Molecular;Mutation;Patients;Persons;Phagocytosis;Phase I Clinical Trials;Pre-Clinical Model;Preclinical Testing;Preparation;Prognosis;Proteins;Refractory;Relapse;Resistance;Signal Transduction;Solid Neoplasm;System;T-Lymphocyte;Technology;Testing;Therapeutic;Treatment Failure;Tumor Antigens;Work;anti-PD-1;anti-tumor immune response;cancer cell;cancer therapy;checkpoint receptors;chimeric antigen receptor;chimeric antigen receptor T cells;clinical translation;clinically relevant;cytokine;design;gene therapy;genetically modified cells;immune checkpoint;improved;in vivo;in vivo Model;lung cancer cell;molecular targeted therapies;mouse model;neoplastic cell;neuroendocrine cancer;notch protein;novel;novel therapeutic intervention;novel therapeutics;patient derived xenograft model;pre-clinical;programmed cell death protein 1;receptor;response;small cell lung carcinoma;tool;tumor;tumor microenvironment,Renier Joseph Brentjens,Suzanne L Forry,630691,630691,2023-05-01T12:05:00Z,2021-04-01T12:04:00Z,2026-03-31T12:03:00Z,PAR-19-361,nofo_PAR-19-361,roswell park cancer institute corp,BUFFALO,NY,UNITED STATES,sclc,org_name,False

The proposal comprises clinical, translational, and basic science investigators with significant NCI support related to the focus of the application. The thematics targeted are a natural extension on the funded research of SPORE investigators and include: novel clinical trials with assessment of surrogate markers of response, the identification of markers of breast cancer risk in pre-neoplastic syndromes, and the discovery of proteins predictive of breast cancer invasiveness and therapeutic response using imaging mass spectrometry. Project 1 will determine the antitumor effect of OSI-774, an inhibitor of the HER (erbB) signaling network in patients with operable breast cancer and identify a molecular profile associated with evidence of response in situ. This will identify a population that can be the target of randomized trials with HER signaling inhibitors. Project 2 will determine if paclitaxel administration to patients with locally advanced breast cancer leads to tumor cell transit into mitosis, loss of proliferation, and apoptosis, and if these events predict for tumor response. Both of these Projects will use imaging mass spectrometry to discover novel protein profiles predictive of drug action in two non-overlapping patient populations. Project 3 will use imaging mass spectrometry in microdissected primary breast cancers to identify proteins that segregate DCIS from invasive cancer and tumor from non-tumor stroma. In a mouse model of breast cancer this Project will spatially profile anticancer drugs with mass spectrometric evidence of drug action on established and novel protein targets. Project 4 will determine if alterations in components of the TGF-beta and EGF receptor pathways are associated with enhanced breast cancer risk in the Nashville Breast Cohort, a large cohort of women with 14 years of follow-up and with available archival material. This Project will also address for the first time in African-Americans in this cohort, whether breast cancer risk is affected by breast hyperplasia. To support these translational projects, we propose six CORES: Administrative and Outreach, Tissue, Proteomics and Emerging Technologies, Antibody Production and Characterization, Biostatistics, and Biomedical Informatics. The proposed Developmental Research (Pilot) and Career Development Programs are tightly integrated with Institutional initiatives and mechanisms that identify local research strengths as well as the best translational researchers.

2P50CA098131-06,P50CA098131,7504833,2008,SPORE in Breast Cancer,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is the first competing renewal application of the Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center (VICC) Breast Cancer SPORE Grant. It is comprised of investigators with expertise in cellular signaling and molecular biology, breast pathology, medical, surgical, and radiation oncology, clinical trial design, epidemiology and population studies, mass spectrometry, imaging, biostatistics, and biomedical informatics. We have made progress in our previous funding cycle, have established productive collaborations with other SPOREs and other national and international groups, and have firmly established a true multidisciplinary program which we believe will be productive in the years to come. In this competing renewal we propose four bi-directional translational projects addressing basic, clinical and population research questions in human breast cancer. Project 1: Resistance to antiestrogen therapy in hormone receptor-positive breast cancer (Carlos L. Arteaga, MD) Project 2: p63/p73 signaling axis as a target for treatment of triple negative breast cancer (Jennifer Pietenpol, PhD) Project 3: Cellular mechanisms of bone quality in metastatic breast cancer (Gregory Mundy, MD) Project 4: Genetic predictors of progression of premalignant breast disease (Jeffrey Smith, MD, PhD and William Dupont, PhD) In our opinion, these projects meet the eligibility criteria set forth in the SPORE guidelines. They span themes involving discovery of mechanisms of antiestrogen resistance, determining pathogenic mechanisms and new therapies for triple negative breast cancer, identifying genetic markers of breast cancer risk in women with preneoplastic mammary lesions, and investigating mechanisms and biomarkers of bone quality in patients with metastatic breast cancer. The SPORE has access to a substantial breast cancer population and an established record of accrual to clinical trials. The leadership of the VICC and VUMC has provided strong Institutional support for the success of the individuals involved in this application. A significant amount of support has been promised by the Institution in the event of successful funding of this application. Meritorious research applications for developmental (pilot) projects will be solicited from throughout the VICC, VUMC, and Meharry Medical College. The SPORE has supported and will continue to identify and support the careers of young investigators starting a career in breast cancer and of more established investigators adding a promising domain in breast cancer research to their programs. To support the research aims in the translational research projects, we propose five shared Core Resources. Each of these cores supports at least 3 projects in this competing renewal application. They are Administration & Outreach, Tissue, Clinical, Biostatistics, and Imaging Cores.",,Carlos L Arteaga,Joyann Courtney,2300000,2300000,2008-09-11T12:09:00Z,2003-08-07T12:08:00Z,2013-05-31T12:05:00Z,PAR-06-505,award_P50CA098131,vanderbilt university,Nashville,TN,UNITED STATES,spore_breast_cancer_vanderbilt,org_name,False

The proposal comprises clinical, translational, and basic science investigators with significant NCI support related to the focus of the application. The thematics targeted are a natural extension on the funded research of SPORE investigators and include: novel clinical trials with assessment of surrogate markers of response, the identification of markers of breast cancer risk in pre-neoplastic syndromes, and the discovery of proteins predictive of breast cancer invasiveness and therapeutic response using imaging mass spectrometry. Project 1 will determine the antitumor effect of OSI-774, an inhibitor of the HER (erbB) signaling network in patients with operable breast cancer and identify a molecular profile associated with evidence of response in situ. This will identify a population that can be the target of randomized trials with HER signaling inhibitors. Project 2 will determine if paclitaxel administration to patients with locally advanced breast cancer leads to tumor cell transit into mitosis, loss of proliferation, and apoptosis, and if these events predict for tumor response. Both of these Projects will use imaging mass spectrometry to discover novel protein profiles predictive of drug action in two non-overlapping patient populations. Project 3 will use imaging mass spectrometry in microdissected primary breast cancers to identify proteins that segregate DCIS from invasive cancer and tumor from non-tumor stroma. In a mouse model of breast cancer this Project will spatially profile anticancer drugs with mass spectrometric evidence of drug action on established and novel protein targets. Project 4 will determine if alterations in components of the TGF-beta and EGF receptor pathways are associated with enhanced breast cancer risk in the Nashville Breast Cohort, a large cohort of women with 14 years of follow-up and with available archival material. This Project will also address for the first time in African-Americans in this cohort, whether breast cancer risk is affected by breast hyperplasia.

The overall goal of the Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center (VICC) SPORE in Breast Cancer is to conduct collaborative, multidisciplinary and mechanism-based translational research that will have the highest possible impact for women and men with or at risk for breast cancer. This project for the Administrative Supplement for NCI Global Oncology Mentored Research will assess response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer in patients undergoing breast cancer treatment in Kijabe, Kenya through a formal mentored research relationship between researchers at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and a faculty member (a medical oncologist/radiation oncologist) at AIC Kijabe Hospital. Dr. Christine Mwakio (medical/radiation oncology) is an early-career low-middle income country researcher (ESLI) who is actively involved in the care of breast cancer patients in Kenya. She proposes a two-part study. First, she will evaluate the clinical response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and the relationship between response to therapy and patient demographics, tumor characteristics, social determinants of health and treatment regimen in patients diagnosed with breast cancer at Kijabe Hospital. Second, she will compare the molecular subtypes of breast cancer with response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, correlating with residual cancer burden score in Kijabe, Kenya. Funds from this subcontract will support the salary of the ESLI, two research assistants, laptops for the research assistants to complete this project, funds to perform immunohistochemistry analysis on both breast biopsy specimens and surgical breast specimens, and use of public transportation for patients in the study to return to Kijabe, Kenya for follow-up.

The proposal comprises clinical, translational, and basic science investigators with significant NCI support related to the focus of the application. The thematics targeted are a natural extension on the funded research of SPORE investigators and include: novel clinical trials with assessment of surrogate markers of response, the identification of markers of breast cancer risk in pre-neoplastic syndromes, and the discovery of proteins predictive of breast cancer invasiveness and therapeutic response using imaging mass spectrometry. Project 1 will determine the antitumor effect of OSI-774, an inhibitor of the HER (erbB) signaling network in patients with operable breast cancer and identify a molecular profile associated with evidence of response in situ. This will identify a population that can be the target of randomized trials with HER signaling inhibitors. Project 2 will determine if paclitaxel administration to patients with locally advanced breast cancer leads to tumor cell transit into mitosis, loss of proliferation, and apoptosis, and if these events predict for tumor response. Both of these Projects will use imaging mass spectrometry to discover novel protein profiles predictive of drug action in two non-overlapping patient populations. Project 3 will use imaging mass spectrometry in microdissected primary breast cancers to identify proteins that segregate DCIS from invasive cancer and tumor from non-tumor stroma. In a mouse model of breast cancer this Project will spatially profile anticancer drugs with mass spectrometric evidence of drug action on established and novel protein targets. Project 4 will determine if alterations in components of the TGF-beta and EGF receptor pathways are associated with enhanced breast cancer risk in the Nashville Breast Cohort, a large cohort of women with 14 years of follow-up and with available archival material. This Project will also address for the first time in African-Americans in this cohort, whether breast cancer risk is affected by breast hyperplasia. To support these translational projects, we propose six CORES: Administrative and Outreach, Tissue, Proteomics and Emerging Technologies, Antibody Production and Characterization, Biostatistics, and Biomedical Informatics. The proposed Developmental Research (Pilot) and Career Development Programs are tightly integrated with Institutional initiatives and mechanisms that identify local research strengths as well as the best translational researchers.

1P50CA228944-01A1,P50CA228944,9701765,2019,Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center Lung SPORE,"Project Summary/Abstract – Overall The Fred Hutch Lung SPORE consists of four innovative projects, three supportive cores, and the required Developmental Research Program and Career Enhancement Program. We have leveraged the strengths of the investigators and our Center to tackle three critical barriers precluding meaningful improvements in lung cancer survival rates: facilitation of pulmonary nodule evaluation for lung cancer early detection and screening, lack of effective therapies for small cell lung cancer (SCLC), and the sub-optimal response rates of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients to novel immune-based therapies. To overcome these barriers, we propose the following four projects: 1) Targeting the Neutrophil Lineage to Enhance Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor Efficacy in NSCLC, 2) Targeting Neoantigens for Lung Cancer Immunotherapy, 3) Identifying Determinants of Sensitivity to LSD1 Inhibition in SCLC, and 4) Risk Stratification for Pulmonary Nodules Detected by CT Imaging Using Plasma and Imaging Biomarkers.

The extensive scientific and clinical resources at the Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center (DF/HCC) will be leveraged – marshaling local expertise in cell and molecular biology, genetics, immunology, biostatistics, chemistry, murine models, and clinical trial development – in order to perform innovative pre-clinical studies, to validate novel drug targets in patient cells, and to design and implement clinical trials that will eventually lead to improved outcomes for patients with myeloid malignancies. Each of the four Projects will promote detailed analysis of a promising new target by a combination of pre-clinical studies to optimize therapeutic development and early-stage clinical trials. Project 1 leverages recent exciting data from the laboratory of Dr. Scott Armstrong regarding the efficacy of targeting the MLL-menin interaction, which is essential for maintaining HOXA expression and maintenance of leukemia stem cells. Project 2 is based on the discovery by the Stegmaier laboratory that many cases of AML are dependent on SYK kinase activation, and that SYK activation causes chemotherapy resistance. Project 3 will examine the pre-clinical and clinical efficacy of a novel SF3B1 inhibitor, using an Sf3b1-mutant model developed by the Ebert laboratory, for the treatment MDS. Project 4 will examine the potential synergy of a highly effective vaccine with a potent immunologic checkpoint inhibitor for the treatment of AML. The Cores have been designed to support all projects in translational research. The laboratory and clinical research components of each project will interface with Core 1 for statistical guidance in both experimental design and the interpretation of results. Core 2 will provide biospecimens banking for the samples produced by all projects in the course of clinical trials; these samples will be used for the generation of primagrafts in immunodeficient mice. Samples from the biospecimens bank as well as xenograft samples will, in turn, be available for use by the PI's of all projects.

The extensive scientific and clinical resources at the Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center (DF/HCC) will be leveraged – marshaling local expertise in cell and molecular biology, genetics, immunology, biostatistics, chemistry, murine models, and clinical trial development – in order to perform innovative pre-clinical studies, to validate novel drug targets in patient cells, and to design and implement clinical trials that will eventually lead to improved outcomes for patients with myeloid malignancies. Each of the four Projects will promote detailed analysis of a promising new target by a combination of pre-clinical studies to optimize therapeutic development and early-stage clinical trials. Project 1 leverages recent exciting data from the laboratory of Dr. Scott Armstrong regarding the efficacy of targeting the MLL-menin interaction, which is essential for maintaining HOXA expression and maintenance of leukemia stem cells.

Our objective is to improve the standard of care through the use of targeted therapies for this type of cancer. Towards this end, basic scientists from Harvard Medical School have joined with clinical/translational investigators from Brigham and Women's Hospital, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Massachusetts General Hospital. This initiative is supported by central cores for Pathology, Biostatistics and Administration and includes career and developmental programs. The study plan uses clinical materials and exploits a number of clinical trials to attack glioblastoma on four distinct fronts: Project one targets the tumor vascular system. A cancer biologist, Rakesh Jain, PhD and a neurooncologist, Tracy Batchelor, MD address a current impasse in vascular-based therapies for glioblastoma. Why are patient responses to bevacizumab generally transient and marginal? Jain and Batchelor will test the hypothesis that responses to VEGF pathway inhibitors can be augmented by concurrent or sequential suppression of the angiopoietin-2 signal transduction pathway. Project two targets the PISK signaling axis - a signaling pathway that is activated in ~50% of glioblastomas. Biochemist Tom Roberts, PhD (a co-discoverer of PI3K) and neuro-oncologist Patrick Wen, MD address fundamental issues regarding PISK signaling in glioblastoma that - when resolved - will greatly optimize the treatment of these tumors with small molecule antagonists of PISK. Project three targets the IDH pathway. Malignant gliomas, including glioblastomas, may harbor gain-offunction mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDHI) resulting in accumulation of 2-hydroxyglutarate (2- HG) promoting tumorigenesis. Molecular biologist William Kaelin, MD and neurosurgeon Daniel Cahill, MD, PhD will use clinical material to test the hypothesis that non-invasive measurement of 2-HG levels can serve as a surrogate for IDH mutant enzyme activity, and that targeting of IDH mutation and 2-HG can afford a breakthrough treatment for malignant glioma patients. Project four attacks the Olig2 transcription factor. Molecular biologist Chuck Stiles, PhD has demonstrated an oppositional relationship between the gliogenic transcription factor Olig2 and p53. Building upon these findings, Stiles and radiation oncologist Jay Loeffler, MD will use clinical materials to test the hypothesis that suppression of Olig2 will enhance radiation sensitivity of the major population of glioblastomas (-75%) that retain a structurally intact pSS gene.",Accounting;Address;Adult;Adult Glioblastoma;Age-Years;Angiopoietin-2;Animal Model;Area;Biomedical Engineering;Biometry;Blood;Blood Vessels;Brain;Brain Neoplasms;Cancer Center;Cancer Etiology;Cause of Death;Cell Line;Cell physiology;Cells;Cessation of life;Chromatin Structure;Clinical;Clinical Research;Clinical Trials;Communities;Comprehensive Cancer Center;Consent Forms;Core Facility;Dana-Farber Cancer Institute;Development;Dioxygenases;Disease;Doctor of Philosophy;Drug Targeting;Enrollment;Enzymes;Funding;Gene Expression;General Hospitals;Genes;Genomics;Glioblastoma;Glioma;Hospitals;Human;Human Genome;Image;Imaging technology;Institutes;Institutional Review Boards;Isocitrate Dehydrogenase;Lipids;Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy;Malignant Glioma;Malignant Neoplasms;Massachusetts;Measurement;Metric;Molecular;Mus;Mutation;Neurosurgeon;New Approaches to Brain Tumor Therapy Consortium;North American Brain Tumor Consortium;Oncologist;Other Genetics;Outcome;PTEN gene;Pathology;Pathway interactions;Patients;Penetrance;Phosphotransferases;Population;Production;Protein Isoforms;Proteins;Protocols documentation;Public Health Schools;Radiation;Radiation Oncologist;Radiation Tolerance;Recurrence;Research;Research Personnel;Resistance;Resources;Scientist;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;Signal Transduction Pathway;Teaching Hospitals;Testing;Therapeutic;Tissue Banking;Tissue Banks;United States National Institutes of Health;Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors;Vascular System;Visit;Woman;Work;Xenograft procedure;alpha ketoglutarate;angiogenesis;base;bevacizumab;cancer type;career;clinical material;enzyme activity;gain of function;gain of function mutation;improved;in vivo;inhibitor/antagonist;loss of function;medical schools;men;middle age;mutant;neuro-oncology;new technology;novel;programs;response;small molecule;standard of care;temozolomide;therapeutic target;transcription factor;tumor;tumorigenesis,Tracy T Batchelor,Julia T Arnold,2150500,2150500,2013-09-19T12:09:00Z,2013-09-19T12:09:00Z,2018-07-31T12:07:00Z,PAR-10-003,award_P50CA165962,massachusetts general hospital,BOSTON,MA,UNITED STATES,spore_targeted_therapies_for_glioma,org_name,True

Our objective is to improve the standard of care for children, young adults, and adults with these tumors through the use of targeted therapies. Towards this end, basic scientists from Harvard Medical School and the Broad Institute join with clinical/translational investigators from Boston Children’s Hospital, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Massachusetts General Hospital. There are four projects: Project One targets pediatric low-grade astrocytomas (PLGAs). Nearly 75% of PLGAs are driven by activating mutations in the BRAF protein kinase. Clinician/scientists Daphne Haas-Kogan, M.D. and Karen Wright, M.D. together with structural biologist Michael Eck, M.D., Ph.D. will develop and test brain-penetrant targeted therapeutics for BRAF-mutant PLGAs. Project Two targets IDH-mutant gliomas which present typically in young adults. IDH-mutant gliomas produce extraordinarily high levels of the ‘oncometabolite’ R-2- hydroxyglutarate (2-HG). However, therapeutic exploitation of the differential 2-HG content between normal and malignant brain tissue has yet to be realized. Neurosurgeon Daniel Cahill, M.D., Ph.D. and cancer biologist William Kaelin, M.D. will address this therapeutic lacuna. Project Three targets adult gliomas. Recent studies by basic scientist Jean Zhao, Ph.D. show that in addition to suppressing cell cycle progression, CDK4/6 antagonists promote anti-tumor immunity and synergistically enhance the response to checkpoint inhibitors. Going forward, Dr. Zhao together with neuro-oncologist Patrick Wen, M.D. will test the hypothesis that brain penetrant CDK4/6 inhibitors can augment immunotherapeutic approaches to GBM. Project Four targets the neuronal microenvironment of adult and pediatric gliomas. Neuro-oncologist and developmental neurobiologist Michelle Monje, M.D., Ph.D. has shown that neurons promote glioma growth through activity- regulated secretion of neuroligin-3 (NLGN3) into the tumor microenvironment. Basic scientist Mario Suva, M.D, Ph.D. has refined methods for single cell sequencing of the multiple cell types within the microenvironment of freshly resected human gliomas. Working together, Monje and Suva will define the molecular mechanisms whereby microenvironmental NLGN3 modulates formation and progression of gliomas and explore a novel therapeutic opportunity embedded within the NLGN3 requirement.

3P50CA165962-07S1,P50CA165962,10136362,2020,SPORE: Targeted Therapies for Glioma - Diversity Supplement,"Abstract Glioblastoma is the most common and the most malignant primary brain tumor with a median life expectancy of 15 months despite multimodal therapy. Its aggressive nature is in part due to its ability to escape immune surveillance and to redundant cell signaling that makes it resistant to single-agent targeted therapies. The cyclin D1-CDK4/6- retinoblastoma signaling axis has been implicated in cancer immune evasion and resistance to receptor tyrosine kinase inhibition in multiple cancers. As this axis is deregulated in 80% of glioblastoma, there is ongoing research into whether inhibition of CDK4/6 sensitizes glioblastoma to immunotherapy. This project builds on this work by exploring the role of the epigenetic machinery that is downstream of CDK4/6 signaling on glioblastoma immune evasion, as well as the role of CDK4/6 signaling on resistance to EGFR inhibition. To that end, we will determine whether inhibition of the polycomb repressor complex 2 (PRC2) or of the DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) triggers tumor cell-intrinsic anti-tumor immunity, and whether PRC2 or DNMT inhibitors synergize with immune checkpoint blockade in novel immunocompetent patient-derived models of glioblastoma. We will also determine whether combination EGFR and CDK4/6 inhibition synergize in a genetically engineered mouse model of glioblastoma driven by EGFRvIII, the most common EGFR mutation in human glioblastoma. We hope that this work will uncover rational combinations of targeted therapies or targeted therapies with immunotherapy that will serve as new therapeutic strategies for patients with glioblastoma.",CDK4 gene;Combined Modality Therapy;Cyclin D1;DNA Methyltransferase Inhibitor;DNA Modification Methylases;EGFR inhibition;Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor;Epigenetic Process;Genetically Engineered Mouse;Glioblastoma;Glioma;Human;Immune Evasion;Immunocompetent;Immunologic Surveillance;Immunotherapy;Life Expectancy;Malignant - descriptor;Malignant Neoplasms;Mediating;Modeling;Mutation;Nature;Patients;Polycomb;Primary Brain Neoplasms;Protein Tyrosine Kinase;Repressor Proteins;Research;Resistance;Retinoblastoma;Role;Signal Transduction;Tumor Escape;Tumor Immunity;Work;cancer therapy;epidermal growth factor receptor VIII;immune checkpoint blockade;immune resistance;inhibitor/antagonist;neoplastic cell;novel;novel therapeutic intervention;receptor;targeted agent;targeted treatment,Tracy T Batchelor,Hector Nelson Aguila,264010,264010,2020-09-15T12:09:00Z,2013-09-19T12:09:00Z,2024-08-31T12:08:00Z,PA-18-906,award_P50CA165962,brigham and women's hospital,BOSTON,MA,UNITED STATES,spore_targeted_therapies_for_glioma,org_name,True

Our objective is to improve the standard of care for children, young adults, and adults with these tumors through the use of targeted therapies. Towards this end, basic scientists from Harvard Medical School and the Broad Institute join with clinical/translational investigators from Boston Children’s Hospital, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Massachusetts General Hospital. There are four projects: Project One targets pediatric low-grade astrocytomas (PLGAs). Nearly 75% of PLGAs are driven by activating mutations in the BRAF protein kinase. Clinician/scientists Daphne Haas-Kogan, M.D. and Karen Wright, M.D. together with structural biologist Michael Eck, M.D., Ph.D. will develop and test brain-penetrant targeted therapeutics for BRAF-mutant PLGAs. Project Two targets IDH-mutant gliomas which present typically in young adults. IDH-mutant gliomas produce extraordinarily high levels of the ‘oncometabolite’ R-2- hydroxyglutarate (2-HG). However, therapeutic exploitation of the differential 2-HG content between normal and malignant brain tissue has yet to be realized. Neurosurgeon Daniel Cahill, M.D., Ph.D. and cancer biologist William Kaelin, M.D. will address this therapeutic lacuna. Project Three targets adult gliomas. Recent studies by basic scientist Jean Zhao, Ph.D. show that in addition to suppressing cell cycle progression, CDK4/6 antagonists promote anti-tumor immunity and synergistically enhance the response to checkpoint inhibitors. Going forward, Dr. Zhao together with neuro-oncologist Patrick Wen, M.D. will test the hypothesis that brain penetrant CDK4/6 inhibitors can augment immunotherapeutic approaches to GBM. Project Four targets the neuronal microenvironment of adult and pediatric gliomas. Neuro-oncologist and developmental neurobiologist Michelle Monje, M.D., Ph.D. has shown that neurons promote glioma growth through activity- regulated secretion of neuroligin-3 (NLGN3) into the tumor microenvironment. Basic scientist Mario Suva, M.D, Ph.D. has refined methods for single cell sequencing of the multiple cell types within the microenvironment of freshly resected human gliomas. Working together, Monje and Suva will define the molecular mechanisms whereby microenvironmental NLGN3 modulates formation and progression of gliomas and explore a novel therapeutic opportunity embedded within the NLGN3 requirement.

Our objective is to improve the standard of care through the use of targeted therapies for this type of cancer. Towards this end, basic scientists from Harvard Medical School have joined with clinical/translational investigators from Brigham and Women's Hospital, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Massachusetts General Hospital. This initiative is supported by central cores for Pathology, Biostatistics and Administration and includes career and developmental programs. The study plan uses clinical materials and exploits a number of clinical trials to attack glioblastoma on four distinct fronts: Project one targets the tumor vascular system. A cancer biologist, Rakesh Jain, PhD and a neurooncologist, Tracy Batchelor, MD address a current impasse in vascular-based therapies for glioblastoma. Why are patient responses to bevacizumab generally transient and marginal? Jain and Batchelor will test the hypothesis that responses to VEGF pathway inhibitors can be augmented by concurrent or sequential suppression of the angiopoietin-2 signal transduction pathway. Project two targets the PI3K signaling axis - a signaling pathway that is activated in ~50% of glioblastomas. Biochemist Tom Roberts, PhD (a co-discoverer of PI3K) and neuro-oncologist Patrick Wen, MD address fundamental issues regarding PI3K signaling in glioblastoma that - when resolved - will greatly optimize the treatment of these tumors with small molecule antagonists of PI3K. Project three targets the IDH pathway.

Our objective is to improve the standard of care for children, young adults, and adults with these tumors through the use of targeted therapies. Towards this end, basic scientists from Harvard Medical School and the Broad Institute join with clinical/translational investigators from Boston Children’s Hospital, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Massachusetts General Hospital. There are four projects: Project One targets pediatric low-grade astrocytomas (PLGAs). Nearly 75% of PLGAs are driven by activating mutations in the BRAF protein kinase. Clinician/scientists Daphne Haas-Kogan, M.D. and Karen Wright, M.D. together with structural biologist Michael Eck, M.D., Ph.D. will develop and test brain-penetrant targeted therapeutics for BRAF-mutant PLGAs. Project Two targets IDH-mutant gliomas which present typically in young adults. IDH-mutant gliomas produce extraordinarily high levels of the ‘oncometabolite’ R-2- hydroxyglutarate (2-HG). However, therapeutic exploitation of the differential 2-HG content between normal and malignant brain tissue has yet to be realized. Neurosurgeon Daniel Cahill, M.D., Ph.D. and cancer biologist William Kaelin, M.D. will address this therapeutic lacuna. Project Three targets adult gliomas. Recent studies by basic scientist Jean Zhao, Ph.D. show that in addition to suppressing cell cycle progression, CDK4/6 antagonists promote anti-tumor immunity and synergistically enhance the response to checkpoint inhibitors. Going forward, Dr. Zhao together with neuro-oncologist Patrick Wen, M.D. will test the hypothesis that brain penetrant CDK4/6 inhibitors can augment immunotherapeutic approaches to GBM. Project Four targets the neuronal microenvironment of adult and pediatric gliomas. Neuro-oncologist and developmental neurobiologist Michelle Monje, M.D., Ph.D. has shown that neurons promote glioma growth through activity- regulated secretion of neuroligin-3 (NLGN3) into the tumor microenvironment. Basic scientist Mario Suva, M.D, Ph.D. has refined methods for single cell sequencing of the multiple cell types within the microenvironment of freshly resected human gliomas. Working together, Monje and Suva will define the molecular mechanisms whereby microenvironmental NLGN3 modulates formation and progression of gliomas and explore a novel therapeutic opportunity embedded within the NLGN3 requirement. Rigor and reproducibility of work conducted in the four projects will be fostered by cores for Pathology and for Biostatistics and Computational Biology. An Administration core will enable and manage the multiple consortium agreements and collaborative interactions between Harvard Medical School, the four participating Harvard teaching hospitals and facilitate clinical trials and imaging studies.

Pathologically, BC is diagnosed as non-muscle-invasive (NMI) and muscle-invasive (MI) disease. Here we define early bladder lesions as NMIBC. Major clinical gaps in NMIBC include i) lack of mechanistic insights defining NMIBC progression, and ii) lack of platform for risk stratification of NMIBC that recur but never progress (“non-progressors”), from those that progresses into MIBC (“progressors”) and consequently demonstrate poor prognosis. The goal of our Center is to tackle this clinical issue by deciphering the underlying mechanisms restraining or promoting the progression of early lesions (Project 1 & 2), and to leverage this novel biology as candidate biomarkers to risk-stratify aggressive NMIBC (Project 3). This proposal seeks to shift the current research paradigm in the field of NMIBC, by proposing a conceptually innovative tug-of-war between a tumor- restraining (Project 1) and a tumor-promoting mechanism (Project 2) in determining the outcome of early bladder lesions/NMIBC in becoming “progressors” or “non-progressors” (Project 3). Clinically, why “non-progressors” often recur but seldom progress, and what are the driving forces advancing “progressors” into MIBC with poor survival remain fundamental questions in field. Our tug-of-war hypothesis with two opposing forces is conceptually different to most other studies, which primarily focus on one side of the coin. Further, the integration of knowledge from Project 1 and 2 as a unified spatial proteomics and transcriptomics map by the Shared Resource Core will reveal spatial and temporal relationships between distinct fibroblast populations with opposing functions, their physical interactions with tumor and immune cell clusters, as well as their relationship to the biomarkers from Project 3. Benchmark of success: The knowledge gained here will shift clinical practice paradigm, by informing future NIMBC management through 1) the development of novel urinary profiling strategies that could risk stratify aggressive NMIBC (Project 1-3); 2) the identification of targets for future precision intervention, either by enhancing/sustaining the tumor-restraining mechanisms (Project 1) and/or inhibiting the tumor-promoting mechanisms (Project 2). The overall success of our program is further ensured by an extraordinary multi-investigator team that integrates three “organ-specific” bladder cancer investigators within Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. All have active R01s and individual NCI-funding track record in performing basic science research, translational bladder cancer research, or leading multi-center clinical trials on the discovery and validation of biomarkers.

However, the late effects of cancer treatment, including permanent organ and tissue damage, hormonal and reproductive dysfunction and second cancers, are of special concern, with more than 40% of the estimated 360,000 survivors of childhood cancer experiencing a significant health-related quality of life complication from childhood cancer and its treatment. In addition, progress for a number of childhood cancers remains limited with approximately 50% of children with acute myelogenous leukemia, 50% of children with high-risk neuroblastoma, and more than 90% of children with brainstem glioma, still succumbing to their disease. The Children’s Oncology Group (COG), the world’s largest organization devoted exclusively to childhood and adolescent cancer research, and its multidisciplinary research teams comprised of more than 9,000 members, conducts research at more than 220 leading children’s hospitals, universities, and cancer centers. This proposal is for the COG NCI Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP) Research Base to continue its collaborative research work for our 26 community and 16 minority/underserved NCORP sites.

Precision cancer medicine, which seeks to exploit unique cellular, molecular and genetic characteristics of individual tumors to optimize treatment, remains a critically unmet need. Despite advances in biomarker technologies that yield high-quality cellular and genomic data, critical gaps remain to consistently match patients with cancer and ideal therapies. While `predictive' genomic assays based on RNA and DNA are now commonplace, current methods largely ignore tumor phenotypes differentiable by quantitative imaging. The overarching vision for VU-PREDICT is a suite of quantitative imaging tools that facilitate the discovery of novel, predictive imaging-derived gene expression signatures; such signatures can be deployed by the greater oncology community to improve the personalization of cancer treatment. The linchpin of VU-PREDICT will be positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. The sensitive and quantitative nature of PET, coupled with the ability to produce biologically active PET tracers, renders PET uniquely capable of both detecting tumors and profiling their specific features. Complementary to genomic approaches, PET imaging provides a quantitative, functional measure of tumor phenotype, and when coupled biopsy approaches, can provide a significantly greater breadth of biological characterization. VU-PREDICT centers on a parallel co-clinical trial of patients with advanced colorectal cancer (CRC) and human-in-mouse PDX (patient-derived xenograft) models. CRC is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs; cetuximab, panitumumab) are approved for treatment of advanced wild-type (WT) RAS CRC.

1U54CA209978-01A1,U54CA209978,9350520,2017,Combating Subclonal Evolution of Resistant Cancer Phenotypes,"Overall abstract Our Cancer Systems Biology Center of HoPE (Heterogeneity of Phenotypic Evolution) will develop a suite of systems-based methodologies to understand how genomic diversity, clonal evolution, and phenotypic change . To evaluate their potential for translation, we will integrate these dynamic models with clinical trials that will evaluate whether these phenotypic changes can be targeted for therapy. We hypothesize that acquired resistance emerges from selection acting on phenotypes during tumor evolution, and that simultaneously measuring and modeling subclone genotypes and phenotypes will identify new, and testable, therapeutic targets. Selective pressures from therapy and the tumor microenvironment can propel subclones from every patient's tumor along an evolutionary trajectory that leads to resistance. Indeed, our data shows that both genetic and phenotypic diversity among tumor subclones evolves as cancer cells progress to a resistant state. However, it is not yet known the specific phenotypes that promote that resistant state, the interactions among them, and how they converge to common resistant phenotypes seen in late stage cancer. To address these and other questions, we will develop a new class of dynamical systems models of subclone evolution to characterize the changes and development of key cell states that arise during acquired chemo-resistance and metastasis using our unique patient cohorts. These mechanistic models will identify points of therapeutic vulnerability that we will test in clinical trials aimed at blocking evolution to a resistant state by targeting critical resistant phenotypes. Our Center is comprised of an Administrative, Education/Outreach, Translational, and Computational Cores, in addition to two complementary projects. The synergies are derived from: 1) the convergent parameterization of the evolutionary models drawn from deep longitudinal patient progression studies (Project 1) and broad multisite metastatic tumor analyses (Project 2), resulting in a robust model to identify resistant states for clinical targeting; and 2) an integrated computational and experimental framework and resources for dissecting tumor heterogeneity and evolution that will contribute to an improved capacity for personalized cancer therapy. Our multidisciplinary team of systems biologists, bioinformaticians, tumor biologists, pharmacologists, mathematical biologists, and clinicians will tackle these scientific challenges.

To evaluate their potential for translation, we will integrate these dynamic models with clinical trials that will evaluate whether these phenotypic changes can be targeted for therapy. We hypothesize that acquired resistance emerges from selection acting on phenotypes during tumor evolution, and that simultaneously measuring and modeling subclone genotypes and phenotypes will identify new, and testable, therapeutic targets. Selective pressures from therapy and the tumor microenvironment can propel subclones from every patient's tumor along an evolutionary trajectory that leads to resistance. Indeed, our data shows that both genetic and phenotypic diversity among tumor subclones evolves as cancer cells progress to a resistant state. However, it is not yet known the specific phenotypes that promote that resistant state, the interactions among them, and how they converge to common resistant phenotypes seen in late stage cancer. To address these and other questions, we will develop a new class of dynamical systems models of subclone evolution to characterize the changes and development of key cell states that arise during acquired chemo-resistance and metastasis using our unique patient cohorts. These mechanistic models will identify points of therapeutic vulnerability that we will test in clinical trials aimed at blocking evolution to a resistant state by targeting critical resistant phenotypes. Our Center is comprised of an Administrative, Education/Outreach, Translational, and Computational Cores, in addition to two complementary projects. The synergies are derived from: 1) the convergent parameterization of the evolutionary models drawn from deep longitudinal patient progression studies (Project 1) and broad multisite metastatic tumor analyses (Project 2), resulting in a robust model to identify resistant states for clinical targeting; and 2) an integrated computational and experimental framework and resources for dissecting tumor heterogeneity and evolution that will contribute to an improved capacity for personalized cancer therapy.

These efforts have uncovered a staggering level of genome complexity in cancer. Although much is known about the function and clinical impact of recurrent aberrations in well-known cancer genes, less is known about which and how the more abundant, low-frequency mutations contribute to tumor progression. Effective translation of tumor genomic datasets into cancer therapeutics will require new experimental systems to inform the functional activity of targets in the relevant biological context encompassing inter- and intra-tumoral heterogeneity. To address these needs, we propose a CTD2 Center that will provide the research community high-throughput informatic and experimental approaches to characterize and validate pathogenic “driver” mutations and fusion genes as well as identify molecular markers that meaningfully predict responses or resistance to anticancer therapies. We will pursue the following Specific Aims: In Aim 1 we will implement an algorithmic framework for identifying driver mutations with high sensitivity and specificity. We will focus our algorithm development, training and testing efforts on predicting oncogenic, gain-of-function mutation drivers of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). These computational approaches will be amenable to the analysis of all cancer types. We will next engineer ~1,500 selected mutations and ~400 fusion genes into expression vectors along with cohorts of personalized, patient-defined coding mutations. In Aim 2 we will enter mutant alleles and fusion genes into GBM, PDAC and EOC context-specific, in vivo functional screens that take into account the importance of genetic context, tumor microenvironment and heterogeneity in the selection of single and combinatorial drivers of tumorigenesis. In Aim 3 we will determine the consequences of intra-tumoral heterogeneity on tumor sensitivity and resistance to therapeutic agents using DNA-barcoded, human patient-derived xenograft models that recapitulate the heterogeneity of cancer. We will determine the extent to which single targeted agents and their rational combinations alter tumor population dynamics. We will also leverage Aim 1 informatics and functional characterizations in Aim 2 and 4 to characterize “persistor” populations to identify aberrations associated with drug resistance. In Aim 4 we will use high-throughput functional proteomics, innovative protein- protein interaction assays and informer drug library screening studies to elucidate underlying mechanisms and therapeutic liabilities engendered by validated drivers.

We will focus our algorithm development, training and testing efforts on predicting oncogenic, gain-of-function mutation drivers of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). These computational approaches will be amenable to the analysis of all cancer types. We will next engineer ~1,500 selected mutations and ~400 fusion genes into expression vectors along with cohorts of personalized, patient-defined coding mutations. In Aim 2 we will enter mutant alleles and fusion genes into GBM, PDAC and EOC context-specific, in vivo functional screens that take into account the importance of genetic context, tumor microenvironment and heterogeneity in the selection of single and combinatorial drivers of tumorigenesis. In Aim 3 we will determine the consequences of intra-tumoral heterogeneity on tumor sensitivity and resistance to therapeutic agents using DNA-barcoded, human patient-derived xenograft models that recapitulate the heterogeneity of cancer. We will determine the extent to which single targeted agents and their rational combinations alter tumor population dynamics. We will also leverage Aim 1 informatics and functional characterizations in Aim 2 and 4 to characterize “persistor” populations to identify aberrations associated with drug resistance. In Aim 4 we will use high-throughput functional proteomics, innovative protein- protein interaction assays and informer drug library screening studies to elucidate underlying mechanisms and therapeutic liabilities engendered by validated drivers.

In this fifth competitive application, the GLNE continues to test the overall hypothesis that a panel of circulating and stool based biomarkers will increase the adherence to colorectal screening and in doing so reduce mortality caused by colorectal cancers. Based on the rising incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) among adults age <50 in the US, and the low compliance and high mortality in underserved populations, increased emphasis is placed on these populations. The GLNE also proposes to continue its ongoing support of EDRN discovery priorities. We propose to address the following aims: (1) Primary Aim To expand and renew the archive of appropriately preserved stool, serum, plasma, urine, tissue and DNA biospecimens to be used by EDRN investigators for current and future validation and biomarker discovery research with expanded inclusion of subjects with early-onset CRC and underserved populations. This will allow assessment of the utility of individual stool-based, and serum-based biomarkers and biomarker panels for discriminating between individuals without neoplasia (subjects both at average and higher risk for developing colon cancer), and those with colon cancer or screen-relevant neoplasia (cancer plus advanced adenoma), and construction of panels of markers to discriminate between these groups. (2) To perform validation trials of promising biomarkers discovered by EDRN investigators, external collaborating institutions and collaborating EDRN industrial partners for the early detection of colorectal neoplasia. In this context we propose to (a) to clinically validate (via a methods comparison study) the performance of a point-of-care blood- based biomarker panel with the testing of serum/plasma samples obtained in clinics serving low-income and underserved communities and (b) to clinically validate an established 4-plex stool protein panel for early diagnosis of CRC. (3) To follow prospectively subjects enrolled in an established prospective Phase 2 validation trial to identify pre-diagnostic specimens which may be used to develop predictive markers.",Address;Adenocarcinoma;Adherence;Adult;African American population;Age;Archives;Biological Markers;Blood;Clinic;Clinical;Clinical Data;Colon Carcinoma;Colonoscopy;Colorectal;Colorectal Cancer;Colorectal Neoplasms;DNA;Development;Diagnostic;Early Detection Research Network;Early Diagnosis;Enrollment;Feces;Future;High grade dysplasia;Incidence;Individual;Industrialization;Institution;Link;Low income;Malignant Neoplasms;Malignant neoplasm of gastrointestinal tract;Methods;Morbidity - disease rate;Neoplasms;New England;Participant;Patients;Performance;Phase;Plasma;Population;Prevalence;Procedures;Proteins;Research;Research Personnel;Risk Assessment;Sampling;Serum;Specimen;Testing;Tissues;Tubulovillous Adenoma;Underserved Population;Urine;Validation;Villous Adenoma;adenoma;base;biomarker discovery;biomarker panel;blood-based biomarker;candidate marker;circulating biomarkers;colorectal cancer screening;cost;early detection biomarkers;early onset colorectal cancer;follow-up;high risk;mortality;point of care;predictive marker;preservation;prospective;response;sample collection;screening;sex;stool sample;underserved community,Robert S Bresalier; Sapna Syngal,Jo Ann S.

5U01CA086400-22,U01CA086400,10698103,2023,Great Lakes New England Clinical Validation Center,"The Great Lakes New England Clinical Validation Center (GLNE CVC), a Clinical Validation Consortium component of the Early Detection Research Network (EDRN) is a highly collaborative group of investigators whose aims to validate biomarkers for the early detection and risk assessment of cancers of the gastrointestinal tract. In this fifth competitive application, the GLNE continues to test the overall hypothesis that a panel of circulating and stool based biomarkers will increase the adherence to colorectal screening and in doing so reduce mortality caused by colorectal cancers. Based on the rising incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) among adults age <50 in the US, and the low compliance and high mortality in underserved populations, increased emphasis is placed on these populations. The GLNE also proposes to continue its ongoing support of EDRN discovery priorities. We propose to address the following aims: (1) Primary Aim To expand and renew the archive of appropriately preserved stool, serum, plasma, urine, tissue and DNA biospecimens to be used by EDRN investigators for current and future validation and biomarker discovery research with expanded inclusion of subjects with early-onset CRC and underserved populations. This will allow assessment of the utility of individual stool-based, and serum-based biomarkers and biomarker panels for discriminating between individuals without neoplasia (subjects both at average and higher risk for developing colon cancer), and those with colon cancer or screen-relevant neoplasia (cancer plus advanced adenoma), and construction of panels of markers to discriminate between these groups. (2) To perform validation trials of promising biomarkers discovered by EDRN investigators, external collaborating institutions and collaborating EDRN industrial partners for the early detection of colorectal neoplasia. In this context we propose to (a) to clinically validate (via a methods comparison study) the performance of a point-of-care blood- based biomarker panel with the testing of serum/plasma samples obtained in clinics serving low-income and underserved communities and (b) to clinically validate an established 4-plex stool protein panel for early diagnosis of CRC. (3) To follow prospectively subjects enrolled in an established prospective Phase 2 validation trial to identify pre-diagnostic specimens which may be used to develop predictive markers.",Address;Adenocarcinoma;Adherence;Adult;African American population;Age;Archives;Biological Markers;Blood;Clinic;Clinical;Clinical Data;Collaborations;Colon;Colon Carcinoma;Colonoscopy;Colorectal;Colorectal Cancer;Colorectal Neoplasms;DNA;Development;Diagnostic;Early Detection Research Network;Early Diagnosis;Enrollment;Feces;Future;High grade dysplasia;Incidence;Individual;Industrialization;Institution;Link;Low income;Malignant Neoplasms;Malignant neoplasm of gastrointestinal tract;Methods;Morbidity - disease rate;Neoplasms;New England;Participant;Patients;Performance;Phase;Plasma;Population;Prevalence;Procedures;Proteins;Research;Research Personnel;Risk Assessment;Sampling;Serum;Specimen;Testing;Tissues;Tubulovillous Adenoma;Underserved Population;Urine;Validation;Villous Adenoma;adenoma;biomarker discovery;biomarker panel;biomarker validation;blood-based biomarker;candidate marker;circulating biomarkers;colorectal cancer screening;cost;early detection biomarkers;early onset colorectal cancer;follow-up;high risk;mortality;point of care;predictive marker;preservation;prospective;response;sample collection;screening;sex;stool sample;underserved community,Robert S Bresalier; Sapna Syngal,Matthew R Young,1016923,1016923,2023-09-08T12:09:00Z,2000-05-15T12:05:00Z,2027-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-21-033,nofo_CA-21-033,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,houston,TX,UNITED STATES,edrn,org_city,False
1U01CA271277-01,U01CA271277,10450916,2022,TeleHealth Resistance exercise Intervention to preserve dose intensity and Vitality in Elder breast cancer patients (THRIVE),"Project Summary/Abstract More than 276,480 women were diagnosed with breast cancer in 2020, with 120,000 cases occurring in women 65 years or older. Given the increasing median age of the US population, the number of breast cancers diagnosed in older women is expected to rise by 50% in the coming decades. Older women with breast cancer experience worse breast cancer-specific outcomes as compared to younger women, under-treatment is likely to play a central role. Studies have demonstrated that breast cancer patients who receive <85% of received dose intensity (RDI), a metric that combines the total dose administered with adherence to the planned treatment schedule, have a 57% increase in the risk of disease recurrence at 10 years as compared to women who receive at least 85% RDI. Only 50-76% of breast cancer patients >65 receive an RDI >85, largely due to increased toxicity of therapy in these patients. Reducing treatment-related toxicity to enhance RDI is critical to improving disease outcomes among the growing population of older breast cancer patients. To this end, models predicting for severe chemotoxicity demonstrate that a number of potentially modifiable factors (commonly assessed as part of the geriatric assessment), are important determinants of chemotoxicity, including function, depression, and falls (or use of assistive devices). Exercise has a significant positive impact on each of these modifiable factors, in the general population and in cancer patients. However, data on the ability of exercise interventions to improve treatment tolerance and preserve dose intensity among older breast cancer patients are lacking. We propose a randomized controlled trial to assess the effects of a multicomponent, hybrid telehealth (TH) exercise and protein intake support (the THRIVE Intervention) on RDI, incidence and severity of chemotoxicities, functional status, muscle mass, and patient reported outcomes in 270 breast cancer patients age ≥ 65 receiving neo/adjuvant chemotherapy. Participants will be randomized to the THRIVE Intervention or to a Health Education and Support control group. The intervention will be delivered through a hybrid model, leveraging the existing Breast Cancer Weight Loss (BWEL) Trial call center. After 2 in-person, onsite exercise sessions, we will transition to TH sessions delivered on study provided tablets, by certified exercise coaches who will tailor behavior change to support adherence relative to symptom burden. To optimize intervention effectiveness, participants will undergo a TH evaluation of diet adequacy with a registered dietitian, focused on optimal daily protein intake. Protein supplementation will be provided if needed to achieve 1.2 gm/kg daily intake. The TH focus consolidates expertise at a well-established call center (BWEL), elevating the potential for broad implementation across the U.S., including cancer treatment centers with too few patients to justify necessary personnel. The project also seeks to evaluate intervention cost, as well as the facilitators and barriers to implementation of this TH intervention, toward the goal of translation to clinical practice upon successful completion of the THRIVE trial.",Adherence;Adjuvant Chemotherapy;Administrator;Age;Attenuated;Body Weight decreased;Breast Cancer Patient;Breast Cancer Treatment;Cancer Patient;Caring;Control Groups;Data;Diagnosis;Diet;Dietitian;Disease Outcome;Dose;Dose-Limiting;Effectiveness of Interventions;Elderly;Elements;Etiology;Evaluation;Exercise;Fatigue;General Population;Geriatric Assessment;Goals;Health education;Human Resources;Hybrids;Incidence;Inferior;Intake;Intervention;Mental Depression;Modeling;Nutrient;Older Population;Oncology;Outcome;Participant;Patient Outcomes Assessments;Patients;Persons;Physical Function;Play;Population;Proteins;Quality of life;Randomized;Randomized Controlled Trials;Recurrence;Risk;Role;SEER Program;Self-Help Devices;Severities;Sleep;Supplementation;Symptoms;Tablets;Therapeutic;Time;Toxic effect;Translations;Treatment Protocols;Treatment outcome;Treatment-related toxicity;Woman;aged;behavior change;breast cancer diagnosis;cancer therapy;chemotherapy;clinical practice;cost;disorder risk;exercise intervention;experience;falls;functional status;human old age (65+);implementation barriers;implementation intervention;improved;improved outcome;intervention cost;malignant breast neoplasm;member;mortality;muscle form;older women;predictive modeling;preservation;programs;protein intake;psychologic;psychosocial;resistance exercise;telehealth;treatment center;treatment planning;young woman,Nathan A.

1R21CA231904-01,R21CA231904,9604117,2018,An Ontology-driven Faceted Query Engine for the Kentucky Cancer Registry,"ABSTRACT A key barrier in cancer research is the traditional data access workflow that requires a hypothesis prior to accessing patient data, rather than a workflow that begins with data exploration while protecting privacy. Existing query engines allow researchers to explore clinical data, build queries, and execute queries without the need for the user to understand how the data is stored. However, the interfaces of such query engines have not achieved usability approaching the levels of those for consumer websites due in critical part to the lack of faceted capabilities. Faceted systems for querying clinical data is currently unavailable due to the complexity of data and the mismatch between the ontologies used for organizing and annotating clinical data (such as NCI Thesaurus), and the desired facet structures and properties. We propose to overcome these challenges by developing OncoSphere, a query engine using the NCI Thesaurus as a nested facet system (NFS) to provide web-based exploration of the Kentucky Cancer Registry data using 3 Specific Aims. In Aim 1 we will develop an approach to transform and implement NCI Thesaurus into an NFS to enable OncoSphere’s interface features. In Aim 2 we will develop methods to perform quality auditing on the hierarchical structure of the NCI Thesaurus to enhance its quality in supporting faceted query for OncoSphere. In Aim 3 we will perform evaluation on OncoSphere’s query expressiveness, query performance and conduct preliminary usability assessment. OncoSphere will break new ground in web-based tools and capitalize on available data resources to accelerate cancer research. We expect OncoSphere and its future versions to become an invaluable resource for the cancer research community. The long-term goal of this study is to create data exploration systems for NCI’s Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program and other related cancer data resources through data science innovations to transform user experience with a new generation of data interaction modalities.",Address;Adopted;Area;Biomedical Research;Characteristics;Clinical Data;Clinical Research;Clinical Trials;Communities;Computer software;Data;Data Science;Databases;Detection;Development;Ensure;Evaluation;Future;Generations;Goals;Kentucky;Knowledge;Lead;Malignant Neoplasms;Metadata;Methods;Modality;NCI Thesaurus;Online Systems;Ontology;Patients;Performance;Privacy;Property;Research Personnel;Resources;Role;SEER Program;Site;Software Tools;Structure;System;Terminology;Time;Translations;Trees;Work;anticancer research;data access;data integration;data management;data registry;data resource;design;experience;human data;improved;innovation;insight;lexical;neoplasm registry;neoplasm resource;novel;query optimization;sound;success;tool;usability;web app;web site;web-based tool,Licong Cui; Guo-Qiang Zhang,Donna Rivera,187621,187621,2018-06-06T12:06:00Z,2018-06-06T12:06:00Z,2019-02-03T12:02:00Z,PAR-15-334,nofo_PAR-15-334,UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY,lexington,KY,UNITED STATES,itcr,org_city,False
1U01CA220401-01A1,U01CA220401,9507539,2018,Informatics Tools for Quantitative Digital Pathology Profiling and Integrated Prognostic Modeling,"PROJECT SUMMARY Accurate biomarker-driven prognostic stratification, response prediction, and cohort enrichment are critical for realizing precision treatment strategies and population health management approaches that optimize quality of life and survival for cancer patients. Genomics holds promise for improving classification and prognostication of malignancies, yet oncology practice continues to rely heavily on immunohistochemistry (IHC) as a fundamental tool due to its practicality and ability to provide protein-level and subcellular localization information. The goal of this proposal is to create an open-source software resource for the quantitative analysis of IHC stained tissues and effective integration of IHC, genomic, and clinical features for cancer classification and prognostication. This proposal builds on our collective experience in computer-assisted analysis of microscopic images (including IHC images), development of machine-learning methods to address the challenges of classification and prognostication with heterogeneous and high-dimensional data, and leadership in collection and large-scale analysis of cancer outcomes involving collaboration with multiple medical centers. This effort for the first time will create tools to integrate quantitative IHC imaging, clinical, and genomic information that will in turn enable the research community to explore strategies for the classification of malignancies and prediction of outcomes. The proposed tools will be developed and extensively validated in close collaboration with clinical, genomic, and digital pathology data from the NCI-supported Lymphoma Epidemiology of Outcomes (LEO) cohort study. The software tools produced by this proposal will enable the characterization of subcellular protein expression in cell nuclei, membranes and cytoplasmic compartments. Spatial features of protein expression heterogeneity, along with patient-level summaries of protein expression will be used to develop machine-learning classifiers for cancer subtypes, using diffuse large b-cell lymphomas as a driving application. Technology for automatic tuning of machine learning algorithms will enable a broad class of clinically and biologically motivated users to utilize these tools in their investigations. We will also provide an interactive dashboard that enables users to integrate genomic and IHC-based features to explore prognostic models of patient survival. These tools will be released and documented under an open-source model, integrated with HistomicsTK (https://histomicstk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), and available to the broader cancer research community.",Academic Medical Centers;Address;Adopted;Algorithms;Automobile Driving;Behavior;Biological;Cancer Patient;Cancer Prognosis;Cations;Cell Nucleus;Classification;Clinic;Clinical;Clinical Trials;Cohort Studies;Collaborations;Collection;Color;Communities;Computer Assisted;Computer software;Data;Data Set;Decision Trees;Development;Diagnosis;Disease;ERBB2 gene;Enrollment;Epidemiology;Flowers;Genetic Markers;Genomics;Goals;Heterogeneity;Histology;Image;Image Analysis;Immunohistochemistry;Informatics;Institution;Investigation;Leadership;Learning;Letters;Lymphoma;Machine Learning;Malignant Neoplasms;Manuals;Measurement;Medical center;Membrane;Methods;Modeling;Newly Diagnosed;Non-Hodgkin&apos;s Lymphoma;Outcome;Pathologic;Pathologist;Patient-Focused Outcomes;Patients;Precision therapeutics;Prediction of Response to Therapy;Process;Proteins;Quality of life;Reproducibility;Research;Research Personnel;Resources;Science;Site;Software Tools;Stains;Standardization;Stratification;Technology;Testing;Time;Tissue Model;Tissue Stains;Tissues;Variant;Work;anticancer research;base;biomarker-driven;cancer classification;cancer diagnosis;cancer subtypes;cancer survival;clinical practice;clinical research site;cohort;dashboard;data management;design;digital;digital pathology;experience;follow-up;genomic biomarker;genomic data;health management;high dimensionality;improved;interactive tool;large cell Diffuse non-Hodgkin&apos;s lymphoma;learning strategy;malignant breast neoplasm;microscopic imaging;neoplasm resource;oncology;open source;operation;outcome prediction;pathology imaging;patient subsets;population health;predict clinical outcome;predicting response;predictive modeling;prognostic;prognostic value;protein expression;public health relevance;software development;tissue processing;tool;translational scientist;treatment strategy;tumor heterogeneity;whole slide imaging,Lee Cooper; Christopher R Flowers; Metin Nafi Gurcan,Rao L Divi,467872,467872,2018-06-12T12:06:00Z,2018-06-12T12:06:00Z,2021-05-31T12:05:00Z,PAR-15-332,nofo_PAR-15-332,EMORY UNIVERSITY,atlanta,GA,UNITED STATES,itcr,org_city,True

We will leverage and extend an existing training platform and content we have developed. We will improve cancer informatics literacy and the usability of existing ITCR tools, support future ITCR tool developers, and teach informatics to a broad cross-section of interested parties. Our success will both deepen expertise within the field and broaden the exposure of ITCR tools within currently-unengaged research communities. Specifically, we will: (1) develop and release a software platform for rapidly prototyping, validating, and sharing modular training materials that can be delivered in a range of formats from massive online open courses, to in-person short courses, to in depth semester long courses, (2) develop informatics courses teaching not only specific use of ITCR tools to solve concrete scientific challenges but also broadly the concepts of informatics to a broad community ranging from citizen scientists to NCI funded PIs, (3) develop courses for ITCR tool developers around usability, documentation, support and marketing to improve the impact of these tools in the field, and (4) deliver in person and ""train the trainer"" courses that will scale the impact of our educational program both within NIH funded cancer centers and into currently underserved researchers at community colleges, minority serving institutions, historically black colleges and universities, and engaged citizens outside of academia. All software, content, and data developed by our program will be open source and made accessible to the broadest possible audience by leveraging our existing expertise in online and scalable in-person education, along with our relationships to MOOC providers, informatics platforms, and developers. We will thus will dramatically increase cancer informatics knowledge and skill, and speed the adoption and use of data to tackle important problems in cancer throughout the research enterprise.",Academia;Address;Adoption;Cancer Center;Communities;Computer software;Data;Data Analyses;Data Analytics;Data Collection;Data Science;Data Storage and Retrieval;Documentation;Education;Educational process of instructing;Event;Exercise;Explosion;Funding;Future;Galaxy;Geography;Goals;Heart;Historically Black Colleges and Universities;Home environment;Informatics;Institution;Knowledge;Licensing;Location;Malignant Neoplasms;Marketing;Measurement;Medical;Minority-Serving Institution;Persons;Phase Transition;Principal Investigator;Provider;Reproducibility;Research;Research Personnel;Resources;Scientist;Site;Software Tools;Speed;Technology;Time;Trainers Training;Training;United States National Institutes of Health;anticancer research;citizen science;community college;cost;data tools;education resources;experience;improved;informatics tool;informatics training;instructor;interest;learning materials;lectures;literacy;massive open online courses;meetings;member;multimodality;online course;open source;outreach;programs;prototype;skills;software development;success;tool;training opportunity;usability,Jeremy Goecks; Jeffrey T.

2U24CA180996-07,U24CA180996,9722332,2019,Cancer Genomics: Integrative and Salable Solutions in R/Bioconductor,"Abstract Bioconductor is an ecosystem of more than 1,500 open-source software and data packages for the statistical analysis and comprehension of high-throughput genomic data. It is widely used by the cancer genomics research community for statistical analysis and visualization. This software ecosystem is supported by core data classes and methods, reused by both users and developers, that provide convenient representations and efficient operations for many kinds of high-throughput molecular data. Falling sequencing costs and single-cell assays enable increasingly resolved study of the molecular biology of cancer, through combined assaying of DNA sequence, epigenetics, gene expression, protein, and other aspects, even at the single-cell level, for a single specimen. These developments present new challenges in complexity, size, and interpretability of the data. The overarching goal of this project is to create and adapt core Bioconductor software infrastructure to meet these challenges, through the following aims. First, we develop infrastructure for the analysis of single-cell multi-omic experiments. Second, we implement FAIR principles for improved somatic variant prioritization, by defining performant data architecture that harmonizes and integrates the large amount of experimental and annotation data available through Bioconductor.

Genomics holds promise for improving classification and prognostication of malignancies, yet oncology practice continues to rely heavily on immunohistochemistry (IHC) as a fundamental tool due to its practicality and ability to provide protein-level and subcellular localization information. The goal of this proposal is to create an open-source software resource for the quantitative analysis of IHC stained tissues and effective integration of IHC, genomic, and clinical features for cancer classification and prognostication.

7R21CA231904-02,R21CA231904,9949194,2019,An Ontology-driven Faceted Query Engine for the Kentucky Cancer Registry,"ABSTRACT A key barrier in cancer research is the traditional data access workflow that requires a hypothesis prior to accessing patient data, rather than a workflow that begins with data exploration while protecting privacy. Existing query engines allow researchers to explore clinical data, build queries, and execute queries without the need for the user to understand how the data is stored. However, the interfaces of such query engines have not achieved usability approaching the levels of those for consumer websites due in critical part to the lack of faceted capabilities. Faceted systems for querying clinical data is currently unavailable due to the complexity of data and the mismatch between the ontologies used for organizing and annotating clinical data (such as NCI Thesaurus), and the desired facet structures and properties. We propose to overcome these challenges by developing OncoSphere, a query engine using the NCI Thesaurus as a nested facet system (NFS) to provide web-based exploration of the Kentucky Cancer Registry data using 3 Specific Aims. In Aim 1 we will develop an approach to transform and implement NCI Thesaurus into an NFS to enable OncoSphere’s interface features. In Aim 2 we will develop methods to perform quality auditing on the hierarchical structure of the NCI Thesaurus to enhance its quality in supporting faceted query for OncoSphere. In Aim 3 we will perform evaluation on OncoSphere’s query expressiveness, query performance and conduct preliminary usability assessment. OncoSphere will break new ground in web-based tools and capitalize on available data resources to accelerate cancer research. We expect OncoSphere and its future versions to become an invaluable resource for the cancer research community.

1R01CA204136-01A1,R01CA204136,9239352,2017,Credentialing murine models for glioblastoma preclinical drug development,"ABSTRACT Precision medicine promises to revolutionize oncology by targeting drugs to specific mutations. However, targeted drugs have failed to produce durable clinical responses when used as single agents in glioblastoma (GBM), the most common and deadly primary brain tumor. Genetically engineered mouse (GEM) models are essential for functional validation of such mutations, but technical limitations have prevented their widespread use in preclinical cancer drug development. The Miller Lab has developed non- germline GEM (nGEM) models. The Berens Lab has performed comprehensive genomic and chemovulnerability profiling in a genetically diverse and faithful panel of patient-derived human xenograft (PDX) models. The Johnson Lab has developed a novel chemical proteomics method, multiplex inhibitor beads coupled with mass spectrometry (MIB-MS), to assess the activation state of the cellular kinome en masse and has shown that dynamic kinome reprogramming contributes to targeted drug resistance. In this Multi-PI project, we will combine our expertise to address the following Aims: (1) To credential PDX models against human GBM by kinome proteomics; (2) To develop genetically-matched nGEM models from distinct cells of origin; and (3) To credential PDX and nGEM models by dynamic kinome profiling. We will develop a genetically diverse panel of nGEM models with defined driver mutations and cellular origins that will be useful adjunct to PDX for preclinical drug development. We will then credential both PDX and nGEM models against resected GBM specimens using cross-species genome, transcriptome, and kinome, and drug response profiling. Models will be genomically matched to their human counterparts and used to develop rational combination therapies that combat single agent resistance mechanisms in genomically- defined tumor subtypes.

Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is an effective first line therapy for locally advanced or metastatic disease. Unfortunately, once PCa recurs, the eventual development of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) remains an incurable disease and more effective therapies are needed. Currently, a limited number of cancer cell lines (LnCAP, PC3, DU-145, etc.) are available for research and many genetic mutations present in prostate cancer (e.g., SPOP mutation, FOXA1 mutation, TMPRSS2-ERG fusion, CHD1 loss) are not represented in such cells. New patient-derived cancer models are needed. However, patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models are successful at less than 2-5% efficiency with aggressive, high-grade metastatic tumors and organoid cultures only have an efficiency of 20%. However, our preliminary data demonstrate that conditional reprogramming (CR) has nearly a 100% success rate for establishing long-term cultures from either surgical prostate specimens or CT-guided biopsies. In this application, we propose the following specific aims to validate the potential of CR for translational use in human CRPC. We will first establish CR cultures from biopsies of 30 patients with CRPC and will characterize these culture genetically and phenotypically. Second, we compare the patients' drug response to those of corresponding tumor CR cells and their derivative CR- derived xenografts (CDXs). Lastly, we will use CR cultures in an unbiased high-throughput screen to identify new potential therapies for CRPC in collaboration with Dr. Craig Thomas at National Center for Advanced Translational Sciences (NCATS).

However, targeted drugs have failed to produce durable clinical responses when used as single agents in glioblastoma (GBM), the most common and deadly primary brain tumor. Genetically engineered mouse (GEM) models are essential for functional validation of such mutations, but technical limitations have prevented their widespread use in preclinical cancer drug development. The Miller Lab has developed non- germline GEM (nGEM) models. The Berens Lab has performed comprehensive genomic and chemovulnerability profiling in a genetically diverse and faithful panel of patient-derived human xenograft (PDX) models. The Johnson Lab has developed a novel chemical proteomics method, multiplex inhibitor beads coupled with mass spectrometry (MIB-MS), to assess the activation state of the cellular kinome en masse and has shown that dynamic kinome reprogramming contributes to targeted drug resistance. In this Multi-PI project, we will combine our expertise to address the following Aims: (1) To credential PDX models against human GBM by kinome proteomics; (2) To develop genetically-matched nGEM models from distinct cells of origin; and (3) To credential PDX and nGEM models by dynamic kinome profiling. We will develop a genetically diverse panel of nGEM models with defined driver mutations and cellular origins that will be useful adjunct to PDX for preclinical drug development. We will then credential both PDX and nGEM models against resected GBM specimens using cross-species genome, transcriptome, and kinome, and drug response profiling.

PEP-CTN clinical trials will incorporate correlative genomics, biology, pharmacology, and imaging studies to further the understanding of the disposition and action of new agents introduced into the treatment of children with cancer. Annually, the PEP-CTN will enroll approximately 120 children and adolescents with cancer onto clinical trials of novel anticancer agents at the 21 core premier pediatric oncology sites throughout the country. The network institutions are selected through a peer review process, and serve as a national and international model for new agent development in pediatric oncology. The PEP- CTN will leverage the database infrastructure and resources of the parent Children's Oncology Group while maintaining its own administrative and operational infrastructure to ensure rapid development, implementation, and reporting of specialized and complex early phase clinical trials. The PEP-CTN has expertise and resources for the conduct of translational biology, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacogenetic studies, and utilizes state-of-the-art informatics systems to facilitate the transfer of response and correlative imaging studies for central review and analyses. The PEP-CTN's primary specific aims are: 1) To safely and efficiently introduce novel anticancer agents into the pediatric setting through the conduct of early phase clinical trials; 2) To expeditiously obtain preliminary efficacy signals through use of phase 2 expansion cohorts and pilot studies in order to inform tumor specific trials that will be conducted across COG sites; 3) To perform genomic analyses, including single gene studies or gene panels, to identify appropriate patients for early phase studies of targeted agents; 4) To identify associations of tumor characteristics with response to new agents using genomic analyses such as whole exome sequencing and RNA sequencing; 5) To incorporate pharmacologic and biologic endpoints, including circulating tumor DNA, other translational laboratory studies, and imaging modalities, into early phase studies, in order to enhance our understanding of the new agents and their effect on tumors..

1U01CA199288-01,U01CA199288,8968148,2015,In Vivo Drug Testing of Pediatric CNS Tumors Using Patient Derived Orthotopic Xenograft Models,"﻿ DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is prepared in response to the funding opportunity: Pediatric Preclinical Testing Consortium Research Programs (U01), RFA-CA-14-018. Specifically, we propose for Type B: Research Program for tumors of central nervous system (CNS) in vivo testing. Brain tumors are the leading cause of cancer-related death in children. One of the challenges in clinical drug development is how to effectively prioritize drug candidates to ensure clinical success in cancer patients. As pediatric drug candidates are much more numerous than the small number of patients, it is essential to perform comprehensive pre-clinical testing to identify the investigational agents that are most likely to be effective in the clinic. However, such effort has been blocked for many years due to the lack of clinically relevant and molecularly accurate model systems. Fortunately, we have established a large panel (>70) of patient derived orthotopic xenograft (PDOX) models of pediatric brain tumors through direct injection of patient tumor specimens into the brains of SCID mice. These PDOX models are shown to have replicated the histopathological features, invasive phenotypes and major genetic abnormalities (gene expression, DNA copy number and gene mutations) of the original primary tumors even during serial sub-transplantations in vivo in mouse brains. The xenograft tumor cells can also be cryopreserved for sustained and on-demand supply of tumorigenic PDOX cells. This capacity combined with our optimized surgical procedure, with which we can implant up to 260 mice per day, makes it possible for us to test multiple (e.g., 6-10) drugs per year for every tumor type. Our objective is therefore to make use of this unique panel of PDOX models to examine therapeutic efficacy of new agents and to analyze mechanisms of action and therapy resistance in high grade glioma, medulloblastoma and ependymoma. Our hypothesis is that these patient-specific PDOX tumors will respond to anti-cancer therapies similarly to the corresponding human primary tumors, and the effective agents identified through this system would have better chances of clinical success. To test this hypothesis, we will perform a series of in vitro and in vivo assays to achieve the following aims: 1) to identify genetically accurate candidate PDOX models that bear the therapeutic target(s) of new investigational drugs through data mining of our mouse model molecular characterization databases; 2) to select the most responsive models through functional in vitro screening to determine time- and dose- responses; 3) to demonstrate therapeutic efficacy of new investigational drugs in multiple target-bearing PDOX models; and 4) to perform detailed analysis of cellular and molecular mechanisms of cell killing as well as the causes of therapy resistance both in vitro and in vivo. Our novel panel of PDOX mouse models represents a broad spectrum of genetic abnormalities of pediatric CNS tumors. All the assays are well established and routinely performed in our laboratory; we are uniquely positioned to accomplish the proposed drug studies in vivo.

Our lab’s long- term mission is to identify novel molecular targets in osteosarcoma via comprehensive genomic and proteomic profiling of patient-derived cell lines and xenografts as well as human tumors with the ultimate goal of identifying and/or developing and testing therapeutics against these targets. To achieve this goal, we have a) built a robust profiling platform to identify novel targets; b) expanded our repertoire of osteosarcoma patient derived xenograft (PDX) models to reflect disease heterogeneity; and c) conducted high-throughput in vivo testing of 8-10 new agents each year both as part of Pediatric Preclinical Testing Consortium (PPTC) as well as independent of it. All of these efforts form the basis of our current research proposal and place us strongly poised to successfully achieve our goals. Our overall objective is to efficiently evaluate the efficacy of new agents with high potential to have activity in osteosarcoma based on target data from our genomic and proteomic profiling both as single agents and in rational combinations, with the vision of moving effective agents into clinical trials through the Children’s Oncology Group. We have three specific aims- 1) to select and test agents in vivo against surface targets identified by comprehensive proteomic profiling of osteosarcoma xenografts and patient tumors; 2) to select and test agents in vivo against targets identified by comprehensive genomic profiling of osteosarcoma xenografts and patient tumors; and 3) to perform testing of rationally combined agents based on target, toxicity and efficacy data of single agents. Agents from the PPTC pipeline will be selected based on either the proteomic target or genomic alteration being present in at least a subset of available osteosarcoma PDX models. The agent will be tested in selected cohorts of low/ high expressing protein target or present/ absent genomic alteration. In cases with multiple models with target expression, 3-5 mice per model will be used and in cases with few models available, 8-10 mice per model will be used for control and experiment groups with an overall n per arm per experiment of approximately 30 mice. Standard PPTC procedures will be used for tumor implantation and treatment. Tumor dimensions will be measured twice a week and response quantified as per standard PPTC definitions of complete response, maintained complete response, partial response, stable disease and progressive disease. For combination studies, three potential types of combinations will be considered based on efficacy and toxicity data- a) two surface protein targeted agents such as two antibody-drug conjugates; 2) two molecularly targeted agents and 3) a surface protein targeted agent and a molecularly targeted agent.

They not only represent different clinical stage (i.e., at diagnosis, relapse and terminal/autopsy) but also replicate a broad spectrum of the newly identified molecular subtypes of nearly all types of pediatric brain tumors.

A panel of well characterized osteosarcoma patient derived xenografts with genetic changes recapitulating the disease, have been tested by our laboratory as part of the Pediatric Preclinical Testing Program. These efforts thus far have been highly successful in identifying several drugs which are currently being or about to be tested in osteosarcoma clinical trials conducted by the Children's Oncology Group - specifically eribulin and glembatumumab vedotin. Numerous additional osteosarcoma patient derived xenograft models have been developed potentially permitting expansion of the panel of tumors assessed. In this proposal exploration of using a more efficient approach to screen for drug activity in the established models may permit utilization of a broader panel of osteosarcoma patient derived xenografts. In this proposal eltrombopag will be explored for activity in the treatment of osteosarcoma based on promising in vitro data.

Our lab’s long- term mission is to identify novel molecular targets in osteosarcoma via comprehensive genomic and proteomic profiling of patient-derived cell lines and xenografts as well as human tumors with the ultimate goal of identifying and/or developing and testing therapeutics against these targets. To achieve this goal, we have a) built a robust profiling platform to identify novel targets; b) expanded our repertoire of osteosarcoma patient derived xenograft (PDX) models to reflect disease heterogeneity; and c) conducted high-throughput in vivo testing of 8-10 new agents each year both as part of Pediatric Preclinical Testing Consortium (PPTC) as well as independent of it. All of these efforts form the basis of our current research proposal and place us strongly poised to successfully achieve our goals. Our overall objective is to efficiently evaluate the efficacy of new agents with high potential to have activity in osteosarcoma based on target data from our genomic and proteomic profiling both as single agents and in rational combinations, with the vision of moving effective agents into clinical trials through the Children’s Oncology Group. We have three specific aims- 1) to select and test agents in vivo against surface targets identified by comprehensive proteomic profiling of osteosarcoma xenografts and patient tumors; 2) to select and test agents in vivo against targets identified by comprehensive genomic profiling of osteosarcoma xenografts and patient tumors; and 3) to perform testing of rationally combined agents based on target, toxicity and efficacy data of single agents. Agents from the PPTC pipeline will be selected based on either the proteomic target or genomic alteration being present in at least a subset of available osteosarcoma PDX models. The agent will be tested in selected cohorts of low/ high expressing protein target or present/ absent genomic alteration. In cases with multiple models with target expression, 3-5 mice per model will be used and in cases with few models available, 8-10 mice per model will be used for control and experiment groups with an overall n per arm per experiment of approximately 30 mice. Standard PPTC procedures will be used for tumor implantation and treatment. Tumor dimensions will be measured twice a week and response quantified as per standard PPTC definitions of complete response, maintained complete response, partial response, stable disease and progressive disease. For combination studies, three potential types of combinations will be considered based on efficacy and toxicity data- a) two surface protein targeted agents such as two antibody-drug conjugates; 2) two molecularly targeted agents and 3) a surface protein targeted agent and a molecularly targeted agent.

Specifically, we propose for Type B: Research Program for tumors of central nervous system (CNS) in vivo testing. Brain tumors are the leading cause of cancer-related death in children. One of the challenges in clinical drug development is how to effectively prioritize drug candidates to ensure clinical success in cancer patients. As pediatric drug candidates are much more numerous than the small number of patients, it is essential to perform comprehensive pre-clinical testing to identify the investigational agents that are most likely to be effective in the clinic. However, such effort has been blocked for many years due to the lack of clinically relevant and molecularly accurate model systems. Fortunately, we have established a large panel (>70) of patient derived orthotopic xenograft (PDOX) models of pediatric brain tumors through direct injection of patient tumor specimens into the brains of SCID mice. These PDOX models are shown to have replicated the histopathological features, invasive phenotypes and major genetic abnormalities (gene expression, DNA copy number and gene mutations) of the original primary tumors even during serial sub-transplantations in vivo in mouse brains. The xenograft tumor cells can also be cryopreserved for sustained and on-demand supply of tumorigenic PDOX cells. This capacity combined with our optimized surgical procedure, with which we can implant up to 260 mice per day, makes it possible for us to test multiple (e.g., 6-10) drugs per year for every tumor type. Our objective is therefore to make use of this unique panel of PDOX models to examine therapeutic efficacy of new agents and to analyze mechanisms of action and therapy resistance in high grade glioma, medulloblastoma and ependymoma. Our hypothesis is that these patient-specific PDOX tumors will respond to anti-cancer therapies similarly to the corresponding human primary tumors, and the effective agents identified through this system would have better chances of clinical success. To test this hypothesis, we will perform a series of in vitro and in vivo assays to achieve the following aims: 1) to identify genetically accurate candidate PDOX models that bear the therapeutic target(s) of new investigational drugs through data mining of our mouse model molecular characterization databases; 2) to select the most responsive models through functional in vitro screening to determine time- and dose- responses; 3) to demonstrate therapeutic efficacy of new investigational drugs in multiple target-bearing PDOX models; and 4) to perform detailed analysis of cellular and molecular mechanisms of cell killing as well as the causes of therapy resistance both in vitro and in vivo. Our novel panel of PDOX mouse models represents a broad spectrum of genetic abnormalities of pediatric CNS tumors.

Specifically, we propose to continue the in vivo testing program for central nervous system (CNS) tumors using our panel of patient derived orthotopic xenograft (PDOX) models. Brain tumor is the leading cause of cancer-related death in children. One of the challenges in clinical drug development is how to effectively prioritize drug candidates to ensure clinical success in cancer patients. However, efforts in identifying new anti-cancer agents for that are most likely to be effective in the clinic have been blocked for many years due to the lack of clinically relevant and molecularly accurate model system. Fortunately, we have established a panel of 150 PDOX models of pediatric brain tumors through direct injection of patient tumor specimens into the brains of SCID mice. These PDOX models are shown to have replicated the histopathology and major genetic abnormalities of the original patient tumors even during serial sub-transplantations in vivo in mouse brains. They not only represent different clinical stage (i.e., at diagnosis, relapse and terminal/autopsy) but also replicate a broad spectrum of the newly identified molecular subtypes of nearly all types of pediatric brain tumors. The xenograft tumor cells can also be cryopreserved for sustained and on-demand supply of tumorigenic PDOX cells. This capacity combined with our optimized surgical procedure, with which we can implant up to 260 mice per day, makes it possible for us to test multiple (e.g., 6-10) drugs per year for every tumor type. Our objective is therefore to make use of this unique panel of PDOX models to examine therapeutic efficacy of new agents and to analyze mechanisms of action and therapy resistance in high grade glioma, medulloblastoma, ependymoma, DIPG and ATRT. Our hypothesis is that these patient-specific PDOX tumors will respond to anti-cancer therapies similarly to the corresponding human primary tumors, and the effective agents identified through this system would have better chances of clinical success. To test this hypothesis, we will perform a series of in vitro and in vivo assays to achieve the following aims: 1) to identify genetically accurate candidate PDOX models that bear the therapeutic target(s) of new investigational drugs through data mining of our mouse model molecular characterization databases; 2) to select the most responsive models through functional in vitro screening to determine time- and dose-responses; 3) to demonstrate therapeutic efficacy of new investigational drugs in multiple target-bearing PDOX models; and 4) to perform detailed analysis of cellular and molecular mechanisms of cell killing as well as the causes of therapy resistance both in vitro and in vivo.

1U01CA256801-01,U01CA256801,10126626,2021,Optimizing Dual-Targeted and Dual-Armored CAR T Cells for Small Cell Lung Cancer,"ABSTRACT A patient's own T cells can be modified using gene therapy technology to express receptors, termed chimeric antigen receptors or CARs, which allow these immune T cells to recognize proteins on the tumor cell surface, and in turn allow these CAR modified T cells to recognize and kill the patient's own tumor cells. This approach has been successful in some hematological malignancies, however, it has not been successful to date in solid tumors including small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Two mechanisms by which SCLC may evade T cell-mediated killing are loss of expression of antigens, and suppression of T cell function in the tumor microenvironment. In this proposal, we will attempt to overcome these barriers by designing CAR T cells that target two SCLC antigens simultaneously, and that produce multiple factors (“armors”) that enhance T cell activity in solid tumors. We hypothesize that these dual-armored, dual targeted (DADT) CAR T cells will be more effective against SCLC than previous T cell-mediated and immune therapies. We have previously shown that CAR T cells targeted to either the antigen GD3 or to the antigen DLL3, both of which are expressed on the majority of small cell lung cancers, are capable of killing SCLC cells in preclinical systems. Additionally, we have developed multiple armored CAR T cells that secrete factors such as IL-18, or an antibody-derived single-chain variable fragment (scFv) that blocks the immune checkpoint receptor PD-1, or an scFv blocking the phagocytosis-inhibitory signal CD47 on tumor cells. All of these armors enhance CAR T cell activity in our in vivo model systems through different mechanisms. In Aim 1 of this proposal, we will generate CAR T cells targeting DLL3 and GD3 simultaneously, to overcome antigen heterogeneity and antigen loss in tumors as a means of escape from T cell-mediated killing. Simultaneously, in Aim 2, we will test pairs of armors to identify the pair that is the most effective at enhancing the activity of single antigen-targeted CAR T cells against SCLC in vivo in immunocompetent systems. We then analyze the immune cells in the SCLC tumor microenvironment following CAR T cell treatment to assess changes mediated by the armored CAR T cells. Ultimately, in Aim 3, we will combine these approaches to generate CAR T cells that recognize GD3 and DLL3 and produce multiple armors. These DADT CAR T cells for SCLC may be suitable for further preclinical testing in preparation for clinical trials beyond the scope of this proposal, representing a novel therapeutic approach to SCLC. Given our robust track record in CAR T cell clinical translation, we fully anticipate having new CAR T cells suitable for clinical trials at the conclusion of funding. Additionally, these novel CAR T cells may be used as tools to explore the interactions between T cells and the SCLC microenvironment.

1U54CA274375-01,U54CA274375,10519080,2022,The stromal microenvironment as a co-organizer of bladder carcinogenesis  and progression,"OVERALL PROJECT SUMMARY Bladder cancer (BC) is the second most common urologic malignancy affecting 573,278 people worldwide in 2020. Pathologically, BC is diagnosed as non-muscle-invasive (NMI) and muscle-invasive (MI) disease. Here we define early bladder lesions as NMIBC. Major clinical gaps in NMIBC include i) lack of mechanistic insights defining NMIBC progression, and ii) lack of platform for risk stratification of NMIBC that recur but never progress (“non-progressors”), from those that progresses into MIBC (“progressors”) and consequently demonstrate poor prognosis. The goal of our Center is to tackle this clinical issue by deciphering the underlying mechanisms restraining or promoting the progression of early lesions (Project 1 & 2), and to leverage this novel biology as candidate biomarkers to risk-stratify aggressive NMIBC (Project 3). This proposal seeks to shift the current research paradigm in the field of NMIBC, by proposing a conceptually innovative tug-of-war between a tumor- restraining (Project 1) and a tumor-promoting mechanism (Project 2) in determining the outcome of early bladder lesions/NMIBC in becoming “progressors” or “non-progressors” (Project 3). Clinically, why “non-progressors” often recur but seldom progress, and what are the driving forces advancing “progressors” into MIBC with poor survival remain fundamental questions in field. Our tug-of-war hypothesis with two opposing forces is conceptually different to most other studies, which primarily focus on one side of the coin. Further, the integration of knowledge from Project 1 and 2 as a unified spatial proteomics and transcriptomics map by the Shared Resource Core will reveal spatial and temporal relationships between distinct fibroblast populations with opposing functions, their physical interactions with tumor and immune cell clusters, as well as their relationship to the biomarkers from Project 3. Benchmark of success: The knowledge gained here will shift clinical practice paradigm, by informing future NIMBC management through 1) the development of novel urinary profiling strategies that could risk stratify aggressive NMIBC (Project 1-3); 2) the identification of targets for future precision intervention, either by enhancing/sustaining the tumor-restraining mechanisms (Project 1) and/or inhibiting the tumor-promoting mechanisms (Project 2).

7U54CA274375-02,U54CA274375,10831757,2023,The stromal microenvironment as a co-organizer of bladder carcinogenesis  and progression,"OVERALL PROJECT SUMMARY Bladder cancer (BC) is the second most common urologic malignancy affecting 573,278 people worldwide in 2020. Pathologically, BC is diagnosed as non-muscle-invasive (NMI) and muscle-invasive (MI) disease. Here we define early bladder lesions as NMIBC. Major clinical gaps in NMIBC include i) lack of mechanistic insights defining NMIBC progression, and ii) lack of platform for risk stratification of NMIBC that recur but never progress (“non-progressors”), from those that progresses into MIBC (“progressors”) and consequently demonstrate poor prognosis. The goal of our Center is to tackle this clinical issue by deciphering the underlying mechanisms restraining or promoting the progression of early lesions (Project 1 & 2), and to leverage this novel biology as candidate biomarkers to risk-stratify aggressive NMIBC (Project 3). This proposal seeks to shift the current research paradigm in the field of NMIBC, by proposing a conceptually innovative tug-of-war between a tumor- restraining (Project 1) and a tumor-promoting mechanism (Project 2) in determining the outcome of early bladder lesions/NMIBC in becoming “progressors” or “non-progressors” (Project 3). Clinically, why “non-progressors” often recur but seldom progress, and what are the driving forces advancing “progressors” into MIBC with poor survival remain fundamental questions in field. Our tug-of-war hypothesis with two opposing forces is conceptually different to most other studies, which primarily focus on one side of the coin. Further, the integration of knowledge from Project 1 and 2 as a unified spatial proteomics and transcriptomics map by the Shared Resource Core will reveal spatial and temporal relationships between distinct fibroblast populations with opposing functions, their physical interactions with tumor and immune cell clusters, as well as their relationship to the biomarkers from Project 3. Benchmark of success: The knowledge gained here will shift clinical practice paradigm, by informing future NIMBC management through 1) the development of novel urinary profiling strategies that could risk stratify aggressive NMIBC (Project 1-3); 2) the identification of targets for future precision intervention, either by enhancing/sustaining the tumor-restraining mechanisms (Project 1) and/or inhibiting the tumor-promoting mechanisms (Project 2). The overall success of our program is further ensured by an extraordinary multi-investigator team that integrates three “organ-specific” bladder cancer investigators within Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. All have active R01s and individual NCI-funding track record in performing basic science research, translational bladder cancer research, or leading multi-center clinical trials on the discovery and validation of biomarkers. Finally, they propose to collect valuable retrospective and prospective NMIBC cohorts, which are essential to address the clinical questions posed within this proposal and will become available to the research community as a shared resource to advance the field.",Address;Affect;Antitumor Response;B-Lymphocytes;Basic Science;Benchmarking;Bioinformatics;Biological;Biological Markers;Biology;Bladder;Cancer Biology;Cancer Patient;Carcinogens;Cell Communication;Cells;Clinical;Coin;Communication;Communities;Data;Development;Diagnosis;Disease;Ensure;Fibroblasts;Fingerprint;Funding;Future;Genes;Genomics;Goals;Human;Immune;Immunoassay;Individual;Knowledge;Lesion;Lymphoid Tissue;Malignant Neoplasms;Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder;Maps;Mediating;Medical center;Modeling;Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial;Muscle;Organ;Outcome;Paracrine Communication;Pathologic;Pattern;Persons;Pilot Projects;Population;Primary Lesion;Prognosis;Property;Protein Secretion;Proteins;Proteomics;Recurrence;Recurrent Malignant Neoplasm;Reporting;Research;Research Personnel;Resource Sharing;Role;Sampling;Side;T-Lymphocyte;Tumor Promotion;Urine;Urothelial Cell;Validation;War;Yin;anticancer research;biomarker development;biomarker validation;cancer recurrence;cancer type;candidate marker;carcinogenesis;cell type;clinical practice;cohort;driving force;fibroblast-activating factor;functional genomics;induced pluripotent stem cell;innovation;insight;knowledge integration;lymphotoxin beta receptor;mouse model;multidisciplinary;neoplastic cell;non-muscle invasive bladder cancer;novel;personalized intervention;progenitor;programs;prospective;recombinase;recruit;restraint;risk stratification;single cell technology;success;tertiary lymphoid organ;transcriptomics;translational oncology;tumor;tumor growth;tumor progression;understudied cancer;urinary;urologic,Keith Syson Chan; Dan Theodorescu,Mihoko Kai,1657891,1657891,2023-09-21T12:09:00Z,2022-09-22T12:09:00Z,2027-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-21-054,nofo_CA21-054,METHODIST HOSPITAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE,houston,TX,UNITED STATES,tbel,org_city,False

However, the late effects of cancer treatment, including permanent organ and tissue damage, hormonal and reproductive dysfunction and second cancers, are of special concern, with more than 40% of the estimated 360,000 survivors of childhood cancer experiencing a significant health-related quality of life complication from childhood cancer and its treatment. In addition, progress for a number of childhood cancers remains limited with approximately 50% of children with acute myelogenous leukemia, 50% of children with high-risk neuroblastoma, and more than 90% of children with brainstem glioma, still succumbing to their disease. The Children’s Oncology Group (COG), the world’s largest organization devoted exclusively to childhood and adolescent cancer research, and its multidisciplinary research teams comprised of more than 9,000 members, conducts research at more than 220 leading children’s hospitals, universities, and cancer centers. This proposal is for the COG NCI Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP) Research Base to continue its collaborative research work for our 26 community and 16 minority/underserved NCORP sites. With COG’s significant scientific, statistical, data management and information technology infrastructure, we seek to conduct pediatric clinical trials to define optimal treatments, and conduct laboratory research that will translate into more effective treatments with reduced side effects. The COG directly addresses the NCORP goals of providing access to state-of-the-art cancer treatment at community sites while conducting research in cancer control, including post-treatment surveillance/survivorship, and cancer care delivery.

1U24CA220325-01A1,U24CA220325,9507097,2018,VU PREDICT,"Project Summary This application proposes a new U24 Oncology Co-Clinical Imaging Resource entitled VU-PREDICT (Vanderbilt University-PET imaging Resource to Enhance Delivery of Individualized Cancer Therapeutics). Precision cancer medicine, which seeks to exploit unique cellular, molecular and genetic characteristics of individual tumors to optimize treatment, remains a critically unmet need. Despite advances in biomarker technologies that yield high-quality cellular and genomic data, critical gaps remain to consistently match patients with cancer and ideal therapies. While `predictive' genomic assays based on RNA and DNA are now commonplace, current methods largely ignore tumor phenotypes differentiable by quantitative imaging. The overarching vision for VU-PREDICT is a suite of quantitative imaging tools that facilitate the discovery of novel, predictive imaging-derived gene expression signatures; such signatures can be deployed by the greater oncology community to improve the personalization of cancer treatment. The linchpin of VU-PREDICT will be positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. The sensitive and quantitative nature of PET, coupled with the ability to produce biologically active PET tracers, renders PET uniquely capable of both detecting tumors and profiling their specific features. Complementary to genomic approaches, PET imaging provides a quantitative, functional measure of tumor phenotype, and when coupled biopsy approaches, can provide a significantly greater breadth of biological characterization. VU-PREDICT centers on a parallel co-clinical trial of patients with advanced colorectal cancer (CRC) and human-in-mouse PDX (patient-derived xenograft) models. CRC is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs; cetuximab, panitumumab) are approved for treatment of advanced wild-type (WT) RAS CRC. However, durable responses to anti-EGFR mAbs occur in only 12–17% of patients. VU-PREDICT will capitalize upon a Phase I/II clinical trial opening at Vanderbilt combining a glutaminase (GLS1) inhibitor (CB-839, Calithera), EGFR mAb therapy (panitumumab) and irinotecan in patients with advanced and refractory WT RAS CRC. It is anticipated that combining CB-839 with EGFR mAb therapy will resensitize refractory CRC patients with Gln- avid tumors to EGFR blockade. VU-PREDICT will allow our development of quantitative PET imaging measures within this trial and in related preclinical studies that may identify patients likely to respond to combined GLS1/EGFR inhibition. We have four Specific Aims: (1) Optimize quantitative preclinical PET imaging protocols for Gln metabolism; Implement quantitative 18F-FSPG PET (2), 11C-Acetate PET (3), and dual-tracer 11C-Acetate/18F-FSPG PET (4) to discover predictive, imaging-derived gene expression signatures.",Acetates;Affect;Algorithms;Biological;Biological Assay;Biological Factors;Biological Markers;Biological Process;Biopsy;Cancer Etiology;Cancer Model;Cancer Patient;Cessation of life;Cetuximab;Characteristics;Chronobiology;Circadian Rhythms;Clinical;Clinical Trials;Colorectal Cancer;Community Clinical Oncology Program;Coupled;DNA;Data;Data Analyses;Development;Diet;Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor;Gene Expression Profile;Genomic approach;Glutaminase;Glutamine;Histologic;Human;Image;Imaging Device;Individual;Knowledge;Lead;Ligands;Location;MAP Kinase Gene;Malignant Neoplasms;Measures;Mediating;Metabolism;Methods;Molecular;Molecular Genetics;Monoclonal Antibodies;Monoclonal Antibody Therapy;Mus;Nature;Outcome;Patients;Phase;Phenotype;Positron-Emission Tomography;Protocols documentation;RNA;Radiochemistry;Receptor Inhibition;Refractory;Regimen;Reproducibility;Research;Resistance;Resources;Standardization;TP53 gene;Technology;Therapeutic;Tracer;Universities;Validation;Vision;Xenograft Model;Xenograft procedure;attenuation;base;clinical imaging;colon cancer patients;experience;genomic data;genomic predictors;imaging modality;improved;inhibitor/antagonist;irinotecan;mouse model;neutralizing monoclonal antibodies;novel;oncology;panitumumab;personalized cancer therapy;pre-clinical;precision oncology;preclinical study;predicting response;quantitative imaging;reconstruction;response;subcutaneous;targeted treatment;tool;treatment optimization;tumor,Jordan D Berlin; Henry Charles Manning,Huiming Zhang,664613,664613,2018-09-14T12:09:00Z,2018-09-14T12:09:00Z,2023-08-31T12:08:00Z,PAR-16-385,nofo_PAR-16-385,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,NASHVILLE,tn,UNITED STATES,cirp,org_state,True

Precision cancer medicine, which seeks to exploit unique cellular, molecular and genetic characteristics of individual tumors to optimize treatment, remains a critically unmet need. Despite advances in biomarker technologies that yield high-quality cellular and genomic data, critical gaps remain to consistently match patients with cancer and ideal therapies. While `predictive' genomic assays based on RNA and DNA are now commonplace, current methods largely ignore tumor phenotypes differentiable by quantitative imaging. The overarching vision for VU-PREDICT is a suite of quantitative imaging tools that facilitate the discovery of novel, predictive imaging-derived gene expression signatures; such signatures can be deployed by the greater oncology community to improve the personalization of cancer treatment. The linchpin of VU-PREDICT will be positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. The sensitive and quantitative nature of PET, coupled with the ability to produce biologically active PET tracers, renders PET uniquely capable of both detecting tumors and profiling their specific features. Complementary to genomic approaches, PET imaging provides a quantitative, functional measure of tumor phenotype, and when coupled biopsy approaches, can provide a significantly greater breadth of biological characterization. VU-PREDICT centers on a parallel co-clinical trial of patients with advanced colorectal cancer (CRC) and human-in-mouse PDX (patient-derived xenograft) models. CRC is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs; cetuximab, panitumumab) are approved for treatment of advanced wild-type (WT) RAS CRC. However, durable responses to anti-EGFR mAbs occur in only 12–17% of patients. VU-PREDICT will capitalize upon a Phase I/II clinical trial opening at Vanderbilt combining a glutaminase (GLS1) inhibitor (CB-839, Calithera), EGFR mAb therapy (panitumumab) and irinotecan in patients with advanced and refractory WT RAS CRC.

To evaluate their potential for translation, we will integrate these dynamic models with clinical trials that will evaluate whether these phenotypic changes can be targeted for therapy. We hypothesize that acquired resistance emerges from selection acting on phenotypes during tumor evolution, and that simultaneously measuring and modeling subclone genotypes and phenotypes will identify new, and testable, therapeutic targets. Selective pressures from therapy and the tumor microenvironment can propel subclones from every patient's tumor along an evolutionary trajectory that leads to resistance. Indeed, our data shows that both genetic and phenotypic diversity among tumor subclones evolves as cancer cells progress to a resistant state. However, it is not yet known the specific phenotypes that promote that resistant state, the interactions among them, and how they converge to common resistant phenotypes seen in late stage cancer. To address these and other questions, we will develop a new class of dynamical systems models of subclone evolution to characterize the changes and development of key cell states that arise during acquired chemo-resistance and metastasis using our unique patient cohorts. These mechanistic models will identify points of therapeutic vulnerability that we will test in clinical trials aimed at blocking evolution to a resistant state by targeting critical resistant phenotypes. Our Center is comprised of an Administrative, Education/Outreach, Translational, and Computational Cores, in addition to two complementary projects. The synergies are derived from: 1) the convergent parameterization of the evolutionary models drawn from deep longitudinal patient progression studies (Project 1) and broad multisite metastatic tumor analyses (Project 2), resulting in a robust model to identify resistant states for clinical targeting; and 2) an integrated computational and experimental framework and resources for dissecting tumor heterogeneity and evolution that will contribute to an improved capacity for personalized cancer therapy.

And we will provide state of the art tools for the analysis of patient samples and tumor genomic complexity. These studies move beyond prior research by integrating cell population dynamics and cellular phenotypes with cellular genotypes, and will deliver approaches and a knowledge base to block or reverse the transition to a resistant state for advanced stage cancer patients. interact in the progression toward chemoresistant breast and ovarian cancer",Address;Behavior;Biological Models;Biological Pharmacology;Biological Process;Breast;Cancer Patient;Cells;Clinical;Clinical Treatment;Clinical Trials;Clonal Evolution;Clonality;Collection;Communities;Community Outreach;Complex;DNA;Data;Development;Drug Targeting;Drug resistance;Education and Outreach;Educational Activities;Evolution;Faculty;Generations;Genetic;Genetic Transcription;Genomics;Genotype;Goals;Heterogeneity;Individual;Institutes;Knowledge;Malignant Neoplasms;Malignant neoplasm of ovary;Mathematics;Measures;Methodology;Modeling;Mutation;Neoplasm Metastasis;Oncogenic;Ovarian;Pathway interactions;Patients;Pharmacology;Pharmacology Study;Pharmacotherapy;Phenotype;Population Dynamics;Population Heterogeneity;Postdoctoral Fellow;Prevention program;Refractory;Regimen;Research;Research Infrastructure;Research Project Grants;Resistance;Resources;Sampling;Science;Scientific Advances and Accomplishments;Scientist;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;Site;Solid;Somatic Mutation;System;Systems Analysis;Systems Biology;Testing;Therapeutic;Translations;Variant;base;cancer cell;cohort;combat;computerized tools;data sharing;dynamic system;effective therapy;experimental study;improved;innovation;knowledge base;malignant breast neoplasm;member;multidisciplinary;neoplastic cell;next generation;novel drug combination;outreach program;personalized cancer therapy;predictive modeling;pressure;prevent;programs;student training;synergism;targeted treatment;therapeutic target;tool;transcriptomics;treatment response;treatment strategy;tumor;tumor heterogeneity;tumor microenvironment,Andrea Hope Bild,Shannon K Hughes,474644,474644,2017-05-09T12:05:00Z,2017-05-15T12:05:00Z,2017-09-30T12:09:00Z,RFA-CA-15-014,nofo_RFA-CA-15-014,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,SALT LAKE CITY,ut,UNITED STATES,csbc,org_state,True

To evaluate their potential for translation, we will integrate these dynamic models with clinical trials that will evaluate whether these phenotypic changes can be targeted for therapy. We hypothesize that acquired resistance emerges from selection acting on phenotypes during tumor evolution, and that simultaneously measuring and modeling subclone genotypes and phenotypes will identify new, and testable, therapeutic targets. Selective pressures from therapy and the tumor microenvironment can propel subclones from every patient's tumor along an evolutionary trajectory that leads to resistance. Indeed, our data shows that both genetic and phenotypic diversity among tumor subclones evolves as cancer cells progress to a resistant state. However, it is not yet known the specific phenotypes that promote that resistant state, the interactions among them, and how they converge to common resistant phenotypes seen in late stage cancer. To address these and other questions, we will develop a new class of dynamical systems models of subclone evolution to characterize the changes and development of key cell states that arise during acquired chemo-resistance and metastasis using our unique patient cohorts. These mechanistic models will identify points of therapeutic vulnerability that we will test in clinical trials aimed at blocking evolution to a resistant state by targeting critical resistant phenotypes. Our Center is comprised of an Administrative, Education/Outreach, Translational, and Computational Cores, in addition to two complementary projects. The synergies are derived from: 1) the convergent parameterization of the evolutionary models drawn from deep longitudinal patient progression studies (Project 1) and broad multisite metastatic tumor analyses (Project 2), resulting in a robust model to identify resistant states for clinical targeting; and 2) an integrated computational and experimental framework and resources for dissecting tumor heterogeneity and evolution that will contribute to an improved capacity for personalized cancer therapy.

These efforts have uncovered a staggering level of genome complexity in cancer. Although much is known about the function and clinical impact of recurrent aberrations in well-known cancer genes, less is known about which and how the more abundant, low-frequency mutations contribute to tumor progression. Effective translation of tumor genomic datasets into cancer therapeutics will require new experimental systems to inform the functional activity of targets in the relevant biological context encompassing inter- and intra-tumoral heterogeneity. To address these needs, we propose a CTD2 Center that will provide the research community high-throughput informatic and experimental approaches to characterize and validate pathogenic “driver” mutations and fusion genes as well as identify molecular markers that meaningfully predict responses or resistance to anticancer therapies. We will pursue the following Specific Aims: In Aim 1 we will implement an algorithmic framework for identifying driver mutations with high sensitivity and specificity. We will focus our algorithm development, training and testing efforts on predicting oncogenic, gain-of-function mutation drivers of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). These computational approaches will be amenable to the analysis of all cancer types. We will next engineer ~1,500 selected mutations and ~400 fusion genes into expression vectors along with cohorts of personalized, patient-defined coding mutations. In Aim 2 we will enter mutant alleles and fusion genes into GBM, PDAC and EOC context-specific, in vivo functional screens that take into account the importance of genetic context, tumor microenvironment and heterogeneity in the selection of single and combinatorial drivers of tumorigenesis. In Aim 3 we will determine the consequences of intra-tumoral heterogeneity on tumor sensitivity and resistance to therapeutic agents using DNA-barcoded, human patient-derived xenograft models that recapitulate the heterogeneity of cancer. We will determine the extent to which single targeted agents and their rational combinations alter tumor population dynamics. We will also leverage Aim 1 informatics and functional characterizations in Aim 2 and 4 to characterize “persistor” populations to identify aberrations associated with drug resistance. In Aim 4 we will use high-throughput functional proteomics, innovative protein- protein interaction assays and informer drug library screening studies to elucidate underlying mechanisms and therapeutic liabilities engendered by validated drivers.

2U01CA086400-16,U01CA086400,8996970,2016,Great Lakes New England Clinical Validation Center,"﻿ DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Continued support of the Great Lakes New England (GLNE) Clinical Validation Center (CVC) of the Early Detection Research Network (EDRN) via the U01 mechanism is requested. The GLNE CVC is a highly collaborative, multi-institutional consortium designed to develop, implement and analyze trials for the validation of biomarkers for the early detection of colorectal adenocarcinoma and other GI malignancies. Over the last 15 years, the GLNE has: 1. developed a high quality repository of samples collected from human subjects with colorectal, lower esophageal neoplasias, pancreatic neoplasms and controls; 2. collaborated with 9 biomarker developmental laboratories, 4 biomarker reference laboratories, the EDRN DMCC, and 9 industrial partners publishing 36 collaborative manuscripts; 3. Performed phase I validation trials of 26 biomarkers for the early detection of colorectal adenocarcinoma; 4. Initiated and recruited 5,154 participants to a Network-wide cross sectional validation trial of biomarkers for the early detection of colorectal cancer. The GLNE proposes to 1. Complete an ongoing prospective Phase 2 validation trial of vimentin methylation, serum galectin-3 ligand, BCAT1/IKZF1 methylation in plasma, fecal immunochemical tests (FIT), Exact Sciences stool DNA panel, or any future individual biomarker individually and as a panel for the early detection of colorectal neoplasia using colonoscopy as the gold standard; 2. To perform phase 1 validation trials (training and test set designs) of promising biomarkers discovered by EDRN Biomarker Validation Laboratories, external academic collaborating institutions, and collaborating EDRN industrial partners for the early detection of colorectal cancer, high grade colorectal dysplasia, and screen relevant colorectal neoplasms; 3. Assess the frequency of missed or occult colonic and upper gastrointestinal neoplasia in patients with initially normal colonoscopies and persistently positive stool DNA testing; and 4. Continue to expand and renew the archive of appropriately preserved stool, serum, plasma, urine, tissue and DNA biospecimens to be used by EDRN investigators for future validation and biomarker discovery research. These aims will be addressed by a multi-institutional consortium of university and community GI practices recruiting human subjects undergoing screening colonoscopy under a PRoBE compliant protocol.

In this fifth competitive application, the GLNE continues to test the overall hypothesis that a panel of circulating and stool based biomarkers will increase the adherence to colorectal screening and in doing so reduce mortality caused by colorectal cancers. Based on the rising incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) among adults age <50 in the US, and the low compliance and high mortality in underserved populations, increased emphasis is placed on these populations. The GLNE also proposes to continue its ongoing support of EDRN discovery priorities. We propose to address the following aims: (1) Primary Aim To expand and renew the archive of appropriately preserved stool, serum, plasma, urine, tissue and DNA biospecimens to be used by EDRN investigators for current and future validation and biomarker discovery research with expanded inclusion of subjects with early-onset CRC and underserved populations. This will allow assessment of the utility of individual stool-based, and serum-based biomarkers and biomarker panels for discriminating between individuals without neoplasia (subjects both at average and higher risk for developing colon cancer), and those with colon cancer or screen-relevant neoplasia (cancer plus advanced adenoma), and construction of panels of markers to discriminate between these groups. (2) To perform validation trials of promising biomarkers discovered by EDRN investigators, external collaborating institutions and collaborating EDRN industrial partners for the early detection of colorectal neoplasia. In this context we propose to (a) to clinically validate (via a methods comparison study) the performance of a point-of-care blood- based biomarker panel with the testing of serum/plasma samples obtained in clinics serving low-income and underserved communities and (b) to clinically validate an established 4-plex stool protein panel for early diagnosis of CRC.

1R21CA231904-01,R21CA231904,9604117,2018,An Ontology-driven Faceted Query Engine for the Kentucky Cancer Registry,"ABSTRACT A key barrier in cancer research is the traditional data access workflow that requires a hypothesis prior to accessing patient data, rather than a workflow that begins with data exploration while protecting privacy. Existing query engines allow researchers to explore clinical data, build queries, and execute queries without the need for the user to understand how the data is stored. However, the interfaces of such query engines have not achieved usability approaching the levels of those for consumer websites due in critical part to the lack of faceted capabilities. Faceted systems for querying clinical data is currently unavailable due to the complexity of data and the mismatch between the ontologies used for organizing and annotating clinical data (such as NCI Thesaurus), and the desired facet structures and properties. We propose to overcome these challenges by developing OncoSphere, a query engine using the NCI Thesaurus as a nested facet system (NFS) to provide web-based exploration of the Kentucky Cancer Registry data using 3 Specific Aims. In Aim 1 we will develop an approach to transform and implement NCI Thesaurus into an NFS to enable OncoSphere’s interface features. In Aim 2 we will develop methods to perform quality auditing on the hierarchical structure of the NCI Thesaurus to enhance its quality in supporting faceted query for OncoSphere. In Aim 3 we will perform evaluation on OncoSphere’s query expressiveness, query performance and conduct preliminary usability assessment. OncoSphere will break new ground in web-based tools and capitalize on available data resources to accelerate cancer research. We expect OncoSphere and its future versions to become an invaluable resource for the cancer research community. The long-term goal of this study is to create data exploration systems for NCI’s Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program and other related cancer data resources through data science innovations to transform user experience with a new generation of data interaction modalities.",Address;Adopted;Area;Biomedical Research;Characteristics;Clinical Data;Clinical Research;Clinical Trials;Communities;Computer software;Data;Data Science;Databases;Detection;Development;Ensure;Evaluation;Future;Generations;Goals;Kentucky;Knowledge;Lead;Malignant Neoplasms;Metadata;Methods;Modality;NCI Thesaurus;Online Systems;Ontology;Patients;Performance;Privacy;Property;Research Personnel;Resources;Role;SEER Program;Site;Software Tools;Structure;System;Terminology;Time;Translations;Trees;Work;anticancer research;data access;data integration;data management;data registry;data resource;design;experience;human data;improved;innovation;insight;lexical;neoplasm registry;neoplasm resource;novel;query optimization;sound;success;tool;usability;web app;web site;web-based tool,Licong Cui; Guo-Qiang Zhang,Donna Rivera,187621,187621,2018-06-06T12:06:00Z,2018-06-06T12:06:00Z,2019-02-03T12:02:00Z,PAR-15-334,nofo_PAR-15-334,UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY,LEXINGTON,ky,UNITED STATES,itcr,org_state,False
1U01CA220401-01A1,U01CA220401,9507539,2018,Informatics Tools for Quantitative Digital Pathology Profiling and Integrated Prognostic Modeling,"PROJECT SUMMARY Accurate biomarker-driven prognostic stratification, response prediction, and cohort enrichment are critical for realizing precision treatment strategies and population health management approaches that optimize quality of life and survival for cancer patients. Genomics holds promise for improving classification and prognostication of malignancies, yet oncology practice continues to rely heavily on immunohistochemistry (IHC) as a fundamental tool due to its practicality and ability to provide protein-level and subcellular localization information. The goal of this proposal is to create an open-source software resource for the quantitative analysis of IHC stained tissues and effective integration of IHC, genomic, and clinical features for cancer classification and prognostication. This proposal builds on our collective experience in computer-assisted analysis of microscopic images (including IHC images), development of machine-learning methods to address the challenges of classification and prognostication with heterogeneous and high-dimensional data, and leadership in collection and large-scale analysis of cancer outcomes involving collaboration with multiple medical centers. This effort for the first time will create tools to integrate quantitative IHC imaging, clinical, and genomic information that will in turn enable the research community to explore strategies for the classification of malignancies and prediction of outcomes.

Genomics holds promise for improving classification and prognostication of malignancies, yet oncology practice continues to rely heavily on immunohistochemistry (IHC) as a fundamental tool due to its practicality and ability to provide protein-level and subcellular localization information. The goal of this proposal is to create an open-source software resource for the quantitative analysis of IHC stained tissues and effective integration of IHC, genomic, and clinical features for cancer classification and prognostication. This proposal builds on our collective experience in computer-assisted analysis of microscopic images (including IHC images), development of machine-learning methods to address the challenges of classification and prognostication with heterogeneous and high-dimensional data, and leadership in collection and large-scale analysis of cancer outcomes involving collaboration with multiple medical centers. This effort for the first time will create tools to integrate quantitative IHC imaging, clinical, and genomic information that will in turn enable the research community to explore strategies for the classification of malignancies and prediction of outcomes. The proposed tools will be developed and extensively validated in close collaboration with clinical, genomic, and digital pathology data from the NCI-supported Lymphoma Epidemiology of Outcomes (LEO) cohort study.

7R21CA231904-02,R21CA231904,9949194,2019,An Ontology-driven Faceted Query Engine for the Kentucky Cancer Registry,"ABSTRACT A key barrier in cancer research is the traditional data access workflow that requires a hypothesis prior to accessing patient data, rather than a workflow that begins with data exploration while protecting privacy. Existing query engines allow researchers to explore clinical data, build queries, and execute queries without the need for the user to understand how the data is stored. However, the interfaces of such query engines have not achieved usability approaching the levels of those for consumer websites due in critical part to the lack of faceted capabilities. Faceted systems for querying clinical data is currently unavailable due to the complexity of data and the mismatch between the ontologies used for organizing and annotating clinical data (such as NCI Thesaurus), and the desired facet structures and properties. We propose to overcome these challenges by developing OncoSphere, a query engine using the NCI Thesaurus as a nested facet system (NFS) to provide web-based exploration of the Kentucky Cancer Registry data using 3 Specific Aims. In Aim 1 we will develop an approach to transform and implement NCI Thesaurus into an NFS to enable OncoSphere’s interface features. In Aim 2 we will develop methods to perform quality auditing on the hierarchical structure of the NCI Thesaurus to enhance its quality in supporting faceted query for OncoSphere. In Aim 3 we will perform evaluation on OncoSphere’s query expressiveness, query performance and conduct preliminary usability assessment. OncoSphere will break new ground in web-based tools and capitalize on available data resources to accelerate cancer research. We expect OncoSphere and its future versions to become an invaluable resource for the cancer research community. The long-term goal of this study is to create data exploration systems for NCI’s Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program and other related cancer data resources through data science innovations to transform user experience with a new generation of data interaction modalities.",Address;Adopted;Area;Biomedical Research;Characteristics;Clinical Data;Clinical Research;Clinical Trials;Communities;Computer software;Data;Data Science;Databases;Detection;Development;Ensure;Evaluation;Future;Generations;Goals;Kentucky;Knowledge;Lead;Malignant Neoplasms;Metadata;Methods;Modality;NCI Thesaurus;Online Systems;Ontology;Patients;Performance;Privacy;Property;Research Personnel;Resources;Role;SEER Program;Site;Software Tools;Structure;System;Terminology;Time;Translations;Trees;Work;anticancer research;data access;data integration;data management;data registry;data resource;design;experience;human data;improved;innovation;insight;lexical;neoplasm registry;neoplasm resource;novel;query optimization;sound;success;tool;usability;web app;web site;web-based tool,Licong Cui; Guo-Qiang Zhang,Angela B Mariotto,162452,162452,2019-07-04T12:07:00Z,2018-06-06T12:06:00Z,2021-07-31T12:07:00Z,PAR-15-334,nofo_PAR-15-334,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,HOUSTON,tx,UNITED STATES,itcr,org_state,False

However, targeted drugs have failed to produce durable clinical responses when used as single agents in glioblastoma (GBM), the most common and deadly primary brain tumor. Genetically engineered mouse (GEM) models are essential for functional validation of such mutations, but technical limitations have prevented their widespread use in preclinical cancer drug development. The Miller Lab has developed non- germline GEM (nGEM) models. The Berens Lab has performed comprehensive genomic and chemovulnerability profiling in a genetically diverse and faithful panel of patient-derived human xenograft (PDX) models. The Johnson Lab has developed a novel chemical proteomics method, multiplex inhibitor beads coupled with mass spectrometry (MIB-MS), to assess the activation state of the cellular kinome en masse and has shown that dynamic kinome reprogramming contributes to targeted drug resistance. In this Multi-PI project, we will combine our expertise to address the following Aims: (1) To credential PDX models against human GBM by kinome proteomics; (2) To develop genetically-matched nGEM models from distinct cells of origin; and (3) To credential PDX and nGEM models by dynamic kinome profiling. We will develop a genetically diverse panel of nGEM models with defined driver mutations and cellular origins that will be useful adjunct to PDX for preclinical drug development. We will then credential both PDX and nGEM models against resected GBM specimens using cross-species genome, transcriptome, and kinome, and drug response profiling. Models will be genomically matched to their human counterparts and used to develop rational combination therapies that combat single agent resistance mechanisms in genomically- defined tumor subtypes.

1R01CA222148-01A1,R01CA222148,9740709,2019,Conditionally Reprogrammed Cell Model for Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC),"Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most frequently diagnosed cancer (180,890 new cases in 2016) in men in the USA. Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is an effective first line therapy for locally advanced or metastatic disease. Unfortunately, once PCa recurs, the eventual development of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) remains an incurable disease and more effective therapies are needed. Currently, a limited number of cancer cell lines (LnCAP, PC3, DU-145, etc.) are available for research and many genetic mutations present in prostate cancer (e.g., SPOP mutation, FOXA1 mutation, TMPRSS2-ERG fusion, CHD1 loss) are not represented in such cells. New patient-derived cancer models are needed. However, patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models are successful at less than 2-5% efficiency with aggressive, high-grade metastatic tumors and organoid cultures only have an efficiency of 20%. However, our preliminary data demonstrate that conditional reprogramming (CR) has nearly a 100% success rate for establishing long-term cultures from either surgical prostate specimens or CT-guided biopsies. In this application, we propose the following specific aims to validate the potential of CR for translational use in human CRPC. We will first establish CR cultures from biopsies of 30 patients with CRPC and will characterize these culture genetically and phenotypically. Second, we compare the patients' drug response to those of corresponding tumor CR cells and their derivative CR- derived xenografts (CDXs). Lastly, we will use CR cultures in an unbiased high-throughput screen to identify new potential therapies for CRPC in collaboration with Dr. Craig Thomas at National Center for Advanced Translational Sciences (NCATS). New “hits” from the screen will be validated by both in vitro cell assays and xenograft models.",Biopsy;CHD1 gene;Cancer Center;Cancer Model;Cancer Patient;Cancer cell line;Cell model;Cells;Cellular Assay;Collaborations;Cultured Cells;DNA Sequence Alteration;DU145;Data;Development;Disease;Environment;Epithelium;European;Goals;Human;In Vitro;LNCaP;Malignant neoplasm of prostate;Metastatic Prostate Cancer;Modeling;Mutation;National Cancer Institute;Nature;Neoplasm Metastasis;Operative Surgical Procedures;Organoids;PC3 cell line;Paper;Pathway interactions;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phenotype;Prostate;Protocols documentation;Publishing;Research;Research Project Grants;Specimen;TMPRSS2 gene;Technology;Therapeutic Agents;Translational Research;United States;Urology;Work;Xenograft Model;Xenograft procedure;androgen deprivation therapy;anticancer research;cancer diagnosis;castration resistant prostate cancer;cell stroma;docetaxel;drug response prediction;effective therapy;exome sequencing;high throughput screening;men;novel drug class;patient response;prostate cancer cell;response;success;transcriptome;translational model;translational study;tumor;tumor xenograft,Xuefeng Liu,Mariam Eljanne,493219,493219,2019-01-18T12:01:00Z,2019-06-01T12:06:00Z,2023-05-31T12:05:00Z,PAR-17-245,nofo_PAR-17-245,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,WASHINGTON,dc,UNITED STATES,omf,org_state,True

5R01CA204136-03,R01CA204136,9605026,2019,Credentialing murine models for glioblastoma preclinical drug development,"ABSTRACT Precision medicine promises to revolutionize oncology by targeting drugs to specific mutations. However, targeted drugs have failed to produce durable clinical responses when used as single agents in glioblastoma (GBM), the most common and deadly primary brain tumor. Genetically engineered mouse (GEM) models are essential for functional validation of such mutations, but technical limitations have prevented their widespread use in preclinical cancer drug development. The Miller Lab has developed non- germline GEM (nGEM) models. The Berens Lab has performed comprehensive genomic and chemovulnerability profiling in a genetically diverse and faithful panel of patient-derived human xenograft (PDX) models. The Johnson Lab has developed a novel chemical proteomics method, multiplex inhibitor beads coupled with mass spectrometry (MIB-MS), to assess the activation state of the cellular kinome en masse and has shown that dynamic kinome reprogramming contributes to targeted drug resistance. In this Multi-PI project, we will combine our expertise to address the following Aims: (1) To credential PDX models against human GBM by kinome proteomics; (2) To develop genetically-matched nGEM models from distinct cells of origin; and (3) To credential PDX and nGEM models by dynamic kinome profiling. We will develop a genetically diverse panel of nGEM models with defined driver mutations and cellular origins that will be useful adjunct to PDX for preclinical drug development. We will then credential both PDX and nGEM models against resected GBM specimens using cross-species genome, transcriptome, and kinome, and drug response profiling. Models will be genomically matched to their human counterparts and used to develop rational combination therapies that combat single agent resistance mechanisms in genomically- defined tumor subtypes.

Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is an effective first line therapy for locally advanced or metastatic disease. Unfortunately, once PCa recurs, the eventual development of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) remains an incurable disease and more effective therapies are needed. Currently, a limited number of cancer cell lines (LnCAP, PC3, DU-145, etc.) are available for research and many genetic mutations present in prostate cancer (e.g., SPOP mutation, FOXA1 mutation, TMPRSS2-ERG fusion, CHD1 loss) are not represented in such cells. New patient-derived cancer models are needed. However, patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models are successful at less than 2-5% efficiency with aggressive, high-grade metastatic tumors and organoid cultures only have an efficiency of 20%. However, our preliminary data demonstrate that conditional reprogramming (CR) has nearly a 100% success rate for establishing long-term cultures from either surgical prostate specimens or CT-guided biopsies. In this application, we propose the following specific aims to validate the potential of CR for translational use in human CRPC. We will first establish CR cultures from biopsies of 30 patients with CRPC and will characterize these culture genetically and phenotypically. Second, we compare the patients' drug response to those of corresponding tumor CR cells and their derivative CR- derived xenografts (CDXs). Lastly, we will use CR cultures in an unbiased high-throughput screen to identify new potential therapies for CRPC in collaboration with Dr. Craig Thomas at National Center for Advanced Translational Sciences (NCATS).

PEP-CTN clinical trials will incorporate correlative genomics, biology, pharmacology, and imaging studies to further the understanding of the disposition and action of new agents introduced into the treatment of children with cancer. Annually, the PEP-CTN will enroll approximately 120 children and adolescents with cancer onto clinical trials of novel anticancer agents at the 21 core premier pediatric oncology sites throughout the country. The network institutions are selected through a peer review process, and serve as a national and international model for new agent development in pediatric oncology. The PEP- CTN will leverage the database infrastructure and resources of the parent Children's Oncology Group while maintaining its own administrative and operational infrastructure to ensure rapid development, implementation, and reporting of specialized and complex early phase clinical trials. The PEP-CTN has expertise and resources for the conduct of translational biology, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacogenetic studies, and utilizes state-of-the-art informatics systems to facilitate the transfer of response and correlative imaging studies for central review and analyses. The PEP-CTN's primary specific aims are: 1) To safely and efficiently introduce novel anticancer agents into the pediatric setting through the conduct of early phase clinical trials; 2) To expeditiously obtain preliminary efficacy signals through use of phase 2 expansion cohorts and pilot studies in order to inform tumor specific trials that will be conducted across COG sites; 3) To perform genomic analyses, including single gene studies or gene panels, to identify appropriate patients for early phase studies of targeted agents; 4) To identify associations of tumor characteristics with response to new agents using genomic analyses such as whole exome sequencing and RNA sequencing; 5) To incorporate pharmacologic and biologic endpoints, including circulating tumor DNA, other translational laboratory studies, and imaging modalities, into early phase studies, in order to enhance our understanding of the new agents and their effect on tumors..

1U01CA199288-01,U01CA199288,8968148,2015,In Vivo Drug Testing of Pediatric CNS Tumors Using Patient Derived Orthotopic Xenograft Models,"﻿ DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is prepared in response to the funding opportunity: Pediatric Preclinical Testing Consortium Research Programs (U01), RFA-CA-14-018. Specifically, we propose for Type B: Research Program for tumors of central nervous system (CNS) in vivo testing. Brain tumors are the leading cause of cancer-related death in children. One of the challenges in clinical drug development is how to effectively prioritize drug candidates to ensure clinical success in cancer patients. As pediatric drug candidates are much more numerous than the small number of patients, it is essential to perform comprehensive pre-clinical testing to identify the investigational agents that are most likely to be effective in the clinic. However, such effort has been blocked for many years due to the lack of clinically relevant and molecularly accurate model systems. Fortunately, we have established a large panel (>70) of patient derived orthotopic xenograft (PDOX) models of pediatric brain tumors through direct injection of patient tumor specimens into the brains of SCID mice. These PDOX models are shown to have replicated the histopathological features, invasive phenotypes and major genetic abnormalities (gene expression, DNA copy number and gene mutations) of the original primary tumors even during serial sub-transplantations in vivo in mouse brains. The xenograft tumor cells can also be cryopreserved for sustained and on-demand supply of tumorigenic PDOX cells. This capacity combined with our optimized surgical procedure, with which we can implant up to 260 mice per day, makes it possible for us to test multiple (e.g., 6-10) drugs per year for every tumor type. Our objective is therefore to make use of this unique panel of PDOX models to examine therapeutic efficacy of new agents and to analyze mechanisms of action and therapy resistance in high grade glioma, medulloblastoma and ependymoma. Our hypothesis is that these patient-specific PDOX tumors will respond to anti-cancer therapies similarly to the corresponding human primary tumors, and the effective agents identified through this system would have better chances of clinical success. To test this hypothesis, we will perform a series of in vitro and in vivo assays to achieve the following aims: 1) to identify genetically accurate candidate PDOX models that bear the therapeutic target(s) of new investigational drugs through data mining of our mouse model molecular characterization databases; 2) to select the most responsive models through functional in vitro screening to determine time- and dose- responses; 3) to demonstrate therapeutic efficacy of new investigational drugs in multiple target-bearing PDOX models; and 4) to perform detailed analysis of cellular and molecular mechanisms of cell killing as well as the causes of therapy resistance both in vitro and in vivo. Our novel panel of PDOX mouse models represents a broad spectrum of genetic abnormalities of pediatric CNS tumors. All the assays are well established and routinely performed in our laboratory; we are uniquely positioned to accomplish the proposed drug studies in vivo. Our findings should provide strong preclinical evidence to support the initiation of clinical trials.",Animals;Biological Assay;Biological Models;Brain;Brain Neoplasms;Breeding;Cancer Etiology;Cancer Patient;Cells;Central Nervous System Neoplasms;Cessation of life;Child;Childhood;Childhood Brain Neoplasm;Childhood Central Nervous System Neoplasm;Childhood Glioblastoma;Clinic;Clinical;Clinical Drug Development;Clinical Trials;DNA copy number;Data;Databases;Diffuse;Dose;Ensure;Ependymoma;Evaluation;Faculty;Funding Opportunities;Gene Expression;Gene Expression Profiling;Gene Mutation;Glioblastoma;Glioma;Goals;Housing;Human;Image;Implant;In Vitro;Injection of therapeutic agent;Institution;Investigational Drugs;Laboratories;Medicine;Modeling;Molecular;Molecular Abnormality;Molecular Target;Mus;NOD/SCID mouse;New Agents;Operative Surgical Procedures;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phenotype;Pontine structure;Positioning Attribute;Preclinical Drug Evaluation;Preclinical Testing;Primary Neoplasm;Research;Resistance;SCID Mice;Series;Serum-Free Culture Media;Specimen;System;Techniques;Testing;Time;Transplantation;Treatment Efficacy;Ursidae Family;Xenograft Model;Xenograft procedure;animal facility;base;cancer stem cell;cancer therapy;cell bank;cell killing;clinically relevant;cohort;college;cost effective;data mining;drug candidate;drug testing;exome sequencing;experience;implantation;in vivo;medulloblastoma;member;mouse model;neoplastic cell;new therapeutic target;novel;pre-clinical;programs;public health relevance;radioresistant;research clinical testing;response;screening;success;targeted treatment;therapeutic target;tumor;tumor xenograft;tumorigenic,Xiaonan Li,Malcolm M Smith,604258,604258,2015-07-14T12:07:00Z,2015-07-14T12:07:00Z,2020-06-30T12:06:00Z,RFA-CA-14-018,nofo_RFA-CA-14-018,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,HOUSTON,tx,UNITED STATES,pivot,org_state,False

Our lab’s long- term mission is to identify novel molecular targets in osteosarcoma via comprehensive genomic and proteomic profiling of patient-derived cell lines and xenografts as well as human tumors with the ultimate goal of identifying and/or developing and testing therapeutics against these targets. To achieve this goal, we have a) built a robust profiling platform to identify novel targets; b) expanded our repertoire of osteosarcoma patient derived xenograft (PDX) models to reflect disease heterogeneity; and c) conducted high-throughput in vivo testing of 8-10 new agents each year both as part of Pediatric Preclinical Testing Consortium (PPTC) as well as independent of it. All of these efforts form the basis of our current research proposal and place us strongly poised to successfully achieve our goals. Our overall objective is to efficiently evaluate the efficacy of new agents with high potential to have activity in osteosarcoma based on target data from our genomic and proteomic profiling both as single agents and in rational combinations, with the vision of moving effective agents into clinical trials through the Children’s Oncology Group. We have three specific aims- 1) to select and test agents in vivo against surface targets identified by comprehensive proteomic profiling of osteosarcoma xenografts and patient tumors; 2) to select and test agents in vivo against targets identified by comprehensive genomic profiling of osteosarcoma xenografts and patient tumors; and 3) to perform testing of rationally combined agents based on target, toxicity and efficacy data of single agents. Agents from the PPTC pipeline will be selected based on either the proteomic target or genomic alteration being present in at least a subset of available osteosarcoma PDX models. The agent will be tested in selected cohorts of low/ high expressing protein target or present/ absent genomic alteration. In cases with multiple models with target expression, 3-5 mice per model will be used and in cases with few models available, 8-10 mice per model will be used for control and experiment groups with an overall n per arm per experiment of approximately 30 mice. Standard PPTC procedures will be used for tumor implantation and treatment. Tumor dimensions will be measured twice a week and response quantified as per standard PPTC definitions of complete response, maintained complete response, partial response, stable disease and progressive disease. For combination studies, three potential types of combinations will be considered based on efficacy and toxicity data- a) two surface protein targeted agents such as two antibody-drug conjugates; 2) two molecularly targeted agents and 3) a surface protein targeted agent and a molecularly targeted agent.

They not only represent different clinical stage (i.e., at diagnosis, relapse and terminal/autopsy) but also replicate a broad spectrum of the newly identified molecular subtypes of nearly all types of pediatric brain tumors.

Our lab’s long- term mission is to identify novel molecular targets in osteosarcoma via comprehensive genomic and proteomic profiling of patient-derived cell lines and xenografts as well as human tumors with the ultimate goal of identifying and/or developing and testing therapeutics against these targets. To achieve this goal, we have a) built a robust profiling platform to identify novel targets; b) expanded our repertoire of osteosarcoma patient derived xenograft (PDX) models to reflect disease heterogeneity; and c) conducted high-throughput in vivo testing of 8-10 new agents each year both as part of Pediatric Preclinical Testing Consortium (PPTC) as well as independent of it. All of these efforts form the basis of our current research proposal and place us strongly poised to successfully achieve our goals. Our overall objective is to efficiently evaluate the efficacy of new agents with high potential to have activity in osteosarcoma based on target data from our genomic and proteomic profiling both as single agents and in rational combinations, with the vision of moving effective agents into clinical trials through the Children’s Oncology Group. We have three specific aims- 1) to select and test agents in vivo against surface targets identified by comprehensive proteomic profiling of osteosarcoma xenografts and patient tumors; 2) to select and test agents in vivo against targets identified by comprehensive genomic profiling of osteosarcoma xenografts and patient tumors; and 3) to perform testing of rationally combined agents based on target, toxicity and efficacy data of single agents. Agents from the PPTC pipeline will be selected based on either the proteomic target or genomic alteration being present in at least a subset of available osteosarcoma PDX models. The agent will be tested in selected cohorts of low/ high expressing protein target or present/ absent genomic alteration. In cases with multiple models with target expression, 3-5 mice per model will be used and in cases with few models available, 8-10 mice per model will be used for control and experiment groups with an overall n per arm per experiment of approximately 30 mice. Standard PPTC procedures will be used for tumor implantation and treatment. Tumor dimensions will be measured twice a week and response quantified as per standard PPTC definitions of complete response, maintained complete response, partial response, stable disease and progressive disease. For combination studies, three potential types of combinations will be considered based on efficacy and toxicity data- a) two surface protein targeted agents such as two antibody-drug conjugates; 2) two molecularly targeted agents and 3) a surface protein targeted agent and a molecularly targeted agent.

Specifically, we propose for Type B: Research Program for tumors of central nervous system (CNS) in vivo testing. Brain tumors are the leading cause of cancer-related death in children. One of the challenges in clinical drug development is how to effectively prioritize drug candidates to ensure clinical success in cancer patients. As pediatric drug candidates are much more numerous than the small number of patients, it is essential to perform comprehensive pre-clinical testing to identify the investigational agents that are most likely to be effective in the clinic. However, such effort has been blocked for many years due to the lack of clinically relevant and molecularly accurate model systems. Fortunately, we have established a large panel (>70) of patient derived orthotopic xenograft (PDOX) models of pediatric brain tumors through direct injection of patient tumor specimens into the brains of SCID mice. These PDOX models are shown to have replicated the histopathological features, invasive phenotypes and major genetic abnormalities (gene expression, DNA copy number and gene mutations) of the original primary tumors even during serial sub-transplantations in vivo in mouse brains. The xenograft tumor cells can also be cryopreserved for sustained and on-demand supply of tumorigenic PDOX cells. This capacity combined with our optimized surgical procedure, with which we can implant up to 260 mice per day, makes it possible for us to test multiple (e.g., 6-10) drugs per year for every tumor type. Our objective is therefore to make use of this unique panel of PDOX models to examine therapeutic efficacy of new agents and to analyze mechanisms of action and therapy resistance in high grade glioma, medulloblastoma and ependymoma. Our hypothesis is that these patient-specific PDOX tumors will respond to anti-cancer therapies similarly to the corresponding human primary tumors, and the effective agents identified through this system would have better chances of clinical success. To test this hypothesis, we will perform a series of in vitro and in vivo assays to achieve the following aims: 1) to identify genetically accurate candidate PDOX models that bear the therapeutic target(s) of new investigational drugs through data mining of our mouse model molecular characterization databases; 2) to select the most responsive models through functional in vitro screening to determine time- and dose- responses; 3) to demonstrate therapeutic efficacy of new investigational drugs in multiple target-bearing PDOX models; and 4) to perform detailed analysis of cellular and molecular mechanisms of cell killing as well as the causes of therapy resistance both in vitro and in vivo. Our novel panel of PDOX mouse models represents a broad spectrum of genetic abnormalities of pediatric CNS tumors.

Our objective is therefore to make use of this unique panel of PDOX models to examine therapeutic efficacy of new agents and to analyze mechanisms of action and therapy resistance in high grade glioma, medulloblastoma, ependymoma, DIPG and ATRT. Our hypothesis is that these patient-specific PDOX tumors will respond to anti-cancer therapies similarly to the corresponding human primary tumors, and the effective agents identified through this system would have better chances of clinical success. To test this hypothesis, we will perform a series of in vitro and in vivo assays to achieve the following aims: 1) to identify genetically accurate candidate PDOX models that bear the therapeutic target(s) of new investigational drugs through data mining of our mouse model molecular characterization databases; 2) to select the most responsive models through functional in vitro screening to determine time- and dose-responses; 3) to demonstrate therapeutic efficacy of new investigational drugs in multiple target-bearing PDOX models; and 4) to perform detailed analysis of cellular and molecular mechanisms of cell killing as well as the causes of therapy resistance both in vitro and in vivo. Our novel panel of PDOX mouse models represents a broad spectrum of genetic abnormalities of pediatric CNS tumors. All the assays are well established and routinely performed in our laboratory; we are uniquely positioned to accomplish the proposed drug studies in vivo. Our findings should provide strong preclinical evidence to support the initiation of clinical trials.",Animal Model;Animals;Autopsy;Biological Assay;Biological Models;Brain;Brain Neoplasms;Breeding;Cancer Etiology;Cancer Patient;Cells;Central Nervous System Neoplasms;Childhood;Childhood Brain Neoplasm;Childhood Central Nervous System Neoplasm;Childhood Glioblastoma;Clinic;Clinical;Clinical Drug Development;Clinical Trials;Cryopreservation;DNA;DNA methylation profiling;Databases;Diagnosis;Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma;Dose;Drug Screening;Ensure;Ependymoma;Faculty;Funding Opportunities;Gene Expression;Glioblastoma;Glioma;Goals;Grant;Histopathology;Human;Implant;In Vitro;Injections;Institution;Investigational Drugs;Laboratories;Location;Modeling;Molecular;Molecular Abnormality;Molecular Target;Mus;NOD/SCID mouse;New Agents;Operative Surgical Procedures;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacotherapy;Phenotype;Positioning Attribute;Preclinical Testing;Primary Neoplasm;RNA;Recurrent tumor;Relapse;Resistance;SCID Mice;Series;Serum-Free Culture Media;Specimen;System;Techniques;Testing;Time;Transplantation;Treatment Efficacy;Universities;Xenograft Model;Xenograft procedure;animal facility;cancer therapy;cell bank;cell killing;childhood cancer mortality;clinically relevant;cohort;cost effective;data mining;drug action;drug candidate;drug testing;efficacy evaluation;experience;implantation;in vivo;in vivo evaluation;medical schools;medulloblastoma;member;molecular modeling;molecular subtypes;mouse model;neoplastic cell;new therapeutic target;novel;novel anticancer drug;novel therapeutics;pre-clinical;programs;protein biomarkers;radioresistant;response;screening;success;therapeutic evaluation;therapeutic target;tumor;tumor xenograft;tumorigenic,Xiaonan Li,Lori A.

A panel of well characterized osteosarcoma patient derived xenografts with genetic changes recapitulating the disease, have been tested by our laboratory as part of the Pediatric Preclinical Testing Program. These efforts thus far have been highly successful in identifying several drugs which are currently being or about to be tested in osteosarcoma clinical trials conducted by the Children's Oncology Group - specifically eribulin and glembatumumab vedotin. Numerous additional osteosarcoma patient derived xenograft models have been developed potentially permitting expansion of the panel of tumors assessed. In this proposal exploration of using a more efficient approach to screen for drug activity in the established models may permit utilization of a broader panel of osteosarcoma patient derived xenografts. In this proposal eltrombopag will be explored for activity in the treatment of osteosarcoma based on promising in vitro data. Building on prior findings, eribulin will be tested for additive activiy with agents routinely used in the treatment of osteosarcoma including cisplatin, cyclophosphamide and etoposide. Finally, a novel ALK inhibitor that also has IGF-1R inhibitory activity, certinib, will be tested as a single agent and in combination with rapamycin for activityin the osteosarcoma patient derived xenografts. These results can be informative for future osteosarcoma clinical trials development as well as potentially identify novel agents that can be considered for clinical trials.",Acute Myelocytic Leukemia;Address;Adolescent and Young Adult;Agonist;Antimitotic Agents;Cell Line;Child;Childhood;Cisplatin;Clinical;Clinical Trials;Conduct Clinical Trials;Cyclophosphamide;Cytotoxic Chemotherapy;Data;Development;Development Plans;Disease;Drug Combinations;Drug Kinetics;Drug resistance;Ensure;Etoposide;Event;Future;Hormones;IGF1R gene;In Vitro;Incidence;Iron Chelation;Laboratories;Lead;Malignant Bone Neoplasm;Modeling;Molecular;Mus;Mutation;New Agents;Patients;Pediatric Oncology Group;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacodynamics;Phase;Phase II Clinical Trials;Physiological;Preclinical Drug Evaluation;Preclinical Testing;Primary Neoplasm;Process;Recurrence;Reporting;Resistance;Resources;Role;Sampling;Sirolimus;Staging;Syndrome;Testing;Therapeutic;Thrombopoietin;Translating;Translations;Xenograft Model;Xenograft procedure;base;bone;cell killing;chemotherapy;clinically actionable;clinically relevant;cytotoxic;data integration;data sharing;design;drug sensitivity;experience;improved;inhibitor/antagonist;molecular marker;novel;osteosarcoma;pre-clinical;programs;public health relevance;receptor;research clinical testing;response;screening;small molecule;targeted treatment;tumor;young adult,Richard G.

Pathologically, BC is diagnosed as non-muscle-invasive (NMI) and muscle-invasive (MI) disease. Here we define early bladder lesions as NMIBC. Major clinical gaps in NMIBC include i) lack of mechanistic insights defining NMIBC progression, and ii) lack of platform for risk stratification of NMIBC that recur but never progress (“non-progressors”), from those that progresses into MIBC (“progressors”) and consequently demonstrate poor prognosis. The goal of our Center is to tackle this clinical issue by deciphering the underlying mechanisms restraining or promoting the progression of early lesions (Project 1 & 2), and to leverage this novel biology as candidate biomarkers to risk-stratify aggressive NMIBC (Project 3). This proposal seeks to shift the current research paradigm in the field of NMIBC, by proposing a conceptually innovative tug-of-war between a tumor- restraining (Project 1) and a tumor-promoting mechanism (Project 2) in determining the outcome of early bladder lesions/NMIBC in becoming “progressors” or “non-progressors” (Project 3). Clinically, why “non-progressors” often recur but seldom progress, and what are the driving forces advancing “progressors” into MIBC with poor survival remain fundamental questions in field. Our tug-of-war hypothesis with two opposing forces is conceptually different to most other studies, which primarily focus on one side of the coin. Further, the integration of knowledge from Project 1 and 2 as a unified spatial proteomics and transcriptomics map by the Shared Resource Core will reveal spatial and temporal relationships between distinct fibroblast populations with opposing functions, their physical interactions with tumor and immune cell clusters, as well as their relationship to the biomarkers from Project 3. Benchmark of success: The knowledge gained here will shift clinical practice paradigm, by informing future NIMBC management through 1) the development of novel urinary profiling strategies that could risk stratify aggressive NMIBC (Project 1-3); 2) the identification of targets for future precision intervention, either by enhancing/sustaining the tumor-restraining mechanisms (Project 1) and/or inhibiting the tumor-promoting mechanisms (Project 2). The overall success of our program is further ensured by an extraordinary multi-investigator team that integrates three “organ-specific” bladder cancer investigators within Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. All have active R01s and individual NCI-funding track record in performing basic science research, translational bladder cancer research, or leading multi-center clinical trials on the discovery and validation of biomarkers.
