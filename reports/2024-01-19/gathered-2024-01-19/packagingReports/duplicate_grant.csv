grant,2U24CA224285-02,U24CA224285,10729960,2023,MD Anderson Cancer Immune Monitoring and Analysis Center MDA-CIMAC,"ABSTRACT Immunotherapy (IMT) has emerged as a promising treatment strategy across a broad spectrum of human cancers, with multiple agents, particularly immune check point inhibitors, showing promising results in various types of cancers. Its full potential has yet to be realized, due in part, to a lack of biomarkers predicting response to treatment. Multiple immune and genomic biomarkers of response based on analysis of pre-treatment specimens have been described but most are not very robust with significant overlap between responders and non-responders. Therefore, there is a critical unmet need to perform comprehensive characterization of candidate biomarkers in early phase IMT trials using standardized assays and novel methodologies. Recognizing the need for comprehensive immune monitoring for IMT clinical trials, in 2017 NCI developed the Cancer Immune Monitoring and Analysis Center (CIMAC) and Cancer Immunologic Data Commons (CIDC) Network, with the goal of identifying biomarkers of response, resistance, and adverse events to optimize immunotherapy approaches for patients with cancer. The MD Anderson Cancer Immune Monitoring and Analysis Center (MDA-CIMAC) is one of four CIMAC sites established five years ago that has been standardizing genomic, pathology and immunology assays and supporting profiling of tissue and blood specimens from patients treated in IMT trials. The MDA-CIMAC will be co-led by Drs. Ignacio Wistuba, renowned cancer surgical and molecular pathologist, Gheath Al-Atrash, well-known medical oncologist with expertise in stem cell transplantation and immunotherapy, and Cara Haymaker, cancer immunologist with expertise in immune biomarker analysis. They will be supported by a multidisciplinary team of world-class and highly collaborative experts on cancer and immunotherapy. The main goals of MDA-CIMAC are to: 1) provide a centralized and harmonized platform for sample collection, processing and quality assurance, and 2) use analytically-validated and standardized (Tiers 1 and 2) and highly innovative (Tier 3) assays to offer analyses for phenotypic, genomic, and functional characterization of responses of patients enrolled on IMT clinical trials. In Aim 1, we will utilize Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) following the developed CIMAC umbrella protocol to provide services for processing and distribution of annotated biospecimens from the NCI-sponsored early phase immunotherapy clinical trials and to link the specimens to relevant clinical, pathological, immune and molecular data within the CIMAC-CIDC Network. In Aim 2, we will perform routine and innovative pathological, immunological and molecular analyses using standardized and validated and highly innovative assays to aid the completion of NCI- sponsored early phase clinical trials and the development of novel predictive IMT biomarkers. In Aim 3, in conjunction with the CIDC team, we will provide biostatistics and computational services for data collection and analysis, and will perform, interpret and predict modeling of high dimensional (omic) data. We envision that the MDA-CIMAC will be indispensable as we make meaningful progress in cancer immunotherapeutic approaches.",Adverse event;Affect;Basic Science;Bioinformatics;Biological Assay;Biological Markers;Biometry;Blood;Blood specimen;Cancer Center;Cancer Patient;Categories;Cells;Clinical;Clinical Sciences;Complex;Computer software;Data;Data Analyses;Data Collection;Data Commons;Databases;Development;Disease;Genomics;Goals;Human;Immune;Immune checkpoint inhibitor;Immune response;Immune system;Immunologic Markers;Immunologic Monitoring;Immunologics;Immunologist;Immunology;Immunotherapeutic agent;Immunotherapy;Infrastructure;Integration Host Factors;Knowledge;Lateral;Lead;Link;Liquid substance;Malignant Neoplasms;Medical Oncologist;Methodology;Molecular;Molecular Analysis;Molecular Profiling;Outcome;Pathologic;Pathologist;Pathology;Patients;Phase;Phenotype;Procedures;Process;Protocols documentation;Publishing;Quality Control;Reporting;Research;Research Personnel;Resistance;Resources;Sampling;Secure;Services;Site;Specimen;Standardization;Stem cell transplant;System;Technology;Therapeutic;Tissues;Validation;anti-cancer;biomarker development;biomarker identification;biomarker signature;cancer immunotherapeutics;cancer immunotherapy;cancer surgery;cancer type;candidate marker;clinically relevant;data integration;data management;data quality;design;early phase clinical trial;experimental study;genomic biomarker;genomic data;genomic platform;high dimensionality;immune checkpoint;immunotherapy clinical trials;immunotherapy trials;improved;inhibitor;innovation;multidisciplinary;next generation;novel;participant enrollment;patient response;predictive marker;predictive modeling;prospective;quality assurance;responders and non-responders;response;response biomarker;sample collection;standard of care;translational potential;treatment optimization;treatment response;treatment strategy;tumor;tumor immunology;tumor microenvironment;web services,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,HOUSTON,TX,UNITED STATES,Gheath Al-Atrash;Cara L Haymaker;Ignacio I.

For Tier 1 assays, we propose CyTOF, singleplex IHC, Olink, TCRseq and RNAseq. For Tier 2, we propose single-cell TCRseq, MIBI, ATACseq, and CyTOF proteomics. For Tier 3, we propose single-cell glycan imaging (by MALDI-ToF), spatial transcriptomics (Nanostring DSP platform), and single-cell genomics/proteomics (Mission Bio Tapestri and BD Rhapsody platforms). We will use longitudinal reference materials for tracking inter-batch and inter-project consistency. We will assess quality control measures on all assays before uploading data to the Cancer Immune Data Commons (CIDC) according to their specifications. We will also perform biostatistical analysis of results for all assays performed, in relation to clinical outcome data.

Most clinical trials of novel combinations either fail to include any support for complex correlative biomarker discovery, often due to costs of specimen collection and assays, or are performed in an idiosyncratic manner, making non- standardized data difficult to integrate as part of a larger repository. There is a need to go beyond just PD-L1 tissue expression and tumor mutation burden as FDA-approved yet imperfect predictors of immune checkpoint blockade, by generating high-dimensional datasets that characterize the tumor immune microenvironment, systemic circulating immune and proteomic markers from blood, and host-level immune fitness information (microbiome). The Cancer Immune Monitoring and Analysis Centers, Cancer Immunologic Data Commons, and Partnership for Accelerating Cancer Therapies (CIMAC-CIDC-PACT) is a Cancer Moonshot-funded network that brings together laboratory, clinical, and computational scientists, administrators, and regulatory specialists from four institutions, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (ISMMS), MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC), Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI), and Stanford University. Our unprecedented, coordinated effort to conduct IO clinical trial correlative studies and define new candidate biomarkers to improve immunotherapy had resulted in 37 clinical trials selected in the first funding period, with ongoing datasets resulted for 17 of them. This was achieved using rigorously assessed SOPs and processes from trial selection to data sharing. We propose to continue and expand these efforts as follows: A set of well-established, harmonized, high-dimensional tumor and blood-based assays will be applied to all newly selected trials, with the aim of evaluating and validating novel biomarker of treatment, clinical response, and/or adverse events (Aim 1). To spur innovation and increase granularity of our understanding of mechanism of action, high-tech yet validated single cell and spatial transcriptomic technologies as well as other omics will be proposed in exceptional patients for unbiased phenotyping, tissue composition, architectural organization, and immune profiling (Aim 2). The resulting unified data repository will be mined to define multi-omic and cross-trial markers, through biostatistical and computational innovative design to integrate datasets from various assays into higher analytical archetypes across studies (Aim 3). Together, our network is at the forefront of immune monitoring standards, by balancing innovation with reproducibility, to comprehensively assess biomarkers and strive for precision cancer treatment. We are poised to create an unparalleled resource of harmonized, clinically annotated datasets shared with the public that will establish best practice guidelines with the research community.

Aim 3 addresses the challenge of integrating multiomic data across an increasing number of clinical trials by building novel computational tools that can efficiently process massive amounts of data and generate interpretable representations of the results.

Neoantigen load predicts immunotherapeutic response, validating antigen identification as a rational strategy of biomarker discovery. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) however has shown limited efficacy to checkpoint blockade immunotherapy due to presumed neoantigen paucity. However, systematic antigen discovery in PDAC is lacking. 3% of PDAC patients survive > 5 years (long term survivors). As T cell immunity may explain this extreme outcome, they represent the ideal cohort for deep antigen discovery. Using genomic, molecular, and cellular immunoprofiling, computational evolutionary modeling, and neoantigen discovery in these rare long term survivors (n=82), we have discovered that neoantigen quality, but not quantity, is prognostic of survival, and that long term survivors evidence lasting neoantigen-specific T cell immunity. The scientific objectives of this proposal are to address questions essential to translate these findings - 1) is there stage and treatment- specific neoantigen heterogeneity, 2) can neoantigens be identified in the peripheral blood, and 3) can neoantigen quality predict response to immunotherapy. The translational objective is to develop novel tissue and blood-based biomarkers for rational patient and target selection for immunotherapy. The proposal utilizes several highly unique tissue collection strategies  a) laparoscopic multi-site biopsies to identify stage-specific heterogeneity, b) serial pre- and post-chemotherapy assessment for treatment-specific modulation, and c) evaluation of neoantigen quality as a predictive biomarker on a large, immunotherapeutic PDAC trial. This initiative will also for the first time develop the ability to identify neoantigens in circulating exosomes for blood-based biomarker assessment. The research methodology employs next generation sequencing, transcriptional profiling, computational biophysical modeling, clonotypic T cell profiling, neoantigen discovery, and functional assessments to evaluate the prognostic, predictive, and therapeutic potential of neoantigens. The team comprises of world-class expert junior and senior investigators in a broad range of highly relevant disciplines from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Meyer Cancer Center at the Weill Cornell Medical Center, Tisch Cancer Institute at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and the Institute for Advanced Study.

Recent progress has identified essential barriers in this complex microenvironment that impede drug delivery and suppress immunity. These processes include the prohibitive interstitial pressures generated by high concentrations of hyaluronan (HA) complexed with water, dense fibrosis associated with fibrillar collagen deposition, and multiple classes of immunosuppressive and pro-tumorigenic cells such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells and macrophages. The team assembled in this project has made many of the seminal discoveries described above. In addition, we have developed several highly novel and powerful experimental platforms to rigorously interrogate the complex mechanisms and interactions among various compartments in the tumor microenvironment that collectively conspire to promote the survival of pancreas cancers and metastases and thwart treatment. Our overarching hypothesis is that significantly improving survival for PDA patients will require targeting not only the tumor epithelial cell, but also the three compartments that support its oncogenesis: hematopoietic, mesenchymal and extracellular matrix. In the following, we propose to investigate the combination of cytotoxic therapy with stromal disruption and myeloid cell modulations to maximize engagement of anti-tumor immunity and treatment efficacy. We will pursue these investigations in four distinct experimental platforms that offer complementary strengths and mitigate limitations: 1) genetically engineered mouse models (GEMM) of autochthonous PDA; 2) syngeneic allografts; 3) patient-derived xenograft (PDX) systems; and 4) patient-derived organoids (PDO).",Allografting;Alpha Cell;Architecture;Autologous;Behavior;Biological Models;Biology;Blood Vessels;Cancer Etiology;Cell Therapy;Cells;Cessation of life;Characteristics;Clinic;Coculture Techniques;Collagen;Complement;Complex;Cytotoxic Chemotherapy;Deposition;Disease;Disease Progression;Drug Delivery Systems;Education;Elements;Epithelial Cells;Evolution;Experimental Models;Extracellular Matrix;Extracellular Matrix Proteins;Fibrillar Collagen;Fibroblasts;Fibrosis;Friends;Functional disorder;Gel;Genetically Engineered Mouse;Glycosaminoglycans;Hematopoietic;Human;Hyaluronan;Immune;Immune response;Immunity;Immunosuppression;Immunosuppressive Agents;Investigation;Liquid substance;Malignant neoplasm of pancreas;Mechanics;Mesenchymal;Minority;Modeling;Mus;Myelogenous;Myeloid Cells;Myofibroblast;Neoplasm Metastasis;Normal tissue morphology;Organ;Organoids;Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma;Pathogenesis;Patients;Perfusion;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phase;Physiologic pulse;Physiology;Population;Process;Proteoglycan;Regimen;Research Personnel;Seminal;Series;Signal Transduction;Suppressor-Effector T-Lymphocytes;Surface;System;T-Lymphocyte;Toxic effect;Treatment Efficacy;Treatment Protocols;Tumor Immunity;Tumorigenicity;Water;Xenograft procedure;cell type;combinatorial;cytotoxic;hypoperfusion;improved;insight;interstitial;macrophage;monocyte;mouse model;next generation;novel;novel therapeutics;pressure;receptor;reconstitution;response;standard of care;therapy resistant;treatment strategy;tumor;tumor growth;tumor microenvironment;tumorigenesis;tumorigenic,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,SEATTLE,WA,UNITED STATES,Sunil R Hingorani,Jeffrey Hildesheim,1846829,1846829,2017-09-25T12:09:00Z,2017-09-30T12:09:00Z,2020-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-17-015,True duplicate in all columns.

The mechanisms underlying this benefit include normalization of cancer-associated fibroblasts and extracellular matrix (ECM), resulting in blood vessel decompression, improved perfusion, and decreased hypoxia. These exciting preclinical findings formed the basis of an ongoing Phase II clinical trial at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), which combines losartan with cytotoxic therapy  FOLFIRINOX and then chemoradiotherapy in unresectable locally advanced PDAC (NCT01821729). An interim analysis of this trial indicates that adding losartan to neoadjuvant cytotoxic therapy doubles the frequency of conversion to resectable tumors (52%) and strikingly improves overall survival (OS) in these PDAC patients. Remarkably, transcriptomic analysis of tumor biopsies from PDAC patients further indicates that ASI treatment not only normalizes ECM-related phenotypes but also upregulates key pathways associated with anti-tumor immunity involving both adaptive (e.g., CD8+ T cells) and innate (e.g., dendritic cells (DCs)) immune components of the PDAC tumor microenvironment. Based on these preclinical and clinical findings, we hypothesize that ASIs in combination with cytotoxic agents will reprogram the heterogeneous, pro-fibrotic, and immunosuppressive PDAC tumor microenvironment to one that is immunostimulatory. We further propose that combining ASIs and cytotoxic agents will enhance the delivery and efficacy of immunotherapies, which until now have had limited or no benefit in PDAC patients. To test these hypotheses, we designed three Specific Aims: 1) Uncover how losartan combined with cytotoxic agents alters tumor microenvironmental components (ECM, blood vessels, hypoxia) and immune cells, in locally advanced PDAC patients; 2) Dissect the causal role of drug- induced adaptive and innate immune cells in the anti-tumor response in orthotopic (implanted and genetically engineered) PDAC models in mice; and 3) Evaluate whether combining ASI-induced tumor microenvironment reprogramming along with cytotoxic therapies enhances the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockers. Based on our preclinical and clinical data, our tightly integrated and multidisciplinary team of investigators, and our bench-to-bedside-and-back research approach, we anticipate that successful completion of these studies will positively impact the development of new treatments for locally advanced PDAC patients who currently have a 5-year survival rate of ~11%. Moreover, because we will actively participate in the PDAC Consortium, the knowledge gained in these studies will be available for other studies of the immune tumor microenvironment in PDAC that are undertaken within the Consortium.

Although recent advances in immunotherapy have shown efficacy in various solid cancers, comparable efficacy in PDAC has been limited by a complex tumor microenvironment (TME) that creates an immune suppressive milieu ripe for tumor progression. Thus, bold interventions that can overcome immune barriers in the PDAC TME are urgently needed to reduce the mortality stemming from this recalcitrant disease. The U01 Consortium for PDAC Translational Studies on the TME was created through the National Cancer Moonshot initiative to accelerate the pace of progress in innovative therapies targeting the TME in PDAC, especially those geared towards immune-based modalities. Our proposal is in response to the companion U24 RFA to create a resource center for the five funded Consortium sites, which we call Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma Translational Resource Center (PATReC). The PATReC will be co-led by Drs. Ignacio Wistuba and Anirban Maitra, two established molecular pathologists at UT MD Anderson Cancer Center (UTMDACC) with long-standing expertise in cancer biomarkers, tissue based molecular profiling, and with respect to one co-leader (AM), specific expertise in PDAC biology, disease models and experimental therapeutics. They will be supported by an exceptional supporting cast, including Drs. Jack Lee (biostatistics), Andy Futreal (cancer genomics and computational biology), Jason Roszik (bioinformatics) and Stan Hamilton (co-leader of the NCI MATCH biorepository). The overall goal is to support the consortium efforts in multiple areas including: providing an administrative infrastructure for coordinated interactions amongst the U01 awardees; facilitating centralized biospecimen banking and distribution; enabling centralized data storage capabilities; and credentialed biostatistics and bioinformatics support with the ultimate goal of designing translationally relevant combination interventions targeting the TME in PDAC. In Aim 1, we will support administrative coordination amongst the U01 sites by ensuring effective communication, cooperation, and access to rapid data exchange that will advance the goals of the individual Consortium sites. The PATReC will serve as the central hub for virtual and in-person communication across the entire Consortium. In Aim 2, we will utilize our unique institutional infrastructure to provide centralized data management services that will be readily accessible to all Consortium sites via a secure website, and provide bioinformatics and biostatics services for the analyses and interpretation of data. In Aim 3, we will standardize bio-banking activities and develop standard operation procedures (SOPs) for biospecimen collection, processing and distribution, as well as provide access to biologically relevant PDAC preclinical resources. We envision that the PATReC will be an indispensable element as we make meaningful progress towards targeting the TME in this lethal disease.",Administrative Coordination;Algorithms;Antigens;Archives;Area;Bioinformatics;Biological;Biology;Biometry;Cancer Center;Cancer Etiology;Cataloging;Catalogs;Cell Line;Cessation of life;Clinical Research;Clinical Trials;Clinical Trials Data Monitoring Committees;Collection;Communication;Companions;Complex;Computational Biology;Credentialing;Data;Data Analyses;Data Storage and Retrieval;Diagnosis;Disease;Disease model;Elements;Enrollment;Ensure;Facility Accesses;Funding;Goals;Image Analysis;Immune;Immunofluorescence Immunologic;Immunologic Monitoring;Immunotherapeutic agent;Immunotherapy;Incidence;Individual;Innovative Therapy;Institution;Intervention;Investigational Therapies;Laboratory Research;Lead;Logistics;Malignant Neoplasms;Manuals;Methodology;Modality;Molecular;Molecular Profiling;Online Systems;Organ;Organoids;Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma;Participant;Pathologic;Pathologist;Pathology;Patients;Persons;Play;Procedures;Reagent;Research Design;Research Infrastructure;Research Personnel;Resources;Role;Secure;Services;Site;Solid;Standardization;Survival Rate;Teleconferences;Therapeutic;Tissue Microarray;Tissues;Translational Research;Treatment Efficacy;United States;Xenograft procedure;base;biobank;cancer biomarkers;cancer genomics;cancer immunotherapy;clinically relevant;comparative efficacy;computerized tools;data exchange;data management;design;immune function;improved;innovation;material transfer agreement;meetings;member;mortality;multidisciplinary;operation;outcome forecast;pre-clinical;preclinical study;programs;prospective;response;stem;synergism;targeted treatment;tool;translational study;tumor microenvironment;tumor progression;virtual;web site,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,HOUSTON,TX,UNITED STATES,Anirban Maitra;Ignacio I.

Recent progress has identified essential barriers in this complex microenvironment that impede drug delivery and suppress immunity. These processes include the prohibitive interstitial pressures generated by high concentrations of hyaluronan (HA) complexed with water, dense fibrosis associated with fibrillar collagen deposition, and multiple classes of immunosuppressive and pro-tumorigenic cells such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells and macrophages. The team assembled in this project has made many of the seminal discoveries described above. In addition, we have developed several highly novel and powerful experimental platforms to rigorously interrogate the complex mechanisms and interactions among various compartments in the tumor microenvironment that collectively conspire to promote the survival of pancreas cancers and metastases and thwart treatment. Our overarching hypothesis is that significantly improving survival for PDA patients will require targeting not only the tumor epithelial cell, but also the three compartments that support its oncogenesis: hematopoietic, mesenchymal and extracellular matrix. In the following, we propose to investigate the combination of cytotoxic therapy with stromal disruption and myeloid cell modulations to maximize engagement of anti-tumor immunity and treatment efficacy. We will pursue these investigations in four distinct experimental platforms that offer complementary strengths and mitigate limitations: 1) genetically engineered mouse models (GEMM) of autochthonous PDA; 2) syngeneic allografts; 3) patient-derived xenograft (PDX) systems; and 4) patient-derived organoids (PDO).",Allografting;Architecture;Autologous;Behavior;Biological Models;Biology;Blood Vessels;Cancer Etiology;Cell Therapy;Cells;Cessation of life;Characteristics;Clinic;Coculture Techniques;Collagen;Complement;Complex;Cytotoxic Chemotherapy;Deposition;Disease;Disease Progression;Drug Delivery Systems;Education;Elements;Epithelial Cells;Evolution;Experimental Models;Extracellular Matrix;Extracellular Matrix Proteins;Fibrillar Collagen;Fibroblasts;Fibrosis;Friends;Functional disorder;Gel;Genetically Engineered Mouse;Glycosaminoglycans;Hematopoietic;Human;Hyaluronan;Immune;Immune response;Immunity;Immunosuppression;Immunotherapeutic agent;Investigation;Liquid substance;Malignant neoplasm of pancreas;Mechanics;Mesenchymal;Minority;Modeling;Mus;Myeloid Cells;Myeloid-derived suppressor cells;Myofibroblast;Neoplasm Metastasis;Normal tissue morphology;Organ;Organoids;Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma;Pathogenesis;Patients;Perfusion;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phase;Physiologic pulse;Physiology;Population;Process;Proteoglycan;Regimen;Research Personnel;Seminal;Series;Signal Transduction;Structure;Surface;System;T-Lymphocyte;Toxic effect;Treatment Efficacy;Treatment Protocols;Tumor Immunity;Water;Xenograft procedure;barrier to care;cell type;combinatorial;cytotoxic;hypoperfusion;improved;insight;interstitial;macrophage;monocyte;mouse model;next generation;novel;novel therapeutics;pressure;receptor;reconstitution;response;standard of care;therapy resistant;treatment strategy;tumor;tumor growth;tumor microenvironment;tumor-immune system interactions;tumorigenesis;tumorigenic,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,SEATTLE,WA,UNITED STATES,Sunil R Hingorani,Jeffrey Hildesheim,602955,602955,2020-09-01T12:09:00Z,2017-09-30T12:09:00Z,2022-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-17-015,True duplicate in all columns.

grant,4U01CA224348-02,U01CA224348,10242459,2020,Reprogramming PDAC tumor microenvironment to improve immunotherapy,"We have recently shown in preclinical studies using clinically relevant pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) models that angiotensin system inhibitors (ASIs), including the angiotensin receptor blocker losartan, can enhance the delivery and efficacy of cytotoxic agents by affecting the tumor microenvironment (PNAS 2011, Nat Commun 2013). The mechanisms underlying this benefit include normalization of cancer-associated fibroblasts and extracellular matrix (ECM), resulting in blood vessel decompression, improved perfusion, and decreased hypoxia. These exciting preclinical findings formed the basis of an ongoing Phase II clinical trial at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), which combines losartan with cytotoxic therapy  FOLFIRINOX and then chemoradiotherapy in unresectable locally advanced PDAC (NCT01821729). An interim analysis of this trial indicates that adding losartan to neoadjuvant cytotoxic therapy doubles the frequency of conversion to resectable tumors (52%) and strikingly improves overall survival (OS) in these PDAC patients. Remarkably, transcriptomic analysis of tumor biopsies from PDAC patients further indicates that ASI treatment not only normalizes ECM-related phenotypes but also upregulates key pathways associated with anti-tumor immunity involving both adaptive (e.g., CD8+ T cells) and innate (e.g., dendritic cells (DCs)) immune components of the PDAC tumor microenvironment. Based on these preclinical and clinical findings, we hypothesize that ASIs in combination with cytotoxic agents will reprogram the heterogeneous, pro-fibrotic, and immunosuppressive PDAC tumor microenvironment to one that is immunostimulatory. We further propose that combining ASIs and cytotoxic agents will enhance the delivery and efficacy of immunotherapies, which until now have had limited or no benefit in PDAC patients. To test these hypotheses, we designed three Specific Aims: 1) Uncover how losartan combined with cytotoxic agents alters tumor microenvironmental components (ECM, blood vessels, hypoxia) and immune cells, in locally advanced PDAC patients; 2) Dissect the causal role of drug- induced adaptive and innate immune cells in the anti-tumor response in orthotopic (implanted and genetically engineered) PDAC models in mice; and 3) Evaluate whether combining ASI-induced tumor microenvironment reprogramming along with cytotoxic therapies enhances the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockers. Based on our preclinical and clinical data, our tightly integrated and multidisciplinary team of investigators, and our bench-to-bedside-and-back research approach, we anticipate that successful completion of these studies will positively impact the development of new treatments for locally advanced PDAC patients who currently have a 5-year survival rate of ~11%. Moreover, because we will actively participate in the PDAC Consortium, the knowledge gained in these studies will be available for other studies of the immune tumor microenvironment in PDAC that are undertaken within the Consortium.

Although recent advances in immunotherapy have shown efficacy in various solid cancers, comparable efficacy in PDAC has been limited by a complex tumor microenvironment (TME) that creates an immune suppressive milieu ripe for tumor progression. Thus, bold interventions that can overcome immune barriers in the PDAC TME are urgently needed to reduce the mortality stemming from this recalcitrant disease. The U01 Consortium for PDAC Translational Studies on the TME was created through the National Cancer Moonshot initiative to accelerate the pace of progress in innovative therapies targeting the TME in PDAC, especially those geared towards immune-based modalities. Our proposal is in response to the companion U24 RFA to create a resource center for the five funded Consortium sites, which we call Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma Translational Resource Center (PATReC). The PATReC will be co-led by Drs. Ignacio Wistuba and Anirban Maitra, two established molecular pathologists at UT MD Anderson Cancer Center (UTMDACC) with long-standing expertise in cancer biomarkers, tissue based molecular profiling, and with respect to one co-leader (AM), specific expertise in PDAC biology, disease models and experimental therapeutics. They will be supported by an exceptional supporting cast, including Drs. Jack Lee (biostatistics), Andy Futreal (cancer genomics and computational biology), Jason Roszik (bioinformatics) and Stan Hamilton (co-leader of the NCI MATCH biorepository). The overall goal is to support the consortium efforts in multiple areas including: providing an administrative infrastructure for coordinated interactions amongst the U01 awardees; facilitating centralized biospecimen banking and distribution; enabling centralized data storage capabilities; and credentialed biostatistics and bioinformatics support with the ultimate goal of designing translationally relevant combination interventions targeting the TME in PDAC. In Aim 1, we will support administrative coordination amongst the U01 sites by ensuring effective communication, cooperation, and access to rapid data exchange that will advance the goals of the individual Consortium sites. The PATReC will serve as the central hub for virtual and in-person communication across the entire Consortium. In Aim 2, we will utilize our unique institutional infrastructure to provide centralized data management services that will be readily accessible to all Consortium sites via a secure website, and provide bioinformatics and biostatics services for the analyses and interpretation of data. In Aim 3, we will standardize bio-banking activities and develop standard operation procedures (SOPs) for biospecimen collection, processing and distribution, as well as provide access to biologically relevant PDAC preclinical resources. We envision that the PATReC will be an indispensable element as we make meaningful progress towards targeting the TME in this lethal disease.",Administrative Coordination;Algorithms;Antigens;Archives;Area;Bioinformatics;Biological;Biology;Biometry;Cancer Center;Cancer Etiology;Cataloging;Catalogs;Cell Line;Cessation of life;Clinical Management;Clinical Research;Clinical Trials;Clinical Trials Data Monitoring Committees;Collection;Communication;Companions;Complex;Computational Biology;Credentialing;Data;Data Analyses;Data Storage and Retrieval;Diagnosis;Disease;Disease model;Elements;Enrollment;Ensure;Facility Accesses;Funding;Goals;Immune;Immunofluorescence Immunologic;Immunologic Monitoring;Immunotherapeutic agent;Immunotherapy;Incidence;Individual;Infrastructure;Innovative Therapy;Institution;Intervention;Investigational Therapies;Laboratory Research;Lead;Logistics;Malignant Neoplasms;Manuals;Methodology;Modality;Molecular;Molecular Profiling;Organ;Organoids;Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma;Participant;Pathologic;Pathologist;Pathology;Patients;Persons;Play;Procedures;Reagent;Research Design;Research Personnel;Resources;Role;Secure;Services;Site;Solid;Standardization;Survival Rate;Teleconferences;Therapeutic;Tissue Microarray;Tissues;Translational Research;Treatment Efficacy;United States;Xenograft procedure;automated image analysis;base;biobank;cancer biomarkers;cancer genomics;cancer immunotherapy;clinically relevant;comparative efficacy;computerized tools;data dissemination;data exchange;data management;data tools;design;immune function;improved;innovation;material transfer agreement;meetings;member;mortality;multidisciplinary;operation;outcome forecast;pre-clinical;preclinical study;programs;prospective;response;stem;synergism;targeted treatment;tool;translational study;tumor microenvironment;tumor progression;virtual;web portal;web site,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,HOUSTON,TX,UNITED STATES,Anirban Maitra;Subrata Sen,Peter Ujhazy,559976,559976,2020-09-03T12:09:00Z,2017-09-30T12:09:00Z,2022-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-17-016,True duplicate in all columns.

One possible reason for this is the unique biology of the pancreatic cancer in establishing an immune suppressive microenvironment. We find that cross communication between cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs), tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) and tumor cells is critical. Using animal models of PDA, we find that tumor cells polarize macrophages to TAMs both by activating CAFs to produce IL6 and by producing specific metabolites. TAMs then both suppress the immune response by arginine depletion by making Arginase 1 and by producing EGFR ligands, primarily HBEGF, to stimulate pancreatic cancer cells to express PDL1, an immune checkpoint ligand. We propose to use a combination of matched humanized patient derived xenografts (PDXs), organoid culture systems made up of cancer cells, immune cells and CAFs (ie microtumors) and a unique dual recombinase genetically engineered mouse model of PDA to test the hypothesis that treatment of tumors with inhibitors of STAT3, HBEGF, ARG1 or MEK will effectively synergize with PD1 inhibition, overcoming the powerful immune suppression created by the pancreatic cancer microenvironment.",Ablation;Affect;Animal Model;Antigen-Antibody Complex;Arginine;Biocompatible Materials;Biological Models;Biology;CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes;Cancer Patient;Cell Communication;Cells;Communication;Complex;DTR gene;Engineering;Environment;Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor;Epithelial;Feedback;Fibroblasts;Genetically Engineered Mouse;Goals;Growth Factor;Human;IL6 gene;Immune;Immune checkpoint inhibitor;Immune response;Immune system;Immunosuppression;Immunotherapeutic agent;Immunotherapy;In Vitro;Infiltration;Inflammatory;Interruption;Lead;Ligands;MAP Kinase Gene;MEK inhibition;MEKs;Malignant Neoplasms;Malignant neoplasm of pancreas;Mediating;Methods;Michigan;Modality;Myelogenous;Myeloid Cells;Myeloid-derived suppressor cells;Neoplasm Metastasis;Neoplasm Transplantation;Organoids;PD-1/PD-L1;Pancreas;Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma;Patients;Phenotype;Pre-Clinical Model;Process;Research;Research Personnel;Research Proposals;Role;STAT3 gene;Schools;Scientist;Series;Signal Transduction;System;T-Lymphocyte;Testing;Therapeutic;Transplantation;Tumor-associated macrophages;Universities;Work;anti-tumor immune response;arginase;base;cancer cell;cancer immunotherapeutics;cancer therapy;checkpoint therapy;combat;cytokine;experience;fighting;immune checkpoint;in vivo;inhibitor/antagonist;innovation;intercellular communication;macrophage;medical schools;neoplastic cell;novel;pancreatic cancer cells;pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cell;pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma model;pancreatic neoplasm;patient derived xenograft model;polarized cell;programmed cell death ligand 1;programmed cell death protein 1;recombinase;response;scaffold;tumor;tumor growth;tumor microenvironment;tumor-immune system interactions,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,ANN ARBOR,MI,UNITED STATES,Howard C Crawford;Marina Pasca Di Magliano,Jeffrey Hildesheim,527973,527973,2021-07-29T12:07:00Z,2017-09-30T12:09:00Z,2023-02-28T12:02:00Z,RFA-CA-17-015,True duplicate in all columns.

Despite success in other cancer types, immunotherapy approaches in PDAC have not shown efficacy. PDAC demonstrates a heterogeneous and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) that is poorly understood and serves as a barrier to effective immunotherapy strategies in this disease. We propose that an improved understanding of the TME and novel approaches that target key tumor-stroma interactions will enable remodeling of the immunosuppressive TME to enhance the efficacy of current and future immunotherapy strategies. In particular, we believe that successful combination immunotherapy approaches in PDAC will include strategies that alter myeloid cells to relieve immunosuppression, cytotoxic therapies that target tumor cells to improve immune response, and agents that augment anti-tumor T cell activity. In this project, we will perform a comprehensive characterization of the PDAC TME in both primary and metastatic PDAC in the baseline untreated context as well as across multiple different clinical therapies. In Aim 1, we will utilize single-cell transcriptomic and proteomic technologies to provide a cellular atlas of the PDAC TME at unprecedented resolution. In Aim 2, we will examine how the PDAC TME changes with chemotherapy, radiation therapy and a novel CCR2 inhibitor that modulates macrophage recruitment in the TME. For these studies, we will utilize human samples derived from both resectable and metastatic patients on clinical trials at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. We will employ a novel ex vivo co-culture approach to enable rapid functional evaluation of tumor-stroma interactions and how they may impact immunotherapy responses. Lastly, in Aim 3 we will employ faithful immune competent PDAC mouse models and a novel cytokine delivery platform to investigate how targeted cytokine delivery to the TME may alter myeloid cell recruitment and function and improve immune responses.

These processes include the prohibitive interstitial pressures generated by high concentrations of hyaluronan (HA) complexed with water, dense fibrosis associated with fibrillar collagen deposition, and multiple classes of immunosuppressive and pro-tumorigenic cells such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells and macrophages. The team assembled in this project has made many of the seminal discoveries described above. In addition, we have developed several highly novel and powerful experimental platforms to rigorously interrogate the complex mechanisms and interactions among various compartments in the tumor microenvironment that collectively conspire to promote the survival of pancreas cancers and metastases and thwart treatment. Our overarching hypothesis is that significantly improving survival for PDA patients will require targeting not only the tumor epithelial cell, but also the three compartments that support its oncogenesis: hematopoietic, mesenchymal and extracellular matrix. In the following, we propose to investigate the combination of cytotoxic therapy with stromal disruption and myeloid cell modulations to maximize engagement of anti-tumor immunity and treatment efficacy. We will pursue these investigations in four distinct experimental platforms that offer complementary strengths and mitigate limitations: 1) genetically engineered mouse models (GEMM) of autochthonous PDA; 2) syngeneic allografts; 3) patient-derived xenograft (PDX) systems; and 4) patient-derived organoids (PDO).",Allografting;Architecture;Autologous;Behavior;Biological Models;Biology;Blood Vessels;Cancer Etiology;Cell Therapy;Cells;Cessation of life;Characteristics;Clinic;Coculture Techniques;Collagen;Complement;Complex;Cytotoxic Chemotherapy;Deposition;Disease;Disease Progression;Drug Delivery Systems;Education;Elements;Epithelial Cells;Evolution;Experimental Models;Extracellular Matrix;Extracellular Matrix Proteins;Fibrillar Collagen;Fibroblasts;Fibrosis;Friends;Functional disorder;Gel;Genetically Engineered Mouse;Glycosaminoglycans;Hematopoietic;Human;Hyaluronan;Immune;Immune response;Immunity;Immunosuppression;Immunotherapeutic agent;Investigation;KPC model;Liquid substance;Malignant neoplasm of pancreas;Mechanics;Mesenchymal;Minority;Modeling;Mus;Myeloid Cells;Myeloid-derived suppressor cells;Myofibroblast;Neoplasm Metastasis;Normal tissue morphology;Organ;Organoids;Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma;Pathogenesis;Patients;Perfusion;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phase;Physiologic pulse;Physiology;Population;Process;Proteoglycan;Regimen;Research Personnel;Seminal;Series;Signal Transduction;Structure;Surface;System;T-Lymphocyte;Toxic effect;Treatment Efficacy;Treatment Protocols;Tumor Immunity;Water;barrier to care;cell type;combinatorial;cytotoxic;hypoperfusion;improved;insight;interstitial;macrophage;monocyte;mouse model;next generation;novel;novel therapeutics;patient derived xenograft model;pressure;receptor;reconstitution;response;standard of care;therapy resistant;treatment strategy;tumor;tumor growth;tumor microenvironment;tumor-immune system interactions;tumorigenesis;tumorigenic,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,SEATTLE,WA,UNITED STATES,Sunil R Hingorani,Jeffrey Hildesheim,345859,345859,2021-08-10T12:08:00Z,2017-09-30T12:09:00Z,2022-03-31T12:03:00Z,RFA-CA-17-015,True duplicate in all columns.

The mechanisms underlying this benefit include normalization of cancer-associated fibroblasts and extracellular matrix (ECM), resulting in blood vessel decompression, improved perfusion, and decreased hypoxia. These exciting preclinical findings formed the basis of an ongoing Phase II clinical trial at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), which combines losartan with cytotoxic therapy  FOLFIRINOX and then chemoradiotherapy in unresectable locally advanced PDAC (NCT01821729). An interim analysis of this trial indicates that adding losartan to neoadjuvant cytotoxic therapy doubles the frequency of conversion to resectable tumors (52%) and strikingly improves overall survival (OS) in these PDAC patients. Remarkably, transcriptomic analysis of tumor biopsies from PDAC patients further indicates that ASI treatment not only normalizes ECM-related phenotypes but also upregulates key pathways associated with anti-tumor immunity involving both adaptive (e.g., CD8+ T cells) and innate (e.g., dendritic cells (DCs)) immune components of the PDAC tumor microenvironment. Based on these preclinical and clinical findings, we hypothesize that ASIs in combination with cytotoxic agents will reprogram the heterogeneous, pro-fibrotic, and immunosuppressive PDAC tumor microenvironment to one that is immunostimulatory. We further propose that combining ASIs and cytotoxic agents will enhance the delivery and efficacy of immunotherapies, which until now have had limited or no benefit in PDAC patients. To test these hypotheses, we designed three Specific Aims: 1) Uncover how losartan combined with cytotoxic agents alters tumor microenvironmental components (ECM, blood vessels, hypoxia) and immune cells, in locally advanced PDAC patients; 2) Dissect the causal role of drug- induced adaptive and innate immune cells in the anti-tumor response in orthotopic (implanted and genetically engineered) PDAC models in mice; and 3) Evaluate whether combining ASI-induced tumor microenvironment reprogramming along with cytotoxic therapies enhances the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockers. Based on our preclinical and clinical data, our tightly integrated and multidisciplinary team of investigators, and our bench-to-bedside-and-back research approach, we anticipate that successful completion of these studies will positively impact the development of new treatments for locally advanced PDAC patients who currently have a 5-year survival rate of ~11%. Moreover, because we will actively participate in the PDAC Consortium, the knowledge gained in these studies will be available for other studies of the immune tumor microenvironment in PDAC that are undertaken within the Consortium.

Although recent advances in immunotherapy have shown efficacy in various solid cancers, comparable efficacy in PDAC has been limited by a complex tumor microenvironment (TME) that creates an immune suppressive milieu ripe for tumor progression. Thus, bold interventions that can overcome immune barriers in the PDAC TME are urgently needed to reduce the mortality stemming from this recalcitrant disease. The U01 Consortium for PDAC Translational Studies on the TME was created through the National Cancer Moonshot initiative to accelerate the pace of progress in innovative therapies targeting the TME in PDAC, especially those geared towards immune-based modalities. Our proposal is in response to the companion U24 RFA to create a resource center for the five funded Consortium sites, which we call Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma Translational Resource Center (PATReC). The PATReC will be co-led by Drs. Ignacio Wistuba and Anirban Maitra, two established molecular pathologists at UT MD Anderson Cancer Center (UTMDACC) with long-standing expertise in cancer biomarkers, tissue based molecular profiling, and with respect to one co-leader (AM), specific expertise in PDAC biology, disease models and experimental therapeutics. They will be supported by an exceptional supporting cast, including Drs. Jack Lee (biostatistics), Andy Futreal (cancer genomics and computational biology), Jason Roszik (bioinformatics) and Stan Hamilton (co-leader of the NCI MATCH biorepository). The overall goal is to support the consortium efforts in multiple areas including: providing an administrative infrastructure for coordinated interactions amongst the U01 awardees; facilitating centralized biospecimen banking and distribution; enabling centralized data storage capabilities; and credentialed biostatistics and bioinformatics support with the ultimate goal of designing translationally relevant combination interventions targeting the TME in PDAC. In Aim 1, we will support administrative coordination amongst the U01 sites by ensuring effective communication, cooperation, and access to rapid data exchange that will advance the goals of the individual Consortium sites. The PATReC will serve as the central hub for virtual and in-person communication across the entire Consortium. In Aim 2, we will utilize our unique institutional infrastructure to provide centralized data management services that will be readily accessible to all Consortium sites via a secure website, and provide bioinformatics and biostatics services for the analyses and interpretation of data. In Aim 3, we will standardize bio-banking activities and develop standard operation procedures (SOPs) for biospecimen collection, processing and distribution, as well as provide access to biologically relevant PDAC preclinical resources. We envision that the PATReC will be an indispensable element as we make meaningful progress towards targeting the TME in this lethal disease.",Administrative Coordination;Algorithms;Antigens;Archives;Area;Bioinformatics;Biological;Biological Specimen Banks;Biology;Biometry;Cancer Center;Cancer Etiology;Cataloging;Cell Line;Cessation of life;Clinical Management;Clinical Research;Clinical Trials;Clinical Trials Data Monitoring Committees;Collection;Communication;Companions;Complex;Computational Biology;Credentialing;Data;Data Analyses;Data Storage and Retrieval;Diagnosis;Disease;Disease model;Elements;Enrollment;Ensure;Facility Accesses;Funding;Goals;Immune;Immunofluorescence Immunologic;Immunologic Monitoring;Immunotherapeutic agent;Immunotherapy;Incidence;Individual;Infrastructure;Innovative Therapy;Institution;Intervention;Investigational Therapies;Laboratory Research;Lead;Logistics;Malignant Neoplasms;Manuals;Methodology;Modality;Molecular;Molecular Profiling;Organ;Organoids;Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma;Participant;Pathologic;Pathologist;Pathology;Patients;Persons;Play;Procedures;Prognosis;Reagent;Research Design;Research Personnel;Resources;Role;Secure;Services;Site;Solid;Standardization;Survival Rate;Teleconferences;Therapeutic;Tissue Microarray;Tissues;Translational Research;Treatment Efficacy;United States;automated image analysis;base;biobank;cancer biomarkers;cancer genomics;cancer immunotherapy;clinically relevant;comparative efficacy;computerized tools;data dissemination;data exchange;data management;data tools;design;immune function;improved;innovation;material transfer agreement;meetings;member;mortality;multidisciplinary;operation;patient derived xenograft model;pre-clinical;preclinical study;programs;prospective;response;stem;synergism;targeted treatment;tool;translational study;tumor microenvironment;tumor progression;virtual;web portal;web site,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,HOUSTON,TX,UNITED STATES,Anirban Maitra;Subrata Sen,Peter Ujhazy,559976,559976,2021-08-12T12:08:00Z,2017-09-30T12:09:00Z,2022-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-17-016,True duplicate in all columns.

One possible reason for this is the unique biology of the pancreatic cancer in establishing an immune suppressive microenvironment. We find that cross communication between cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs), tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) and tumor cells is critical. Using animal models of PDA, we find that tumor cells polarize macrophages to TAMs both by activating CAFs to produce IL6 and by producing specific metabolites. TAMs then both suppress the immune response by arginine depletion by making Arginase 1 and by producing EGFR ligands, primarily HBEGF, to stimulate pancreatic cancer cells to express PDL1, an immune checkpoint ligand. We propose to use a combination of matched humanized patient derived xenografts (PDXs), organoid culture systems made up of cancer cells, immune cells and CAFs (ie microtumors) and a unique dual recombinase genetically engineered mouse model of PDA to test the hypothesis that treatment of tumors with inhibitors of STAT3, HBEGF, ARG1 or MEK will effectively synergize with PD1 inhibition, overcoming the powerful immune suppression created by the pancreatic cancer microenvironment.",Ablation;Adenocarcinoma Cell;Affect;Animal Model;Antigen-Antibody Complex;Arginine;Biocompatible Materials;Biological Models;Biology;CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes;Cancer Patient;Cell Communication;Cells;Communication;Complex;DTR gene;Engineering;Environment;Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor;Epithelial;Feedback;Fibroblasts;Genetically Engineered Mouse;Goals;Growth Factor;Human;IL6 gene;Immune;Immune checkpoint inhibitor;Immune response;Immune system;Immunosuppression;Immunosuppressive Agents;Immunotherapeutic agent;Immunotherapy;In Vitro;Infiltration;Inflammatory;Interruption;Lead;Ligands;MAP Kinase Gene;MEK inhibition;Malignant Neoplasms;Malignant neoplasm of pancreas;Mediating;Methods;Michigan;Modality;Myelogenous;Myeloid Cells;Neoplasm Metastasis;Neoplasm Transplantation;Organoids;PDCD1LG1 gene;Pancreas;Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma;Patients;Phenotype;Pre-Clinical Model;Process;Research;Research Personnel;Research Proposals;Role;STAT3 gene;Schools;Scientist;Series;Signal Transduction;Suppressor-Effector T-Lymphocytes;System;T-Lymphocyte;Testing;Therapeutic;Transplantation;Universities;Work;Xenograft procedure;arginase;base;cancer cell;cancer therapy;cell growth;checkpoint therapy;combat;cytokine;experience;fighting;immune checkpoint;in vivo;inhibitor/antagonist;innovation;intercellular communication;macrophage;medical schools;mouse model;neoplastic cell;novel;pancreatic cancer cells;pancreatic neoplasm;polarized cell;recombinase;response;scaffold;tumor;tumor growth;tumor microenvironment,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,ANN ARBOR,MI,UNITED STATES,Howard C Crawford;Marina Pasca Di Magliano,Jeffrey Hildesheim,1497616,1497616,2017-09-25T12:09:00Z,2017-09-30T12:09:00Z,2020-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-17-015,True duplicate in all columns.

Despite success in other cancer types, immunotherapy approaches in PDAC have not shown efficacy. PDAC demonstrates a heterogeneous and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) that is poorly understood and serves as a barrier to effective immunotherapy strategies in this disease. We propose that an improved understanding of the TME and novel approaches that target key tumor-stroma interactions will enable remodeling of the immunosuppressive TME to enhance the efficacy of current and future immunotherapy strategies. In particular, we believe that successful combination immunotherapy approaches in PDAC will include strategies that alter myeloid cells to relieve immunosuppression, cytotoxic therapies that target tumor cells to improve immune response, and agents that augment anti-tumor T cell activity. In this project, we will perform a comprehensive characterization of the PDAC TME in both primary and metastatic PDAC in the baseline untreated context as well as across multiple different clinical therapies. In Aim 1, we will utilize single-cell transcriptomic and proteomic technologies to provide a cellular atlas of the PDAC TME at unprecedented resolution. In Aim 2, we will examine how the PDAC TME changes with chemotherapy, radiation therapy and a novel CCR2 inhibitor that modulates macrophage recruitment in the TME. For these studies, we will utilize human samples derived from both resectable and metastatic patients on clinical trials at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. We will employ a novel ex vivo co-culture approach to enable rapid functional evaluation of tumor-stroma interactions and how they may impact immunotherapy responses. Lastly, in Aim 3 we will employ faithful immune competent PDAC mouse models and a novel cytokine delivery platform to investigate how targeted cytokine delivery to the TME may alter myeloid cell recruitment and function and improve immune responses. We have assembled a multi-disciplinary collaborative team including experts in PDAC biology and genetics, immunologists and translational oncologists to comprehensively study PDAC TME and identify novel opportunities to develop combination immunotherapy approaches in this devastating disease.",Aftercare;Atlases;Biology;Biopsy;Biopsy Specimen;CC chemokine receptor 2;CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes;Cancer Patient;Cells;Clinical;Clinical Trials;Coculture Techniques;Combined Modality Therapy;Complex;Cytotoxic Chemotherapy;Cytotoxic agent;Dana-Farber Cancer Institute;Desmoplastic;Devices;Disease;Elements;Evaluation;Evolution;Excision;FLT3LG gene;Fibroblasts;Future;Genetic;Genetically Engineered Mouse;Genomics;Heterogeneity;Human;Immune;Immune response;Immunofluorescence Immunologic;Immunologist;Immunosuppression;Immunosuppressive Agents;Immunotherapy;Infiltration;Interferon Type II;Interleukin-15;Lung Adenocarcinoma;Malignant - descriptor;Malignant Neoplasms;Malignant neoplasm of pancreas;Methods;Microfluidic Microchips;Microfluidics;Modeling;Mus;Myelogenous;Myeloid Cells;Nature;Neoadjuvant Therapy;Non-Malignant;Oncologist;Paclitaxel;Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma;Pathway interactions;Patient-Focused Outcomes;Patients;Periodicity;Phase;Phenotype;Play;Pre-Clinical Model;Proteomics;Radiation;Radiation therapy;Randomized;Recruitment Activity;Regimen;Renal Cell Carcinoma;Research;Resectable;Resolution;Role;Sampling;Specimen;Survival Rate;T cell response;T-Lymphocyte;Technology;Testing;Therapeutic;Therapeutic Agents;base;cancer type;cell type;chemotherapy;cytokine;effective therapy;gemcitabine;immune checkpoint blockade;immunoregulation;improved;inhibitor/antagonist;macrophage;melanoma;mouse model;multidisciplinary;neoplastic cell;novel;novel strategies;outcome forecast;pre-clinical;prevent;programs;response;spatial relationship;success;targeted delivery;targeted treatment;therapeutic evaluation;transcriptome;transcriptome sequencing;transcriptomics;tumor;tumor heterogeneity;tumor microenvironment,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,BOSTON,MA,UNITED STATES,William C Hahn,Steven F Nothwehr,1845039,1845039,2017-09-22T12:09:00Z,2017-09-30T12:09:00Z,2020-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-17-015,True duplicate in all columns.

Neoantigen load predicts immunotherapeutic response, validating antigen identification as a rational strategy of biomarker discovery. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) however has shown limited efficacy to checkpoint blockade immunotherapy due to presumed neoantigen paucity. However, systematic antigen discovery in PDAC is lacking. 3% of PDAC patients survive > 5 years (long term survivors). As T cell immunity may explain this extreme outcome, they represent the ideal cohort for deep antigen discovery. Using genomic, molecular, and cellular immunoprofiling, computational evolutionary modeling, and neoantigen discovery in these rare long term survivors (n=82), we have discovered that neoantigen quality, but not quantity, is prognostic of survival, and that long term survivors evidence lasting neoantigen-specific T cell immunity. The scientific objectives of this proposal are to address questions essential to translate these findings - 1) is there stage and treatment- specific neoantigen heterogeneity, 2) can neoantigens be identified in the peripheral blood, and 3) can neoantigen quality predict response to immunotherapy. The translational objective is to develop novel tissue and blood-based biomarkers for rational patient and target selection for immunotherapy. The proposal utilizes several highly unique tissue collection strategies  a) laparoscopic multi-site biopsies to identify stage-specific heterogeneity, b) serial pre- and post-chemotherapy assessment for treatment-specific modulation, and c) evaluation of neoantigen quality as a predictive biomarker on a large, immunotherapeutic PDAC trial. This initiative will also for the first time develop the ability to identify neoantigens in circulating exosomes for blood-based biomarker assessment. The research methodology employs next generation sequencing, transcriptional profiling, computational biophysical modeling, clonotypic T cell profiling, neoantigen discovery, and functional assessments to evaluate the prognostic, predictive, and therapeutic potential of neoantigens. The team comprises of world-class expert junior and senior investigators in a broad range of highly relevant disciplines from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Meyer Cancer Center at the Weill Cornell Medical Center, Tisch Cancer Institute at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and the Institute for Advanced Study.

One possible reason for this is the unique biology of the pancreatic cancer in establishing an immune suppressive microenvironment. We find that cross communication between cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs), tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) and tumor cells is critical. Using animal models of PDA, we find that tumor cells polarize macrophages to TAMs both by activating CAFs to produce IL6 and by producing specific metabolites. TAMs then both suppress the immune response by arginine depletion by making Arginase 1 and by producing EGFR ligands, primarily HBEGF, to stimulate pancreatic cancer cells to express PDL1, an immune checkpoint ligand. We propose to use a combination of matched humanized patient derived xenografts (PDXs), organoid culture systems made up of cancer cells, immune cells and CAFs (ie microtumors) and a unique dual recombinase genetically engineered mouse model of PDA to test the hypothesis that treatment of tumors with inhibitors of STAT3, HBEGF, ARG1 or MEK will effectively synergize with PD1 inhibition, overcoming the powerful immune suppression created by the pancreatic cancer microenvironment.",Ablation;Adenocarcinoma Cell;Affect;Animal Model;Antigen-Antibody Complex;Arginine;Biocompatible Materials;Biological Models;Biology;CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes;Cancer Patient;Cell Communication;Cells;Communication;Complex;DTR gene;Engineering;Environment;Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor;Epithelial;Epithelium;Feedback;Fibroblasts;Genetically Engineered Mouse;Goals;Growth Factor;Human;IL6 gene;Immune;Immune checkpoint inhibitor;Immune response;Immune system;Immunosuppression;Immunotherapeutic agent;Immunotherapy;In Vitro;Infiltration;Inflammatory;Interruption;Lead;Ligands;MAP Kinase Gene;MEK inhibition;MEKs;Malignant Neoplasms;Malignant neoplasm of pancreas;Mediating;Methods;Michigan;Modality;Myelogenous;Myeloid Cells;Myeloid-derived suppressor cells;Neoplasm Metastasis;Neoplasm Transplantation;Organoids;PD-1/PD-L1;Pancreas;Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma;Patients;Phenotype;Pre-Clinical Model;Process;Research;Research Personnel;Research Proposals;Role;STAT3 gene;Schools;Scientist;Series;Signal Transduction;System;T-Lymphocyte;Testing;Therapeutic;Transplantation;Tumor-associated macrophages;Universities;Work;Xenograft procedure;anti-tumor immune response;arginase;base;cancer cell;cancer immunotherapeutics;cancer therapy;checkpoint therapy;combat;cytokine;experience;fighting;immune checkpoint;in vivo;inhibitor/antagonist;innovation;intercellular communication;macrophage;medical schools;neoplastic cell;novel;pancreatic cancer cells;pancreatic neoplasm;polarized cell;programmed cell death ligand 1;programmed cell death protein 1;recombinase;response;scaffold;tumor;tumor growth;tumor microenvironment;tumor-immune system interactions,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,ANN ARBOR,MI,UNITED STATES,Howard C Crawford;Marina Pasca Di Magliano,Jeffrey Hildesheim,527973,527973,2020-09-21T12:09:00Z,2017-09-30T12:09:00Z,2022-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-17-015,True duplicate in all columns.

Despite success in other cancer types, immunotherapy approaches in PDAC have not shown efficacy. PDAC demonstrates a heterogeneous and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) that is poorly understood and serves as a barrier to effective immunotherapy strategies in this disease. We propose that an improved understanding of the TME and novel approaches that target key tumor-stroma interactions will enable remodeling of the immunosuppressive TME to enhance the efficacy of current and future immunotherapy strategies. In particular, we believe that successful combination immunotherapy approaches in PDAC will include strategies that alter myeloid cells to relieve immunosuppression, cytotoxic therapies that target tumor cells to improve immune response, and agents that augment anti-tumor T cell activity. In this project, we will perform a comprehensive characterization of the PDAC TME in both primary and metastatic PDAC in the baseline untreated context as well as across multiple different clinical therapies. In Aim 1, we will utilize single-cell transcriptomic and proteomic technologies to provide a cellular atlas of the PDAC TME at unprecedented resolution. In Aim 2, we will examine how the PDAC TME changes with chemotherapy, radiation therapy and a novel CCR2 inhibitor that modulates macrophage recruitment in the TME. For these studies, we will utilize human samples derived from both resectable and metastatic patients on clinical trials at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. We will employ a novel ex vivo co-culture approach to enable rapid functional evaluation of tumor-stroma interactions and how they may impact immunotherapy responses. Lastly, in Aim 3 we will employ faithful immune competent PDAC mouse models and a novel cytokine delivery platform to investigate how targeted cytokine delivery to the TME may alter myeloid cell recruitment and function and improve immune responses. We have assembled a multi-disciplinary collaborative team including experts in PDAC biology and genetics, immunologists and translational oncologists to comprehensively study PDAC TME and identify novel opportunities to develop combination immunotherapy approaches in this devastating disease.",Aftercare;Atlases;Biology;Biopsy;Biopsy Specimen;CC chemokine receptor 2;CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes;Cells;Chemotherapy and/or radiation;Clinical;Clinical Trials;Coculture Techniques;Combination immunotherapy;Combined Modality Therapy;Complex;Cytotoxic Chemotherapy;Cytotoxic agent;Dana-Farber Cancer Institute;Desmoplastic;Devices;Disease;Elements;Evaluation;Evolution;Excision;FLT3 ligand;Fibroblasts;Future;Genetic;Genetically Engineered Mouse;Genomics;Heterogeneity;Human;Immune;Immune response;Immunocompetent;Immunofluorescence Immunologic;Immunologist;Immunosuppression;Immunotherapy;Interferon Type II;Interleukin-15;Lung Adenocarcinoma;Malignant - descriptor;Malignant Neoplasms;Malignant neoplasm of pancreas;Methods;Microfluidic Microchips;Microfluidics;Modeling;Mus;Myelogenous;Myeloid Cells;Myeloid-derived suppressor cells;Nature;Neoadjuvant Therapy;Non-Malignant;Oncologist;Paclitaxel;Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma;Pathway interactions;Patient-Focused Outcomes;Patients;Periodicity;Phase Ib/II Clinical Trial;Phenotype;Play;Pre-Clinical Model;Proteomics;Radiation;Radiation therapy;Randomized;Regimen;Renal Cell Carcinoma;Research;Resectable;Resolution;Role;Sampling;Specimen;Survival Rate;T cell response;T-Lymphocyte;Technology;Testing;Therapeutic;Therapeutic Agents;Tumor-infiltrating immune cells;cancer type;cell type;checkpoint inhibition;chemotherapy;cytokine;early phase clinical trial;effective therapy;gemcitabine;immune checkpoint blockade;immunomodulatory strategy;immunomodulatory therapies;immunoregulation;improved;inhibitor/antagonist;macrophage;melanoma;mouse model;multidisciplinary;neoplastic cell;novel;novel strategies;outcome forecast;pancreatic cancer patients;pre-clinical;prevent;programs;recruit;response;single-cell RNA sequencing;spatial relationship;success;targeted delivery;targeted treatment;therapeutic evaluation;transcriptome;transcriptome sequencing;transcriptomics;treatment research;tumor;tumor heterogeneity;tumor microenvironment;tumor-immune system interactions,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,BOSTON,MA,UNITED STATES,William C Hahn,Steven F Nothwehr,611615,611615,2020-08-31T12:08:00Z,2017-09-30T12:09:00Z,2022-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-17-015,True duplicate in all columns.

Neoantigen load predicts immunotherapeutic response, validating antigen identification as a rational strategy of biomarker discovery. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) however has shown limited efficacy to checkpoint blockade immunotherapy due to presumed neoantigen paucity. However, systematic antigen discovery in PDAC is lacking. 3% of PDAC patients survive > 5 years (long term survivors). As T cell immunity may explain this extreme outcome, they represent the ideal cohort for deep antigen discovery. Using genomic, molecular, and cellular immunoprofiling, computational evolutionary modeling, and neoantigen discovery in these rare long term survivors (n=82), we have discovered that neoantigen quality, but not quantity, is prognostic of survival, and that long term survivors evidence lasting neoantigen-specific T cell immunity. The scientific objectives of this proposal are to address questions essential to translate these findings - 1) is there stage and treatment- specific neoantigen heterogeneity, 2) can neoantigens be identified in the peripheral blood, and 3) can neoantigen quality predict response to immunotherapy. The translational objective is to develop novel tissue and blood-based biomarkers for rational patient and target selection for immunotherapy. The proposal utilizes several highly unique tissue collection strategies  a) laparoscopic multi-site biopsies to identify stage-specific heterogeneity, b) serial pre- and post-chemotherapy assessment for treatment-specific modulation, and c) evaluation of neoantigen quality as a predictive biomarker on a large, immunotherapeutic PDAC trial. This initiative will also for the first time develop the ability to identify neoantigens in circulating exosomes for blood-based biomarker assessment. The research methodology employs next generation sequencing, transcriptional profiling, computational biophysical modeling, clonotypic T cell profiling, neoantigen discovery, and functional assessments to evaluate the prognostic, predictive, and therapeutic potential of neoantigens. The team comprises of world-class expert junior and senior investigators in a broad range of highly relevant disciplines from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Meyer Cancer Center at the Weill Cornell Medical Center, Tisch Cancer Institute at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and the Institute for Advanced Study.

Recent progress has identified essential barriers in this complex microenvironment that impede drug delivery and suppress immunity. These processes include the prohibitive interstitial pressures generated by high concentrations of hyaluronan (HA) complexed with water, dense fibrosis associated with fibrillar collagen deposition, and multiple classes of immunosuppressive and pro-tumorigenic cells such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells and macrophages. The team assembled in this project has made many of the seminal discoveries described above. In addition, we have developed several highly novel and powerful experimental platforms to rigorously interrogate the complex mechanisms and interactions among various compartments in the tumor microenvironment that collectively conspire to promote the survival of pancreas cancers and metastases and thwart treatment. Our overarching hypothesis is that significantly improving survival for PDA patients will require targeting not only the tumor epithelial cell, but also the three compartments that support its oncogenesis: hematopoietic, mesenchymal and extracellular matrix. In the following, we propose to investigate the combination of cytotoxic therapy with stromal disruption and myeloid cell modulations to maximize engagement of anti-tumor immunity and treatment efficacy. We will pursue these investigations in four distinct experimental platforms that offer complementary strengths and mitigate limitations: 1) genetically engineered mouse models (GEMM) of autochthonous PDA; 2) syngeneic allografts; 3) patient-derived xenograft (PDX) systems; and 4) patient-derived organoids (PDO).",Allografting;Architecture;Autologous;Behavior;Biological Models;Biology;Blood Vessels;Cancer Etiology;Cell Therapy;Cells;Cessation of life;Characteristics;Clinic;Coculture Techniques;Collagen;Complement;Complex;Cytotoxic Chemotherapy;Deposition;Disease;Disease Progression;Drug Delivery Systems;Education;Elements;Epithelial Cells;Evolution;Experimental Models;Extracellular Matrix;Extracellular Matrix Proteins;Fibrillar Collagen;Fibroblasts;Fibrosis;Friends;Functional disorder;Gel;Genetically Engineered Mouse;Glycosaminoglycans;Hematopoietic;Human;Hyaluronan;Immune;Immune response;Immunity;Immunosuppression;Immunotherapeutic agent;Investigation;Liquid substance;Malignant neoplasm of pancreas;Mechanics;Mesenchymal;Minority;Modeling;Mus;Myeloid Cells;Myeloid-derived suppressor cells;Myofibroblast;Neoplasm Metastasis;Normal tissue morphology;Organ;Organoids;Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma;Pathogenesis;Patients;Perfusion;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phase;Physiologic pulse;Physiology;Population;Process;Proteoglycan;Regimen;Research Personnel;Seminal;Series;Signal Transduction;Structure;Surface;System;T-Lymphocyte;Toxic effect;Treatment Efficacy;Treatment Protocols;Tumor Immunity;Water;Xenograft procedure;barrier to care;cell type;combinatorial;cytotoxic;hypoperfusion;improved;insight;interstitial;macrophage;monocyte;mouse model;next generation;novel;novel therapeutics;pressure;receptor;reconstitution;response;standard of care;therapy resistant;treatment strategy;tumor;tumor growth;tumor microenvironment;tumor-immune system interactions;tumorigenesis;tumorigenic,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,SEATTLE,WA,UNITED STATES,Sunil R Hingorani,Jeffrey Hildesheim,602955,602955,2020-09-01T12:09:00Z,2017-09-30T12:09:00Z,2022-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-17-015,True duplicate in all columns.

The mechanisms underlying this benefit include normalization of cancer-associated fibroblasts and extracellular matrix (ECM), resulting in blood vessel decompression, improved perfusion, and decreased hypoxia. These exciting preclinical findings formed the basis of an ongoing Phase II clinical trial at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), which combines losartan with cytotoxic therapy  FOLFIRINOX and then chemoradiotherapy in unresectable locally advanced PDAC (NCT01821729). An interim analysis of this trial indicates that adding losartan to neoadjuvant cytotoxic therapy doubles the frequency of conversion to resectable tumors (52%) and strikingly improves overall survival (OS) in these PDAC patients. Remarkably, transcriptomic analysis of tumor biopsies from PDAC patients further indicates that ASI treatment not only normalizes ECM-related phenotypes but also upregulates key pathways associated with anti-tumor immunity involving both adaptive (e.g., CD8+ T cells) and innate (e.g., dendritic cells (DCs)) immune components of the PDAC tumor microenvironment. Based on these preclinical and clinical findings, we hypothesize that ASIs in combination with cytotoxic agents will reprogram the heterogeneous, pro-fibrotic, and immunosuppressive PDAC tumor microenvironment to one that is immunostimulatory. We further propose that combining ASIs and cytotoxic agents will enhance the delivery and efficacy of immunotherapies, which until now have had limited or no benefit in PDAC patients. To test these hypotheses, we designed three Specific Aims: 1) Uncover how losartan combined with cytotoxic agents alters tumor microenvironmental components (ECM, blood vessels, hypoxia) and immune cells, in locally advanced PDAC patients; 2) Dissect the causal role of drug- induced adaptive and innate immune cells in the anti-tumor response in orthotopic (implanted and genetically engineered) PDAC models in mice; and 3) Evaluate whether combining ASI-induced tumor microenvironment reprogramming along with cytotoxic therapies enhances the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockers.

One possible reason for this is the unique biology of the pancreatic cancer in establishing an immune suppressive microenvironment. We find that cross communication between cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs), tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) and tumor cells is critical. Using animal models of PDA, we find that tumor cells polarize macrophages to TAMs both by activating CAFs to produce IL6 and by producing specific metabolites. TAMs then both suppress the immune response by arginine depletion by making Arginase 1 and by producing EGFR ligands, primarily HBEGF, to stimulate pancreatic cancer cells to express PDL1, an immune checkpoint ligand. We propose to use a combination of matched humanized patient derived xenografts (PDXs), organoid culture systems made up of cancer cells, immune cells and CAFs (ie microtumors) and a unique dual recombinase genetically engineered mouse model of PDA to test the hypothesis that treatment of tumors with inhibitors of STAT3, HBEGF, ARG1 or MEK will effectively synergize with PD1 inhibition, overcoming the powerful immune suppression created by the pancreatic cancer microenvironment.",Ablation;Affect;Animal Model;Antigen-Antibody Complex;Arginine;Biocompatible Materials;Biological Models;Biology;CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes;Cancer Patient;Cell Communication;Cells;Communication;Complex;DTR gene;Engineering;Environment;Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor;Epithelial;Feedback;Fibroblasts;Genetically Engineered Mouse;Goals;Growth Factor;Human;IL6 gene;Immune;Immune checkpoint inhibitor;Immune response;Immune system;Immunosuppression;Immunotherapeutic agent;Immunotherapy;In Vitro;Infiltration;Inflammatory;Interruption;Lead;Ligands;MAP Kinase Gene;MEK inhibition;MEKs;Malignant Neoplasms;Malignant neoplasm of pancreas;Mediating;Methods;Michigan;Modality;Myelogenous;Myeloid Cells;Myeloid-derived suppressor cells;Neoplasm Metastasis;Neoplasm Transplantation;Organoids;PD-1/PD-L1;Pancreas;Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma;Patients;Phenotype;Pre-Clinical Model;Process;Research;Research Personnel;Research Proposals;Role;STAT3 gene;Schools;Scientist;Series;Signal Transduction;System;T-Lymphocyte;Testing;Therapeutic;Transplantation;Tumor-associated macrophages;Universities;Work;anti-tumor immune response;arginase;base;cancer cell;cancer immunotherapeutics;cancer therapy;checkpoint therapy;combat;cytokine;experience;fighting;immune checkpoint;in vivo;inhibitor/antagonist;innovation;intercellular communication;macrophage;medical schools;neoplastic cell;novel;pancreatic cancer cells;pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cell;pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma model;pancreatic neoplasm;patient derived xenograft model;polarized cell;programmed cell death ligand 1;programmed cell death protein 1;recombinase;response;scaffold;tumor;tumor growth;tumor microenvironment;tumor-immune system interactions,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,ANN ARBOR,MI,UNITED STATES,Howard C Crawford;Marina Pasca Di Magliano,Jeffrey Hildesheim,527973,527973,2021-07-29T12:07:00Z,2017-09-30T12:09:00Z,2023-02-28T12:02:00Z,RFA-CA-17-015,True duplicate in all columns.

Despite success in other cancer types, immunotherapy approaches in PDAC have not shown efficacy. PDAC demonstrates a heterogeneous and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) that is poorly understood and serves as a barrier to effective immunotherapy strategies in this disease. We propose that an improved understanding of the TME and novel approaches that target key tumor-stroma interactions will enable remodeling of the immunosuppressive TME to enhance the efficacy of current and future immunotherapy strategies. In particular, we believe that successful combination immunotherapy approaches in PDAC will include strategies that alter myeloid cells to relieve immunosuppression, cytotoxic therapies that target tumor cells to improve immune response, and agents that augment anti-tumor T cell activity. In this project, we will perform a comprehensive characterization of the PDAC TME in both primary and metastatic PDAC in the baseline untreated context as well as across multiple different clinical therapies. In Aim 1, we will utilize single-cell transcriptomic and proteomic technologies to provide a cellular atlas of the PDAC TME at unprecedented resolution. In Aim 2, we will examine how the PDAC TME changes with chemotherapy, radiation therapy and a novel CCR2 inhibitor that modulates macrophage recruitment in the TME. For these studies, we will utilize human samples derived from both resectable and metastatic patients on clinical trials at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. We will employ a novel ex vivo co-culture approach to enable rapid functional evaluation of tumor-stroma interactions and how they may impact immunotherapy responses. Lastly, in Aim 3 we will employ faithful immune competent PDAC mouse models and a novel cytokine delivery platform to investigate how targeted cytokine delivery to the TME may alter myeloid cell recruitment and function and improve immune responses. We have assembled a multi-disciplinary collaborative team including experts in PDAC biology and genetics, immunologists and translational oncologists to comprehensively study PDAC TME and identify novel opportunities to develop combination immunotherapy approaches in this devastating disease.",Aftercare;Atlases;Biology;Biopsy;Biopsy Specimen;CC chemokine receptor 2;CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes;Cells;Chemotherapy and/or radiation;Clinical;Clinical Trials;Coculture Techniques;Combination immunotherapy;Combined Modality Therapy;Complex;Cytotoxic Chemotherapy;Cytotoxic agent;Dana-Farber Cancer Institute;Desmoplastic;Devices;Disease;Elements;Evaluation;Evolution;Excision;FLT3 ligand;Fibroblasts;Future;Genetic;Genetically Engineered Mouse;Genomics;Heterogeneity;Human;Immune;Immune response;Immunocompetent;Immunofluorescence Immunologic;Immunologist;Immunosuppression;Immunotherapy;Interferon Type II;Interleukin-15;KRASG12D;Lung Adenocarcinoma;Malignant - descriptor;Malignant Neoplasms;Malignant neoplasm of pancreas;Methods;Microfluidic Microchips;Microfluidics;Modeling;Mus;Myelogenous;Myeloid Cells;Myeloid-derived suppressor cells;Nature;Neoadjuvant Therapy;Non-Malignant;Oncologist;Paclitaxel;Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma;Pathway interactions;Patient-Focused Outcomes;Patients;Periodicity;Phase Ib/II Clinical Trial;Phenotype;Play;Pre-Clinical Model;Prognosis;Proteomics;Radiation;Radiation therapy;Randomized;Regimen;Renal Cell Carcinoma;Research;Resectable;Resolution;Role;Sampling;Specimen;Survival Rate;T cell response;T-Lymphocyte;Technology;Testing;Therapeutic;Therapeutic Agents;Tumor-infiltrating immune cells;cancer type;cell type;checkpoint inhibition;chemotherapy;cytokine;early phase clinical trial;effective therapy;gemcitabine;immune checkpoint blockade;immunomodulatory strategy;immunomodulatory therapies;immunoregulation;improved;inhibitor/antagonist;macrophage;melanoma;mouse model;multidisciplinary;neoplastic cell;novel;novel strategies;pancreatic cancer patients;pre-clinical;prevent;programs;recruit;response;single-cell RNA sequencing;spatial relationship;success;targeted delivery;targeted treatment;therapeutic evaluation;transcriptome;transcriptome sequencing;transcriptomics;treatment research;tumor;tumor heterogeneity;tumor microenvironment;tumor-immune system interactions,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,BOSTON,MA,UNITED STATES,William C Hahn,Steven F Nothwehr,568413,568413,2021-08-10T12:08:00Z,2017-09-30T12:09:00Z,2022-08-31T12:08:00Z,RFA-CA-17-015,True duplicate in all columns.

Neoantigen load predicts immunotherapeutic response, validating antigen identification as a rational strategy of biomarker discovery. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) however has shown limited efficacy to checkpoint blockade immunotherapy due to presumed neoantigen paucity. However, systematic antigen discovery in PDAC is lacking. 3% of PDAC patients survive > 5 years (long term survivors). As T cell immunity may explain this extreme outcome, they represent the ideal cohort for deep antigen discovery. Using genomic, molecular, and cellular immunoprofiling, computational evolutionary modeling, and neoantigen discovery in these rare long term survivors (n=82), we have discovered that neoantigen quality, but not quantity, is prognostic of survival, and that long term survivors evidence lasting neoantigen-specific T cell immunity. The scientific objectives of this proposal are to address questions essential to translate these findings - 1) is there stage and treatment- specific neoantigen heterogeneity, 2) can neoantigens be identified in the peripheral blood, and 3) can neoantigen quality predict response to immunotherapy. The translational objective is to develop novel tissue and blood-based biomarkers for rational patient and target selection for immunotherapy. The proposal utilizes several highly unique tissue collection strategies  a) laparoscopic multi-site biopsies to identify stage-specific heterogeneity, b) serial pre- and post-chemotherapy assessment for treatment-specific modulation, and c) evaluation of neoantigen quality as a predictive biomarker on a large, immunotherapeutic PDAC trial. This initiative will also for the first time develop the ability to identify neoantigens in circulating exosomes for blood-based biomarker assessment. The research methodology employs next generation sequencing, transcriptional profiling, computational biophysical modeling, clonotypic T cell profiling, neoantigen discovery, and functional assessments to evaluate the prognostic, predictive, and therapeutic potential of neoantigens. The team comprises of world-class expert junior and senior investigators in a broad range of highly relevant disciplines from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Meyer Cancer Center at the Weill Cornell Medical Center, Tisch Cancer Institute at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and the Institute for Advanced Study.

Recent progress has identified essential barriers in this complex microenvironment that impede drug delivery and suppress immunity. These processes include the prohibitive interstitial pressures generated by high concentrations of hyaluronan (HA) complexed with water, dense fibrosis associated with fibrillar collagen deposition, and multiple classes of immunosuppressive and pro-tumorigenic cells such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells and macrophages. The team assembled in this project has made many of the seminal discoveries described above. In addition, we have developed several highly novel and powerful experimental platforms to rigorously interrogate the complex mechanisms and interactions among various compartments in the tumor microenvironment that collectively conspire to promote the survival of pancreas cancers and metastases and thwart treatment. Our overarching hypothesis is that significantly improving survival for PDA patients will require targeting not only the tumor epithelial cell, but also the three compartments that support its oncogenesis: hematopoietic, mesenchymal and extracellular matrix. In the following, we propose to investigate the combination of cytotoxic therapy with stromal disruption and myeloid cell modulations to maximize engagement of anti-tumor immunity and treatment efficacy. We will pursue these investigations in four distinct experimental platforms that offer complementary strengths and mitigate limitations: 1) genetically engineered mouse models (GEMM) of autochthonous PDA; 2) syngeneic allografts; 3) patient-derived xenograft (PDX) systems; and 4) patient-derived organoids (PDO).",Allografting;Architecture;Autologous;Behavior;Biological Models;Biology;Blood Vessels;Cancer Etiology;Cell Therapy;Cells;Cessation of life;Characteristics;Clinic;Coculture Techniques;Collagen;Complement;Complex;Cytotoxic Chemotherapy;Deposition;Disease;Disease Progression;Drug Delivery Systems;Education;Elements;Epithelial Cells;Evolution;Experimental Models;Extracellular Matrix;Extracellular Matrix Proteins;Fibrillar Collagen;Fibroblasts;Fibrosis;Friends;Functional disorder;Gel;Genetically Engineered Mouse;Glycosaminoglycans;Hematopoietic;Human;Hyaluronan;Immune;Immune response;Immunity;Immunosuppression;Immunotherapeutic agent;Investigation;KPC model;Liquid substance;Malignant neoplasm of pancreas;Mechanics;Mesenchymal;Minority;Modeling;Mus;Myeloid Cells;Myeloid-derived suppressor cells;Myofibroblast;Neoplasm Metastasis;Normal tissue morphology;Organ;Organoids;Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma;Pathogenesis;Patients;Perfusion;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phase;Physiologic pulse;Physiology;Population;Process;Proteoglycan;Regimen;Research Personnel;Seminal;Series;Signal Transduction;Structure;Surface;System;T-Lymphocyte;Toxic effect;Treatment Efficacy;Treatment Protocols;Tumor Immunity;Water;barrier to care;cell type;combinatorial;cytotoxic;hypoperfusion;improved;insight;interstitial;macrophage;monocyte;mouse model;next generation;novel;novel therapeutics;patient derived xenograft model;pressure;receptor;reconstitution;response;standard of care;therapy resistant;treatment strategy;tumor;tumor growth;tumor microenvironment;tumor-immune system interactions;tumorigenesis;tumorigenic,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,SEATTLE,WA,UNITED STATES,Sunil R Hingorani,Jeffrey Hildesheim,345859,345859,2021-08-10T12:08:00Z,2017-09-30T12:09:00Z,2022-03-31T12:03:00Z,RFA-CA-17-015,True duplicate in all columns.

grant,5U01CA224348-03,U01CA224348,10251378,2021,Reprogramming PDAC tumor microenvironment to improve immunotherapy,"We have recently shown in preclinical studies using clinically relevant pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) models that angiotensin system inhibitors (ASIs), including the angiotensin receptor blocker losartan, can enhance the delivery and efficacy of cytotoxic agents by affecting the tumor microenvironment (PNAS 2011, Nat Commun 2013). The mechanisms underlying this benefit include normalization of cancer-associated fibroblasts and extracellular matrix (ECM), resulting in blood vessel decompression, improved perfusion, and decreased hypoxia. These exciting preclinical findings formed the basis of an ongoing Phase II clinical trial at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), which combines losartan with cytotoxic therapy  FOLFIRINOX and then chemoradiotherapy in unresectable locally advanced PDAC (NCT01821729). An interim analysis of this trial indicates that adding losartan to neoadjuvant cytotoxic therapy doubles the frequency of conversion to resectable tumors (52%) and strikingly improves overall survival (OS) in these PDAC patients. Remarkably, transcriptomic analysis of tumor biopsies from PDAC patients further indicates that ASI treatment not only normalizes ECM-related phenotypes but also upregulates key pathways associated with anti-tumor immunity involving both adaptive (e.g., CD8+ T cells) and innate (e.g., dendritic cells (DCs)) immune components of the PDAC tumor microenvironment. Based on these preclinical and clinical findings, we hypothesize that ASIs in combination with cytotoxic agents will reprogram the heterogeneous, pro-fibrotic, and immunosuppressive PDAC tumor microenvironment to one that is immunostimulatory. We further propose that combining ASIs and cytotoxic agents will enhance the delivery and efficacy of immunotherapies, which until now have had limited or no benefit in PDAC patients. To test these hypotheses, we designed three Specific Aims: 1) Uncover how losartan combined with cytotoxic agents alters tumor microenvironmental components (ECM, blood vessels, hypoxia) and immune cells, in locally advanced PDAC patients; 2) Dissect the causal role of drug- induced adaptive and innate immune cells in the anti-tumor response in orthotopic (implanted and genetically engineered) PDAC models in mice; and 3) Evaluate whether combining ASI-induced tumor microenvironment reprogramming along with cytotoxic therapies enhances the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockers. Based on our preclinical and clinical data, our tightly integrated and multidisciplinary team of investigators, and our bench-to-bedside-and-back research approach, we anticipate that successful completion of these studies will positively impact the development of new treatments for locally advanced PDAC patients who currently have a 5-year survival rate of ~11%. Moreover, because we will actively participate in the PDAC Consortium, the knowledge gained in these studies will be available for other studies of the immune tumor microenvironment in PDAC that are undertaken within the Consortium.

Although recent advances in immunotherapy have shown efficacy in various solid cancers, comparable efficacy in PDAC has been limited by a complex tumor microenvironment (TME) that creates an immune suppressive milieu ripe for tumor progression. Thus, bold interventions that can overcome immune barriers in the PDAC TME are urgently needed to reduce the mortality stemming from this recalcitrant disease. The U01 Consortium for PDAC Translational Studies on the TME was created through the National Cancer Moonshot initiative to accelerate the pace of progress in innovative therapies targeting the TME in PDAC, especially those geared towards immune-based modalities. Our proposal is in response to the companion U24 RFA to create a resource center for the five funded Consortium sites, which we call Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma Translational Resource Center (PATReC). The PATReC will be co-led by Drs. Ignacio Wistuba and Anirban Maitra, two established molecular pathologists at UT MD Anderson Cancer Center (UTMDACC) with long-standing expertise in cancer biomarkers, tissue based molecular profiling, and with respect to one co-leader (AM), specific expertise in PDAC biology, disease models and experimental therapeutics. They will be supported by an exceptional supporting cast, including Drs. Jack Lee (biostatistics), Andy Futreal (cancer genomics and computational biology), Jason Roszik (bioinformatics) and Stan Hamilton (co-leader of the NCI MATCH biorepository). The overall goal is to support the consortium efforts in multiple areas including: providing an administrative infrastructure for coordinated interactions amongst the U01 awardees; facilitating centralized biospecimen banking and distribution; enabling centralized data storage capabilities; and credentialed biostatistics and bioinformatics support with the ultimate goal of designing translationally relevant combination interventions targeting the TME in PDAC. In Aim 1, we will support administrative coordination amongst the U01 sites by ensuring effective communication, cooperation, and access to rapid data exchange that will advance the goals of the individual Consortium sites. The PATReC will serve as the central hub for virtual and in-person communication across the entire Consortium. In Aim 2, we will utilize our unique institutional infrastructure to provide centralized data management services that will be readily accessible to all Consortium sites via a secure website, and provide bioinformatics and biostatics services for the analyses and interpretation of data. In Aim 3, we will standardize bio-banking activities and develop standard operation procedures (SOPs) for biospecimen collection, processing and distribution, as well as provide access to biologically relevant PDAC preclinical resources.
